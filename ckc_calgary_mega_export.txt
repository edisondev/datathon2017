"674"	"Alberta Animal Rescue Crew Society (AARCS)"	"1"	"<p>It was early December and the weather forecast was calling for a blizzard and freezing temperatures when the phone rang. A concerned citizen had noticed a stray dog on their property had given birth under their shed.</p><p>Recognizing that the pups wouldn&rsquo;t survive a blizzard, rescuers immediately packed up the truck and made the three-hour drive to a property near Rocky Mountain House.</p><p>When they arrived they found a very scared momma dog peaking her head out from under the shed. Skinny and terrified she was doing her best to keep her six puppies warm and fed. The rescuers tried to coax her close enough to get a leash around her head, but she was too smart and quick. Four puppies came out from under the shed to see what was going on and rescuers quickly scooped them up. They were placed in a basket filled with blankets and put in the warm truck. The remaining two puppies were wary just like their momma.</p><p>The wind was blowing and the snow was starting to come down, the storm was fast approaching. Rescuers tried everything to encourage the dogs to come out on their own but with no luck.&nbsp; Finally, with just enough space, rescuers crawled on their stomach under the shed. They were able to get a leash around momma&rsquo;s neck and pull her out along with the remaining pups. They were all placed in the warm truck for the ride to a foster home.</p><p>To our surprise momma dog (whom we named Maya) crawled up, laid her head on her rescuers lap, closed her eyes and fell fast asleep. She and her little family of six were finally safe. It&rsquo;s like she knew everything was going to be OK.</p><p>The trip home took almost 5 hours due to increasingly bad road conditions. When the family arrived Maya was given a big bowl of food and water and her and her puppies a warm, safe bed.</p><p>The blizzard came in full force and lasted five days, without that phone call and the rescue crew&rsquo;s quick action these little puppies would have perished in the cold dark of night. Instead Maya and pups are enjoying life in adoptive homes.</p>"	"public://org_profile/AARCS_ckc-2.jpg"	"Alberta Animal Rescue Crew Society (AARCS) "	"Adopt - Foster - Volunteer - Donate"	"<p>AARCS was founded in 2006 by a small group of people who were looking to make a difference in the lives of animals and has grown into a vast network of volunteers, foster homes, and supporters. We now have over 1200 volunteers across the province with our head office in Calgary and a satellite office in Edmonton. Our volunteers range in age from young children to seniors all looking to create a more compassionate world for animals.</p><p>AARCS began with&nbsp;<a href=""http://aarcs.ca/3-rs-rescue-rehabilitate-and-re-home/""><strong>r</strong></a><strong><a href=""http://aarcs.ca/3-rs-rescue-rehabilitate-and-re-home/"">escuing and rehoming&nbsp;</a></strong>homeless, abandoned, and surrendered animals and to-date have found new, loving homes for more than 12,000 pets. We knew there would be an endless number of homeless animals if we didn&rsquo;t strive to end animal homelessness at the root of the issue. We needed to share information and help the public understand the value of responsible pet guardianship through&nbsp;<strong><a href=""http://aarcs.ca/spayneuter-initiatives/"">Spay and Neuter Initiatives</a>&nbsp;</strong>while providing <a href=""http://aarcs.ca/assistance-programs/""><strong>assistance programs</strong>&nbsp;</a>to keep pets in their homes whenever possible.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2012 AARCS opened an animal shelter in Calgary, &nbsp;dubbed&nbsp;<strong><a href=""http://aarcs.ca/capital-campaign/"">Safe Haven</a></strong>, which is designed to provide temporary housing, emergency shelter and quarantine for newly rescued animals. In 2017, AARCS will be moving and expanding operations to a new facility in SE Calgary which will include a <a href=""http://aarcs.ca/veterinary-needs/""><strong>3,000 square foot Veterinary Hospital</strong></a>. This is a big step for AARCS and enhanced the ability to help even more animals. While a shelter is a great tool for initial intake, AARCS&#39; remain foster-home based as we believe a home is the best environment for adoptable pets to live while we search for a great adoptive family. The shelter offers temporary holding space and allows for medical and parasite treatment for new arrivals prior to entering volunteer foster homes, as well as a space to temporarily hold owned animals participating in our Spay/Neuter Assistance Program. The shelter is manned by volunteers and is open to our rescued animals 365 days a year.</p><p>In 2013, AARCS stepped up during the floods in central Alberta helping rescue hundreds of stranded and displaced pets. Recognizing the huge need for emergency response as it relates to humans and their pets, this challenging event prompted the development of our&nbsp;<strong>Emergency/ Disaster Relief Program</strong>. In 2016 AARCS Rescue Crews were called in to help rescue thousands of stranded pets during the devestating fires in Fort McMurray.&nbsp;</p><p>Today AARCS continues to help in almost any situation where pets are in need of assistance. We are a community partner specializing in pets and their people. We continue to share information with the public through&nbsp;<a href=""http://aarcs.ca/humane-education-program/""><strong>Humane Education and Outreach&nbsp;</strong></a>while providing community support programs where needs arise.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><em>Every once in awhile people ask me how I can foster. &ldquo;It must be so hard to let them go,&rdquo; they say. Yes it is hard, but so worth it. I love them all and think about them all of the time. But without people who step up to foster, organizations like AARCS couldn&rsquo;t help save these animals. So if you ever thought about fostering, now is the time. As it gets colder, AARCS gets more calls of animals in need and the more foster families they have the more animals we can save!&rdquo; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- </em>Kyle Sommerville, AARCS Foster Parent&nbsp;</li></ul>"	"public://org_profile/puppies_0.jpg"	"3 puppies sitting together"	"With more foster families, we can save more animals!"

All the animals that come through our program are spayed or neutered, vaccinated and treated for parasites prior to adoption.</p><p><a href=""http://aarcs.ca/spayneuter-initiatives/""><strong>Spay/Neuter &amp; Disease Prevention Initiative:</strong></a> This program offers spay/neuter surgeries for low-income and First Nation pet owners in Alberta. This program gets us one step closer to ending over population of animals in our province. Similarly, we offer TNR (Trap/neuter and return) services. TNR is a method of humanely trapping unaltered feral (wild) cats, spay/neutering the entire population and returning them to the location where they where found to be supported by a caretaker. TNR is considered a humane and more effective alternative to euthanasia for managing and reducing feral cat populations.</p><p><strong>Emergency and Disaster Response: </strong>AARCS highly experienced Disaster Animal Response Team is able to be on the front lines of any disaster or emergency &ndash; from floods, to fires, to hoarding or puppy mill seizures.

In fact, if there&rsquo;s one thing humans across the globe can agree on, it&rsquo;s that no one wants to hear the words, &ldquo;you have cancer.&rdquo; So everyone is in favor of better care, facilities and above all else, outcomes. Together with the brightest minds in research and compassionate care, the Alberta Cancer Foundation is making life better for Albertans facing cancer.</p><p>We stand alongside every Albertan who hears those fateful words &ldquo;you have cancer,&rdquo; by pushing the pace of progress that leads to faster diagnoses, groundbreaking research and leading-edge treatments.</p><p>We don&rsquo;t do this alone - we bring together donors, patients, healthcare providers and researchers, because we know this is the fastest way to close the gap between diagnosis and cure. We are the official fundraising partner for all 17 cancer centres in Alberta, including the Tom Baker Cancer Centre in Calgary and the Cross Cancer Institute in Edmonton. Through this partnership, we are able to make the most significant impact for patients, right at the point of care.</p><p>We do not exist to raise money&hellip;we raise money as a means to an end. We invest your money with a clear line of sight to patient outcomes. We invest donor dollars in initiatives that provide real-life returns. We measure the returns on investment in results, outcomes and impacts. Cancer patients returning to their lives. Parents returning to young children. Employees returning to work. People from all over our province returning, in the thousands, to their communities.

In cancer research, we think ROI stands for Results, Outcome and Impact&mdash;everything that directly improves patients&rsquo; lives. Think about what might happen if the Alberta Cancer Foundation wasn&rsquo;t here to invest in certain programs.</p><p>For example, without our donor dollars and strategic investment model, 6,000 Albertans would not have been able to take part in clinical trials over the past five years. More than 1,800 Albertans would have to worry about how to pay their mortgage or make financial ends meet, instead of being able to concentrate on healing&mdash;as your dollars allow them to do now. This time next year, we may be able to say that we saved 100 people from dying of lung cancer, thanks to our investment into a provincial screening program we support.

Tests ordered by her family doctor came back normal. The pain resurfaced and Maddie went to the Alberta Children&rsquo;s Hospital, where specialists noticed her spleen seemed enlarged and ordered some scans. Soon, Maddie and her family were given a shocking and devastating diagnosis. She had a cancerous mass called neuroblastoma that was 20 cm by 10 cm in size located behind her spleen and wrapped around her aorta.</p><p>Because it was too risky to operate, Maddie underwent four rounds of chemotherapy to try and shrink the tumour. It caused her to become very sick and she even woke up Christmas morning with her hair falling out. Unfortunately, even after chemo, the mass remained, so despite the risks, it was determined surgery was the only option. Her surgery team set out to remove the majority of the tumour but, in the end, removed all 15 lbs. of it during a 14-hour operation.</p><p>Maddie is now leading a happy and healthy life and using her outgoing personality and quick wit for good. She, along with friends, family and supporters, have raised tens of thousands of dollars for the Alberta Children&rsquo;s Hospital Foundation to help other kids.

Likewise, the Foundation is represented on the Hospital Management Council and the Child Health Advisory Committee.</p><p>While changes have been made in health care over the years, the principle on which the hospital was founded remains the same: &nbsp;The Alberta Children&#39;s Hospital is dedicated to providing the finest possible health care for our children. Today&#39;s challenge is to maintain these exceptional standards at a time when pediatric practice is changing. Calgary&#39;s population is growing rapidly and new advances in treatment and medical equipment are available, but expensive.</p><p>The generous support received by the Foundation from our many donors is a constant source of encouragement and hope to the patients, families and staff of the hospital. This funding serves to enhance not only the quality of health care, but also the quality of life for our children.</p><p>These are just a few of the many initiatives and programs made possible with donations from the community.</p><ul><li><a href=""http://www.childrenshospital.ab.ca/site/PageNavigator/news_events/TherapeuticArts.html""><strong>Therapeutic Arts</strong></a> &ndash; It&rsquo;s incredible to see the difference that music, art, plants and animals can make in a child&rsquo;s recovery.

Hospital at Home allows some children to receive portions of their treatment, such as chemotherapy infusions, in the comfort of their own homes, thanks to &ldquo;house calls&rdquo; by specialists. This relieves much of the time and financial pressures for families, as well as the emotional stress of regular visits to the hospital.</li></ul><ul><li><a href=""http://www.childrenshospital.ab.ca/rotaryflameshouse""><strong>Rotary Flames House</strong> </a>&ndash; Located adjacent to the Alberta Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Rotary Flames House provides respite and end-of-life care to children with complex and life-limiting medical conditions. Donor dollars made the construction of this special home possible and community support ensures that families and caregivers benefit from respite services and day programming. Respite care not only allows for families to get much needed rest and renewal, it provides recreational, social and developmental opportunities for patients as well.</li></ul><ul><li><a href=""http://www.childrenshospital.ab.ca/site/PageNavigator/research_institute/research""><strong>Research</strong> </a>&ndash; Thanks to generous community support, there are more than 200&nbsp;researchers at the Alberta Children&rsquo;s Hospital and the Alberta Children&rsquo;s Hospital Research Institute working to increase knowledge about childhood disease, develop new and better drug therapies and eradicate disease for future generations. With your help, our scientists can help ensure that more children live longer, with fewer lasting side effects and to their fullest potential.

The last time this opportunity existed was 20 years ago. At that time, our Executive Director Gareth Thomson successfully worked with Education staff to add a wetlands unit to the fifth grade curriculum; since that time almost 1 million Alberta youth have gone through that unit to experientially understand and appreciate the complex nature of the wetland ecosystem.</p><p>Now, we&rsquo;re working to infuse environmental, energy, and climate change education in to multiple subject areas. Working in collaboration with Alberta Education, ACEE will positively impact the new curriculum development. Education Minister David Eggen paralleled ACEE&#39;s hope and direction in his keynote address at the Edmonton area Education on Planet Earth conference by saying <em>&quot;We cannot look at environmentalism the same way that we have for the last 20 years. We&rsquo;ve moved a long ways to evolve and to make sure it is not a separate subject but it is infused in all subject areas all the time, through mathematics, physics, chemistry, social studies, economics and career and life management&hellip; to connect ourselves with our natural climate and to connect ourselves with a more diversified economy.&rdquo;</em></p><p>ACEE&#39;s accomplishments in&nbsp;<strong>guiding children and youth to become environmental leaders</strong>&nbsp;are really their accomplishments. We are proud of our students - and excited that our work with them is making a difference! In early 2016, we engaged with Alberta youth who created &ldquo;How Alberta Schools should show Climate Leadership&rdquo;, a set of recommendations for leaders capturing the knowledge, opinions, and passion of over 3000 students. Premier Rachel Notley met with our students and on June 7, 2016 students presented their recommendations to the Ministers of Education and Environment &amp; Parks. The students&#39; work figured prominently in the October 26, 2016 announcement of nine million dollars to ensure that new schools will all have solar panels:&nbsp;<em>&quot;The recommendation of the solar panels actually came from students themselves with the work that Gareth Thomson and The Alberta Council of Environmental Education has been doing. We took their suggestions from the white paper and put them to action. We had the chance to meet with some of the brilliant young people behind that work this spring, myself and Shannon Phillips, and we are following through on more of their recommendations in the months ahead.&quot;&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;~Education Minister David Eggen&nbsp;</p><p>ACEE is well respected in the environmental education community and is especially&nbsp;<strong>known for its partnerships and professional development.</strong>&nbsp;Through conferences, workshops, celebration events and reconnection retreats ACEE convenes groups to learn from each other and create cooperative synergies together.

Accredited through the Alberta Veterinary Medical Association, AIWC serves the needs of Alberta&rsquo;s diverse wildlife in Calgary and southern Alberta. As a registered charity, AIWC relies on charitable donations and dedicated volunteers to support the more than 1,600 varied animals in need of care every year. AIWC welcomes Alberta&rsquo;s injured, orphaned, and oiled wildlife, small and large, from hummingbirds to moose calves.</p><p><strong>Our Vision &nbsp;</strong>Every wild life matters.</p><p><strong>Our Mission &nbsp;</strong>AIWC is committed to the rescue, rehabilitation, and release of injured and orphaned wildlife. We provide expert advice and education that fosters an appreciation of wildlife.</p><p>Once animals arrive at AIWC they are fully examined to determine the extent of their injuries. Further testing is often required, such as blood and/or fecal sampling, and radiograph diagnostics. With the completion of our surgical suite in 2009, patients are no longer transported to an off-site clinic for procedures which greatly reduces their stress levels.</p><p>At the clinic, our staff and volunteers provide treatment and supportive care to the wildlife patients. Each patient&rsquo;s diet varies, being as close as possible to its natural diet. In the case of orphaned animals, they must be taught to forage or hunt for their own food as they develop.</p><p>As an animal progresses, gaining strength, and injuries healing, it will be moved into larger enclosures and finally be moved into an outdoor enclosure. When housed outside, the animal can properly prepare for release back into the wild by conditioning its body and acclimatizing to the weather. Once an animal is strong enough, volunteers often get the opportunity to release the animal back into its natural habitat. When possible and where safe to do so, we release the animal back to where it was found.

"381"	"Alberta Riparian Habitat Management Society (Cows and Fish)"	"1"	"<p>It&rsquo;s a bright-blue, warm spring day in early June. Forty grim faced people are squeezed&nbsp;into a community hall to talk about the state of their lake. Comments ricochet around the&nbsp;room: &ldquo;<em>I used to swim here as a child, but wouldn&rsquo;t&nbsp;chance it now</em>&rdquo;; &ldquo;<em>it&rsquo;s a long walk to the water</em>&rdquo;; and, &ldquo;<em>the lake stinks</em>&rdquo;. The realization of&nbsp;all the incremental and insidious changes of the past decades now cascades upon them.</p><p>They chafe at the unfairness of it, that they are stuck in a community hall faced with&nbsp;these changes, instead of being out, enjoying their little piece of paradise. &ldquo;<em>We&rsquo;ve got to&nbsp;fix it</em>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<em>we want our children to play here</em>&rdquo;, and the equally as telling comment, &ldquo;<em>the&nbsp;value of my property is dropping</em>&rdquo; embody the worried comments of the crowd. In the&nbsp;transition from awareness&nbsp;to action, we&rsquo;re still a ways from an understanding that this is no small&nbsp;repair job, a circumstance that won&rsquo;t be turned around tomorrow. &ldquo;We just want it back&nbsp;to the pretty little spot it was.&rdquo; That may be wishful thinking, given the rapid escalation&nbsp;in the ageing process of the lake, exacerbated by shoreline development and nutrients&nbsp;delivered from the watershed.</p><p>It may well be that&nbsp;the lake never was quite&nbsp;the &ldquo;<em>pretty little spot</em>&rdquo;, given the tendency of most&nbsp;central Alberta lakes to be high in nutrients, naturally. Their lake was probably always subject to some&nbsp;algae blooms, but now they are happening most years. An old-timer in the group quietly confirms this with me, privately, during the coffee break. His observations are that the magnitude of problems&nbsp;has grown with lakeshore development and expansion of agriculture and acreages in the surrounding watershed.</p><p>Others would like to reach into their blame holsters and, like the gunfighters of old, point&nbsp;their .45 calibre fingers at someone else. Between the farmers present and the lakefront residents,&nbsp;there is a heated exchange over who did&nbsp;what and when to the lake. It is a natural human tendency to see the collective impacts of others, but harder to see your own personal role in the issues that result from a series of long, slow, cumulative changes. This group will take a while to realize the&nbsp;ownership of the issues includes all of them.</p><p>They listen politely, if albeit somewhat sceptically, to the words and images of our&nbsp;Riparian 101 presentation. This&nbsp;description of the ecological functions of their lake begins to help them unravel some of&nbsp;the mystery of the watershed, lakeshore and landscape under their tenure. Not all are&nbsp;instant believers, but it sets up a bit of uncertainty which can only be assuaged through&nbsp;more information.</p><p>Cows and Fish never sets out to educate people about their watershed&nbsp;in one blinding flash of knowledge. Rather, it is a process of building a cumulative body&nbsp;of knowledge, over time that creates, within individuals and the community, the capacity&nbsp;to make better or more appropriate decisions. The world we live in is a complex one, but&nbsp;some elemental knowledge is required to allow us to fit into it, in a way that doesn&rsquo;t&nbsp;preclude options for the future.</p><p>- story written by Lorne Fitch, P.

Riparian areas are lands adjacent to streams, rivers, lakes and wetlands, where the vegetation and soils are strongly influenced by the presence of water. Although they make up only a small fraction of the land, they are among the most productive and valuable of all landscape types and have been a focus of conflicts between resource users.</p><p>Riparian areas need to be healthy to function properly. Some of those functions include trapping sediments, recharging ground water, providing primary productivity, and supporting biodiversity. We help cattle producers, lakefront residents,&nbsp;landowners, and their communities understand how healthy their riparian areas are, both on their individual operations and in their local watersheds. Understanding riparian health, or function, allows entire communities and individual producers to identify concerns and to proactively address specific land use issues.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Our Mission:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>To promote the improvement of riparian areas, their ecological processes and functions, through a collaborative partnership and voluntary, proactive community-based action that uses education and awareness about management options for producers, other landowners and their communities.</p><p class=""NormalContentBold""><strong>Our Objectives:</strong></p><ul><li class=""NormalContent"">to promote an understanding of riparian health and function</li><li class=""NormalContent"">to communicate the benefits of good riparian management</li><li class=""NormalContent"">to promote proactive voluntary solutions to riparian area conflicts</li><li class=""NormalContent"">to demonstrate value of cooperative, interdisciplinary and community efforts in resolving resource conflicts and addressing management challenges</li><li class=""NormalContent"">to improve the overall productivity and health of Alberta&#39;s landscapes and communities</li></ul><p class=""NormalContent"">Riparian health assessment relies on visual observation, a little practice and fine-tuning your &#39;eye&#39; to accurately interpret the health or function of a riparian area.

Amanda&rsquo;s wedding day was nearing and she wanted nothing more than to have her papa (as she called him), walk her down the aisle on her special day. As Gerald&rsquo;s ALS diagnosis progressed, the wedding was set to take place at the Misericordia Hospital in Edmonton where he was being cared for.&nbsp;Amanda&rsquo;s wedding day dream became a reality when Gerald was able to guide her down the aisle, thanks to help and support of the ALS Society of Alberta.</p><h3><strong>What is Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)?</strong></h3><p>ALS is a rapid, always fatal, neurodegenerative disease. It attacks the nerves that the body would normally use to send messages from the brain to the muscle, resulting in weakness and wasting. Eventually, the individual with ALS is left completely immobilized, with loss of speech and eventually an inability to swallow and breathe.&nbsp;The sensory neurons in people living with ALS continue to function normally so that they will continue to feel the sensations of heat, cold, discomfort, etc. The mind often remains completely alert and lucid. The result is often a lively, unimpaired mind trapped in an immobilized body. The average life expectancy from symptom onset is three to five years; the real challenge in the medical community at large is correctly diagnosing ALS in the early stages, so that the ALS Society of Alberta is able to provide the maximum level of assistance to the person living with ALS and that person&#39;s family.&nbsp;</p><p>Approximately 3,000 Canadians live with ALS and two to three Canadians die every day of ALS.

By 1994, she was known as the &ldquo;Dog Lady.&rdquo; After being approached by the Animal Control Officer of the Siksika Nation, Laurie became aware of the huge dog and cat over-population problem in Alberta&rsquo;s First Nations communities and decided to take on the enormous task of rescuing those dogs and cats and finding homes for them.</p><p>Once she started, it became apparent that one person alone could not handle the influx of dogs and cats, so Laurie, along with the help of two friends, decided to form a charitable organization and in July 1995, the Animal Rescue Foundation (ARF) of Alberta was formed.</p><p>A volunteer&#39;s story...</p><p><em>First, I would like to thank you for the amazing experience of being a foster home. It is by far the most rewarding volunteer opportunity that I&rsquo;ve had. </em></p><p><em>It isn&rsquo;t always easy, but being able to be such a big part of finding a dog their forever home is more than worth it. We have been fostering with ARF for almost two years now and we&rsquo;ve helped about 20 dogs and puppies on their way to their forever homes.</em></p><p><em>But of course the biggest thing we are thankful for is that without ARF we never would have met our two amazing dogs Echo (husky) and Bailey. Echo started out with us as a foster and he struggled with separation anxiety and reactivity towards other dogs. I am happy to report that with a huge amount of support from ARF, working with Dogma Training and a lot of perseverance and patience Echo is now a perfect gentleman out on walks and is more than content hanging out at home alone.</em></p><p><em>Bailey came to us at about six weeks old when we decided to try our hand at being a holding home for puppies until they are old enough to go to individual foster homes. Unfortunately, our stone cold hearts were no match for her wrinkly face or puppy antics and we formally adopted her as soon as she was eight weeks old. She has been the perfect puppy (knock on wood) and she continues to impress us every day. Together with our cat they make a great team showing our foster dogs the ropes and helping them to gain confidence.</em></p><p><em>Thank you ARF for everything you do and continue to do.&nbsp; We look forward to many more years fostering and volunteering with ARF. </em></p><p>- Chloe, Braden, Echo, Bailey and Atticus (The Cat)</p>"	"public://org_profile/ARF Pad4Paws Campaign Web Snippet.JPG"	"Rescued litter of puppies "	"Puppies now live in their ""forever"" homes"	"<p>Founded in 1995, ARF&#39;s mission is to rescue stray and unwanted dogs and cats from First Nations and rural areas and place them in loving, permanent homes while providing programs to reduce pet over-population. ARF is one of the most long-standing animal rescue groups in the community and is recognized as a well-run, fiscally responsible charity. ARF&#39;s&nbsp;high rate of&nbsp;success is measured by low numbers of returned animals as a result of good&nbsp;pet/owner matches.&nbsp;</p><p>ARF is a no-kill rescue and our philosophy is to&nbsp;to foster the humane, compassionate and respectful treatment of all dogs and cats.&nbsp;Each year, ARF works to rescue countless&nbsp;stray and abandoned dogs and cats&nbsp; in order to give them a second&nbsp;chance. These animals have faced many&nbsp;hardships ranging from hunger, disease,&nbsp;abuse, and freezing temperatures to&nbsp;encounters with predators and vehicles.&nbsp;Once rescued, ARF animals are placed in&nbsp;loving, caring foster homes where they&nbsp;await adoption. In addition to warmth and&nbsp;love, they also receive the veterinary care and medical assistance they need to grow strong and live a healthy&nbsp;life.

We received a call about an injured puppy and went out to see how we could help her. It is likely her injuries were due to an attack by another animal.

Due to some muscle atrophy around the injury site, it seems like this injury was&nbsp;one that occurred previous to the attack.</p><p>Astrid&nbsp;faced TPLO surgery &ndash; a very intensive, precise surgery&nbsp;performed by an orthopedic surgeon and&nbsp;she required 16 weeks of recovery&nbsp;and additional physiotherapy.&nbsp;ARF is committed to the long term and does everything it can to help a dog or cat once rescued.

"774"	"Ann & Sandy Cross Conservation Area"	"1"	"<p>Sandy Cross, the son of A.E Cross, a well-known Albertan and one of Calgary&rsquo;s <em>Big Four, </em>lived a humble and unassuming life maintaining his family&rsquo;s land and raising cattle. It was in 1973 that Ann Abbott captured the heart of this long-time bachelor, and the two were married. In 1987, Ann and Sandy donated 2000 acres of their land to the province to become the Ann &amp; Sandy Cross Conservation Area.</p><p>At the time, it was the largest private land donation in Canadian history, and in 1996, another 2800 acres were added. It was the dream of Ann and Sandy, concerned about encroaching urban development, to ensure that their land would be protected. For 30 years, the ASCCA has been striving to be a leader and an example in land conservation and sustainability, to inspire and engage people of all ages to reflect on the importance of preserving our remaining natural habitats so that they can remain refuges for wildlife and be appreciated by future generations long after we are gone.</p><p>&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;As the CEO of the Ann &amp; Sandy Cross Conservation Area (ASCCA) I wanted to tell you about my favorite part of the day, it is when the students flood back into the building after spending the day interacting with nature, just before they get back on the school bus. In the few minutes that I speak with them I see how they&rsquo;ve been impacted by their time here. Their grins are from ear to ear and I can hardly hear as each child it trying to tell me what they learned that day. And every day I am reminded how important it is to teach our youth the importance of being outside and engaging with our environment. We provide funding for students from schools that require financial aid, and several are new Canadians, refugees or from low-income families who have not had opportunity to experience the unique natural setting of the Conservation Area. These students develop a deeper understanding of nature from which a conservation ethic may evolve. For many students&rsquo; their time at the ASCCA begins to instill in them an appreciation and enjoyment of the outdoors</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>- Greg Shyba, Ann &amp; Sandy Cross Conservation Area CEO</p>"	"public://org_profile/Sandy&Ann_0.jpg"	"Ann and Sandy Cross (credit: Bruce Masterman)"	"Ann and Sandy Cross with a backdrop of the Cross Conservation Area"	"<p>We are striving to continue the Sandy Cross&rsquo; legacy, and have made it our mission to be an example in conservation, by providing important space for wildlife, offering conservation education programs and supporting community conservation initiatives. We aspire to a day when the Conservation Area is recognized from the local to the international level as a model of sustainability, a leader in landscape-level approaches to management of protected areas and a key contributor to collaborative approaches in conservation.</p><p>The ASCCA showcases Alberta&rsquo;s beautiful natural diversity with rolling foothills and a mixture of grasslands and aspen forests. We are unique in the way that we focus on a sustainable relationship with the land. Simply more than a destination for outdoor enthusiasts and hikers, it is a place for humans and nature to connect. It is home to over 400 plant species and an abundance of wildlife, and is also the first nocturnal preserve in Canada. We have welcomed thousands of youth and adults since our education program began in 1993, and we are excited to continue delivering important and engaging programming for years to come.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>ACCOMPLISHMENTS (2016)&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In the last year, we have: &nbsp;</p><ul><li>planted well over 100,000 trees through the wonderful efforts of the Junior Forest Wardens and through our partnership with the Carbon Farmer;&nbsp;</li><li>taken steps to restore and protect the ASCCA, please take a look at our 25 Year Adaptive Management Plan which can be found <strong><a href=""http://www.crossconservation.org/sites/default/files/ASCCA_2015%20Mgmt%20Plan.pdf"">here</a></strong>;&nbsp;</li><li>begun to work on our stream monitoring program last summer; stream monitoring is one of the tools we use to determine how well we&rsquo;re protecting the conservation area;</li><li>engaged over 4300 students this year that landed on our doorstep as well as in their own schoolyards; and &nbsp;</li><li>an education highlight was a weeklong Campus Calgary program with students who were new immigrants to Canada from over ten different countries.

Natural areas like the Ann &amp; Sandy Cross Conservation Area are important refuges for thousands of species of flora and fauna. As stewards of this land, we are responsible for maintaining and protecting the habitat. Donations and fundraising ensure that we can continue to protect this land for future generations and the diverse species that call us home.</p><ul><li>Since 2014 we have partnered with <a href=""https://thecarbonfarmer.ca/"">The Carbon Farmer </a>towards our ambitious project of planting <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28mlC1KOH7U"">over 1 million trees</a>, shrubs and native grasses on select portions of the 4800 acre conservation area. We have planted over 100,000 trees in working towards this goal. Although protected from human development, much of the conservation area was once used for agriculture, and native vegetation was removed. We are now seeking to use collaborative approaches to return the ASCCA to nature.</li></ul><p>Our environmental educators carry on Sandy Cross&rsquo; passion for the land and wildlife, educating youth and adults about the integral connection we have to nature. People enjoy the ASCCA with over 20 kilometers of scenic nature trails and self-guided interpretive walks, and since 1993 over 110,000 youth and adults have participated in hands-on, conservation based learning opportunities, from <a href=""http://www.crossconservation.org/files/pdf/July-Aug.PDF"">our award-winning</a> education programs. We offer year-round community conservation learning events that aim to both educate and inspire.</p><p>With innovative and immersive education programs ASCCA takes children out of the classroom and into the outdoors, exposing them to conservation and stewardship. During the student&rsquo;s time at the ASCCA educational programs are delivered in a natural setting that promotes social awareness of environmental issues and provides first hand nature experiences. This program creates an inquiry driven environment that enhances critical-thinking, literacy, and problem-solving skills; as well as facilitating a deeper understanding of community, responsibility, cultural awareness, and stewardship. The ASCCA instills in these students a passion for the environment and the world around them. They begin to understand that they are just one piece in our eco-system and the importance of nature.</p><p style=""margin-left:.75in;""><em>&ldquo;I cannot express my gratitude enough for that extraordinary experience to learn about Aboriginals, the land, the animals, and how the environment works together.

"736"	"Antyx Community Arts Society"	"1"	"<p>Curtis was referred to an Antyx community mural project by a community youth justice committee. He had committed his first criminal offense and needed to complete a number of mandated community service hours. He was a reluctant participant at first, showing little enthusiasm and declining to participate in much of the opening dialogue and project brainstorming. It was obvious he felt he was required to be there.</p><p>As Curtis continued to put in his hours, changes began to occur. He began to help more with the project set-up and clean-up. He began to build more open connections with Antyx Staff and project artists. He began to connect socially and work cooperatively with the the other youth working on the project. Curtis invited his mother and sister to some of the mural painting sessions. He helped them paint parts of the mural and proudly showed them his work.</p><p>Once his community service hours were completed, Curtis continued to work on the mural. He was the only project participant to attend every project session. At the mural unveiling celebration he received recognition and compliments from community members thankful for the mural the youth had created. During the celebration, Curits connected with each of the Antyx staff and project artists thanking them for the opportunity help create the mural and enthusiastically volunteering for the next mural project.</p><p>Antyx uses the Arts to&nbsp;provide youth, especially youth who are marginalised,&nbsp;with the means to understand themselves, connect with others and make a positive difference in their communities.</p><p>Antyx&rsquo;s community-based art projects and programs foster critical thinking, encourages creative problem solving, promotes youth leadership and inspires collaboration. We support youth and community groups in Calgary in using the arts to address social issues that prevent youth from being safe, included and successful.</p><p>&ldquo;To put it simply, art takes flight. Each art piece, theatre creation or photo captured is a direct result of youth identifying an issue that they relate with, understand and connect with. They recognize the imbalance of power, or oppression that each belief/stereotype/myth/action/ inaction holds to their lives and the lives of people around them. Then they create a piece of art that questions, challenges and hopefully brings social change by choosing an audience that can be inspired to take action or challenged to break an unhealthy belief system.&rdquo; (Antyx Staff)</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"	"public://org_profile/mural.jpg"	""	""	"<p>Antyx Community Arts is a creatively unique organization that uses the arts as a tool to engage youth who are marginalized in their communities and mobilizes youth and community organizations in finding creative ways to address the issues that marginalize youth.</p><p><strong>Vision:&nbsp;</strong>Creative, vibrant communities fostering inclusion, participation, and potential.</p><p><strong>Mission:&nbsp;</strong>Community Arts: engaging, empowering, transforming.</p><p><strong>Values:&nbsp;</strong>We are enthusiastically committed to: Integrity, Diversity, Inclusivity, Creativity, and Empowerment</p><p><strong>History:&nbsp;</strong>Antyx was formed on January 1, 2010 when All Nations Theatre and Urban Youth Worx merged and began operating as a single community arts organization. All Nations Theatre had worked in Calgary since 1992 engaging youth in participatory theatre projects that explored issues identified by youth. Founded in 1998, Urban Youth Worx supported the development of Arts Based community development projects across Calgary.</p><p><strong>Engagement:&nbsp;</strong>The creation of Antyx has sparked tremendous opportunities to engage youth and communities in using the arts to explore critical issues and make positive change.

"102"	"Art à la Carte "	"1"	"<p>Our mom was in the palliative care unit at the Foothills Medical Centre for the last 5 weeks of her life in January/February. She had been battling cancer for the past 6 years.&nbsp; During her time at the Foothills, mom loved choosing the pictures that would be placed on her walls. One picture in particular really meant a lot to her &ndash; it was a picture of a <a href=""https://artalacarte.org/wow-moments/polar-bears/"">polar bear cub in the snow</a>. Her sister had stayed with her almost every night that she was in the hospital and she also fell in love with this polar bear picture. With Art a la Carte&#39;s permission, we purchased the picture and our mom wrote a special note on the back of the picture to give to her sister to say thank you for helping her through the last days of her time on earth. Mom gave her sister this picture two weeks before she passed away. I want to thank Art à la Carte for the impact they&#39;ve made on our family&rsquo;s lives.&nbsp;</p><p>The City&nbsp;of Calgary is well-known for its vibrant arts community; the performing arts as well as the visual arts can help Calgarians to celebrate beauty, be inspired, nurture their feelings and&nbsp;enrich their daily lives. However, this is not the case for thousands of people in our City who are long term residents in our hospitals and care centres. Recognizing that the sterile hospital environment can be forbidding, Art à la Carte was created 20 years ago to fill this aesthetic gap, bringing a compelling and unique program of art and inspiration to patients in these centres.</p><p>What began&nbsp;in 1994 with a sampling of photographs placed on the wall of a single hospital&nbsp;room has grown into a collection of 500 plus pieces of diverse art that is&nbsp;brought to the bedside of Calgary patients. More than 81,000 visits have been&nbsp;made to Calgary health care facilities by compassionate volunteers who offer&nbsp;comfort to patients, families and caregivers through the bedside art program&nbsp;which is a compelling and unique complement to patient care.&nbsp;</p>"	"public://org_profile/WhyWeExist_Image.jpg"	"Bedside volunteer engages in conversation with patient and staff."	"Bedside volunteer engages in conversation with patient and staff."	"<p>Art à la Carte&rsquo;s mission is to create powerful connections through the arts with the vision of being recognized as a leader within the Calgary healing arts community.&nbsp;</p><p>To most people hospitals and other medical settings are frightening and uncomfortable places. This was certainly true for educator, role model and humanitarian, Patti Hronek, who spent the last year of her life at the Foothills Hospital bedridden and unable to move. Patti had a rare form of bone cancer that ravaged her body beyond recognition, but it could not tarnish her indomitable spirit. When a friend offered Patti a choice of original photographs to place along the walls of her hospital room, the sterile setting was suddenly transformed into a comforting and personalized environment. Surrounded by memories, Patti was able to reconnect with the fullness of her life as she prepared to die.</p><p>Art à la Carte was established in 1994 as a tribute to Patti Hronek&rsquo;s remarkable legacy. Today, Art à la Carte has evolved as the only local nonprofit organization to use the visual arts to bring art, conversation, and joy to thousands of people in Calgary medical settings every year. Volunteers make weekly visits to the bedside of acute and palliative care patients, encouraging them to select artwork for their hospital rooms. Cancer treatment areas are also enlivened with <a href=""https://artalacarte.org/programs/skyceilings/"">virtual skylights</a>, creative murals and <a href=""https://artalacarte.org/art/beside-collection/"">pieces of art</a> in an effort to help ease the fear and stress often associated with invasive care. The <a href=""https://artalacarte.org/about-us/video/"">power of the art</a> is transformative to the patients who experience it, changing sterile and frightening places into a more homelike environment, returning a sense of dignity and autonomy to individuals during times when they are feeling vulnerable and also inspiring those who visit the residents in these care centres.</p><p>With more than 81,000 volunteer visits in the last 20 years, Art a la Carte is a master at using art to restore a sense of connection to the world beyond the hospital walls.</p>"	"public://org_profile/OurStory_Image.jpg"	"Bedside volunteers with samples of art."	"Bedside volunteers with samples of art."	"<p>Art à la Carte has created a bedside program where volunteers visit patients in acute and palliative care. Patients are invited to choose the <a href=""https://artalacarte.org/art/beside-collection/"">artwork</a> that hangs on their walls and they appreciate the opportunity to select themes that are personal and meaningful to them including landscapes, wildlife, or travel destinations. Our programs have been enthusiastically embraced by patients and hospital professionals, both of whom recognize the profound impact the program makes to the experience people have in the hospital community. Patients also report that they look forward to the friendly and<a href=""https://artalacarte.org/volunteer-in-profile/assunta-dale/""> caring volunteers</a> who bring the art - literally on a cart - to their rooms.</p><p><em>In 2013 alone, &shy;&shy;&shy;&shy;20 passionate volunteers delivered 893 hours of service and 103,444 patients experienced the power of art in healing through Art à la Carte&#39;s Art for Patients programs. This number increases exponentially with the inclusion of family members, visitors and caregivers - all of whom are equally inspired by the art.</em></p><p>Art à la Carte is the only program of its kind in Calgary. The concept and delivery is so unique that other Canadian hospitals and hospices have created similar programs based on the Art à la Carte prototype.

The &quot;<em><a href=""http://artalacarte.org/programs/create-while-you-wait/"">Create While You Wait</a>&trade;&quot;</em> program is unique to Alberta and possibly all of Canada. The guided activities are delivered by trained Art à la Carte volunteers.</p><p>Art à la Carte also brings <a href=""https://artalacarte.org/stories/410/"">inspiration</a> to the hallways and common areas of local hospitals and care centres. Cancer treatment bays at the Tom Baker Cancer Centre have been decorated with over 60 canvases. <a href=""https://artalacarte.org/programs/skyceilings/"">Virtual skylights</a> that bring the splendor of nature&#39;s artistry into imposing radiotherapy rooms bring comfort to patients who suffer from claustrophobia while an 8-panel mural by Calgary artist, Doug Driediger, creates a tranquil retreat for oncology patients and staff.

We find a place to live for people who are experiencing homelessness, food for those who are hungry, a job, a school or health-care support. Next, we help uncover why someone is in this&nbsp;situation in the first place and work with them to overcome their challenges for good.</p><p>Programs and one-on-one personalized support are designed to meet the needs of each client or program participants.</p><p>Currently, we offer:</p><h3><strong><a href=""http://www.aspenfamily.org/what-we-do/families/"">Families</a> </strong></h3><p><strong>In Home Family Support -&nbsp;</strong>When conflicts and problems exist&nbsp;at home, the safety and well-being of children can be at risk. The In-home Family Support program works to prevent, reduce or eliminate factors that may place a child or family in jeopardy.

"232"	"Autism Aspergers Friendship Society of Calgary"	"1"	"<p>The Autism Aspergers Friendship Society (AAFS) was founded in 2004 when a group of families&rsquo; saw a gap in service; their kids with Autism (ASD) were enduring stressful days; nothing but school and therapy. They were told by doctors their kids needed Recreation and Social time but these services didn&#39;t exist.&nbsp;</p><p>We asked a simple question: when did these kids get a chance to just BE Kids! &nbsp; Let me tell you about one of our members&hellip;Anton.</p><p>He was 13 when we met and was a &ldquo;high needs&rdquo; individual with Autism. Anton had little awareness of safety, limited communication, and many sensory issues which made the world a scary place; For Anton and thousands of others with Autism&hellip;the community is a place of unknown and unpredictable obstacles.</p><p>There is a misconception that individuals with Autism can&rsquo;t have or don&rsquo;t want friends and relationships...that is dead wrong! They want friendships, they want experience&hellip;they just need support in making these things possible; what&rsquo;s missing for them? Opportunity...and that&rsquo;s where AAFS come in.</p><p>Over the years, through experiential learning&hellip;places that once invoked fear and anxiety in Anton&hellip;became places of triumph. Environments once thought impossible; like the Saddledome; became places Anton could not imagine his life without.</p><p>Our mission and vision are simple&hellip;Community, Acceptance, Respect, Experience and Social Dynamics&hellip;if we provide these things, our members will be as happy as anyone, anywhere, anytime. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When we were founded in 2004&hellip;we supported 7 families &hellip;today&hellip;over 600.&nbsp;</p><p>Through a feasibility study conducted by Social Venture Partners, we have identified there are nearly 50,000 individuals with Autism living in the Alberta, a number that is rising all the time.</p><p>In November 2011, 14 year old boy with Autism won 2 tickets to a Flames game. When asked who he would like as his aide for the game&hellip;he asked if Anton could take him. That night was Anton&rsquo;s first night of many as a mentor in our Community. Anton is now 22 and is a leader and a role model in our community. He has won an Autism Community Award for leadership and is currently in the Broadcasting program at Mount Royal.</p><p>We have hundreds of story like Anton&rsquo;s and with your support&hellip;we will have thousands.</p>"	"public://org_profile/2011-12-12 11.52.02.jpg"	""	"Anton, Shawn and Jared...the first 3 members of AAFS!"	"<p>When we started in 2004, we provided 2 simple activities per week; one weeknight and one on weekends. On the weeknights, we would meet at the Autism Calgary office and rotate nights between Video Game, Board and Card Games and Art nights. On the weekends, we would do things like swimming, bowling and movies...our focus was on getting kids out together with like minded people and having some fun.</p><p>Over the years, we have significantly increased the scope and reach of our activities because our members would say things like; &quot;I want to make a movie&quot;, &quot;I want to learn how to design Video Games&quot; , &quot;I want to go to a Monster Truck Show&quot; , &quot;I want to go on a real camping trip.&quot;</p><p>So we began to do what ever it was our members asked for. It was important to us that anything we started to do was because a member of ours asked for it and that nobody else was doing it.&nbsp;</p><p>We have always operated from a very simple base; bring youth together, empower them, accept them, allow them to take risks and learn naturally whenever possible. As much as the adult world wants to &#39;structure&#39; how young people learn certain things, EVERYONE learns how they learn.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"	"public://org_profile/elscapt_0.JPG"	""	"Group of AAFS youth volunteering at the Ernie Els for Autism Golf Tournament!"	"<p><strong>AAFS Programs</strong></p><p><strong>Community Outings</strong></p><p>When AAFS began, one of our main goals was to immerse our kids in the community around us. Over the years, AAFS members have had a chance to do everything there is to do recreation wise in the Calgary area. The Community is the largest classroom in the world and AAFS takes full advantage.</p><p>A Community Outing can be anything out in the community: swimming, bowling, Flames/Hitmen/Stamps games, Laser Quest, Paintball, Sledding, Skating&hellip;. anything!</p><p><b>Clubhouse Nights</b></p><p>Club nights are evenings at the AAFS office. On Club Nights, many important lessons are learned. Turn Taking, Sportsmanship, Sharing, Hanging Out (yes we were told by one of our youth that how to just &quot;hang out&quot; was definitely a skill he needed to learn). These nights are on a more &#39;drop in&#39; basis and rotate through our schedule according to requests from our members.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are some examples of popular club night activities;</p><ul><li>Video Games</li><li>Board Games</li><li>Art Club</li><li>Cooking Club</li><li>Music Club</li><li>You Tube Club (making YouTube Videos!)</li><li>Anime Club</li><li>Comic Book Night</li><li>Movie Night (watching Movies!)</li></ul><p><b>Specialized Programs</b></p><p>AAFS Specialized Programs are programs that take place over 8- 14 weeks with a specific focus. These programs are an opportunity to engage our youth in their special interests and present an opportunity for possible future vocations.</p><p>Some examples of our specialized programs are:</p><p><strong>Movie Project</strong></p><p>12-18 youth with ASD collaborate on the writing, filming, editing, acting and everything else to do with movie making. We are just beginning AAFS Movie Project V. Over the past 4 years, our youth have taken us into a world of vampires with&nbsp;<strong>Amulet of Dracul</strong>, been sucked inside a Video Game world with&nbsp;<strong>&quot;6- The Movie&quot;</strong>, watched a group of misfits save the world from a Supersonic Fart in&nbsp;<strong>&quot;2012- A Fart Odyssey&quot;</strong>&nbsp;and watched a group of students become Super Heroes in&nbsp;<strong>&quot;The Hero&nbsp;Initiative: Unexpected Heroes&quot;&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Art in Action</strong></p><p>Arts based self-advocacy. An amazing program in which youth with ASD come together and identify various challenges they face as a community and then use the Arts to express and advocate for themselves. Art in Action is in its 8th year.</p><p><strong>Outdoor Pursuits</strong></p><p>Each year (April thru October) - we take groups of 25 youth on a number of camping trips in traditional camping style. They set up the tents, cook their own food, go fishing and hiking, light fires and do everything on must do when camping. One of our youth when asked why he enjoyed our camping trips so much said, &ldquo;Because I get to go camping. I am not going to a camp.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Buddy Club Intentional Mentorship Program</strong></p><p>An avenue for our members (youth with ASD) to start volunteering once they become comfortable enough with their social world and during this volunteer time, mentor them on what it takes to become a staff member at AAFS and eventually move them to staff. We just recently hired our 8th former &lsquo;member to come on staff. We are extremely proud of this because as much of the ASD community is trying to find ways to find people with ASD employment, very few (if any) are actually employing anyone with ASD.</p><p>The Buddy Club is a volunteer program that allows youth and young adults the opportunity to volunteer their time and help assist the Autism Aspergers Friendship Society of Calgary (AAFS) in respite activities in the community, the clubhouse, and around the office. The program receives its title from one of our oldest members who has basically grown up in AAFS and lovingly refers to staff as his buddies. The idea of being a &ldquo;buddy&rdquo; or friend to children, youth, and young adults within the autism spectrum is at the core of the volunteer program.</p><p><strong>GO Group</strong></p><p>A purely recreation/social program for adults who do not qualify for PDD funding. Once a week, participants meet up and decide on a group activity to do in the community. We run GO Group in partnership with CASS and Autism Calgary.</p><p><strong>Social Dynamics</strong></p><p>The Social Dynamics program is a partnership between Sociallogic and the Autism Aspergers Friendship Society.&nbsp;</p><p>The Social Dynamics Discovery Program is designed for individuals, ages 10 &ndash; 30 years, who may be struggling with or are looking to improve their social awareness. The Program builds upon a foundation of forming and maintaining relationships with others, fostering personal development, improving self-esteem, networking, and interacting with the world around us.</p><p>The Program will create an immersive environment, activating the 5 senses to explore the concept that the expression of human life falls along many spectrums, and that all humans are different from one another. Solidarity in uniqueness can dissolve the barriers of social inhibition, promote positive outlets for creative self-expression, and enhance the sense of community and wellbeing we feel within our everyday circles and in new social situations.</p><p><strong>The AAFS Film Club</strong></p><p>The AAFS Movie Project has been running for 5 years and a number of our members have become talented storytellers, camera operators, film editors and producers. The Film Club will give experienced members of the Movie Project the opportunity to use those skills and gain valuable work experience. The Film Club will be an avenue for them to market themselves and learn about the industry.</p><p>The AAFS Film Club can be hired out for your event, documentary or any film project.</p><p><strong>Video Game Design</strong></p><p>The course is taught and developed by a young lady with Aspergers and Tourette&rsquo;s who works in the Game Design field. Youth in the program learn the basics of Video Game Design and also have the opportunity to learn about marketing, collaborating to build a game and eventually how to sell their games.</p><p><strong>AAFS Photography Program</strong></p><p>Join AAFS at the Ability Hub to meet new people, have some fun, and learn all about the basics of photography and beyond! This specialized program is action packed with a ton of tips and tools to help you to develop your photographic eye.</p><p>At the end of the eight week course you will be asked to choose your favorite photos taken throughout the program. The group will work together to create a photo album for everyone keep and share with their family and friends.</p><p><strong>Extreme Sports</strong>- <em>Skateboarding, Parkour, Rock Climbing&hellip;</em></p><p>If you are a bit of an extremist when it comes to sports, then you will love these programs! Join AAFS and some amazing guests to learn extraordinary new skills. We offer an amazing skateboarding program, paired with our friends from Calgary Association of Skateboard Enthusiasts, to teach you some skateboarding basics, and for those more advanced some fancy tricks!</p><p>We also have a new Parkour program; which is the art of movement involving running, jumping, climbing, vaulting, rolling, flipping and much much more! The Parkour program will be facilitated through Calgary&#39;s own Breathe Parkour.</p><p><strong>Rhythm and Movement</strong></p><p>Life doesn&#39;t provide us a lot of opportunity to get in touch with our bodies through movement. So often, in school or at work we are trained to sit all day and do the same motions.</p><p>Now it is time to get out of this cycle! Come to Rhythm and Movement! A program that allows you to explore the way your body moves and find rhythm through dance, movement, yoga, meditation and music.</p><p><strong>Earn a Bike (with 2 Wheel View)</strong></p><p>Earn-A-Bike is open to bike enthusiasts ages 11 - 17 with all different backgrounds and abilities. Each week participants will come to the AAFS Clubhouse to work together to learn all about bike mechanics, teamwork and leadership. At the end of the eight week program each participant will go home having earned their very own bike lock, helmet and of course, bicycle! Yes... EVERYONE in the program gets a BIKE!</p><p><strong>Everything Art!</strong></p><p>Everything Art is an 8 week long exploration of many artistic mediums including but not limited to: painting, sculpture, tie dye, collage and much more! Whether you&#39;re an expert in the world of visual art or just trying it out, there will surely be something that you will enjoy! If there is a particular type of art or craft that you would like to learn or try out please be sure to let us know on your registration form.</p><p><strong>What&rsquo;s So Funny?</strong></p><p>An exploration into the world of humour! What is funny? Why is something funny some times and not funny other times?</p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Coming Soon!</strong></p><p>We are constantly developing new Specialized Programs, the following are in development.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What is Autism? Who am I?</strong></p><p>A program derived from Social Dynamics. Surprisingly, Individuals with ASD aren&rsquo;t given much info about ASD. This program will explore the world of Autism and the individual&rsquo;s relationship and understanding of the diagnosis.</p><p><strong>Get Off the Couch/Let&rsquo;s Get Physical</strong></p><p>A program to explore the world of physical activity and how an individual can Get Off the Couch! The overall goal of the program is to find ways to motivate individuals to Get Active and live a healthy lifestyle.</p><p><strong>Technology Programs</strong></p><p>Building on our introductory Video Game Design program, we are developing Tech Programs including everything for basic robotics to App development. We would love to host a &ldquo;Geek Camp&rdquo; in the summer of 2015 that would take advantage of dorms and students from a local trade school.</p><p><strong>Urban Arts</strong></p><p>What is Urban Art? Anything you consider Art in a Urban environment. For our first run of Urban Arts, we will focus on the elements of Hip Hop: Breakdancing, Beat Production and MCing.

We do not have staff dedicated to Fund Development, Event planning or Financial Administration (although our recent growth has dictated that we hire a Full Time Manager of Finance in early in the new year.&nbsp;</p><p>As any charitable organization, we rely on a few prongs of funding so we can run our programs; donations, grants and fund development events.&nbsp;</p><p>There are a few ways you can help out!</p><p><strong>1) Run a 3rd Party Event! </strong>Any 3rd party event can be run with a group of friends, in a workplace or within a family. Some example of 3rd party events are:</p><ul><li>Have a dress down day or a dress up day (ie- wear jeans on Fridays if you make a donation)&nbsp;</li><li>take a % or $ amount from sales on a certain day. April 2 is Autism Awareness Day...donate a portion of sales on April 2!</li><li>A family of ours just made a &quot;Haunted Yard&quot; over Halloween and asked neighbourhood kids to donate for entrance, they managed to raise over $500!</li><li>Bake Sales, Yard sales and collecting empty cans and bottles can also raise a lot of money. An 8 year old from our program has been collecting cans and bottles and has raised over $2500 in just over a year!</li><li>Suggest AAFS as beneficiary for your corporate Christmas party or Golf Tournament</li></ul><p><strong>2) Corporate Donations!</strong></p><p>Many companies will match employee donations, does yours? Even some companies who do not have a donation match &#39;policy&#39; will match when requested by employees.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3) Create a tail of giving in your community!</strong></p><p>If you are willing to make a $25 donation...that is wonderful! What if your brothers and sisters matched your $25? What if your cousins, co-workers or neighbours matched your donation?&nbsp;</p><p>Challenge friends and family to give or to volunteer!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>4) Volunteer!</strong></p><p>We have many volunteer opportunities for community members.

Here she was, surrounded by old college girlfriends and out for the first evening in over a year and she felt like she couldn&rsquo;t even keep up with the conversation. Despite having looked forward to this evening for weeks, she had hardly said a word. It felt like her once &ldquo;best friends&rdquo; hardly knew her anymore.</p><p>Michael, her 14 year old son with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) had started a meltdown just three minutes before she was supposed to leave and she had walked out the door with his screams still ringing in her ears and her guilt trailing her out the door. She just hoped that they didn&rsquo;t ask about Michael. Not tonight. It&rsquo;s not that she didn&rsquo;t love him with all her being&hellip;but she just never knew what to say. When her friends discussed their own teenage children she never knew which was worse - having them forget Michael&rsquo;s condition and leave her in awkward silence or if one of them actually remembered and they all apologetically started asking about how he was doing. Should she just smile and say he is progressing well with all his multitudes of therapy? It&rsquo;s not that he wasn&rsquo;t progressing&hellip;he was. But that didn&rsquo;t take away the truth that as her friends&rsquo; teens were out dating, playing on sports teams and learning to drive Michael may never speak. They complained about whining and cursing adolescents but she longed for nothing more than to just hear his voice&hellip;to know what was going on behind those distant brown eyes. To ask him how he felt.</p><p>----------</p><p>She had been so skeptical of the local autism mother&rsquo;s support group but Doug, her husband, had pushed her to go. Joining the Dad&rsquo;s group had brought him out of his shell so much that she thought it couldn&rsquo;t hurt to try the mother&rsquo;s group &ndash; but deep down she didn&rsquo;t even want to go inside. As she walked into the room and sat down at the big, grey plastic table she looked around in disbelief. The other mothers looked just as exhausted as she was&hellip;if not more. But yet they were chattering away comfortably with each other like old friends. Two were even laughing as they poured themselves coffee. As the support group started and the women began discussing their children, their families and themselves she felt her shoulders suddenly drop as she settled into her chair.</p><p>She could hardly believe what she was hearing&hellip;these women got it. They were talking about meltdowns, therapies, hiring and firing caregivers, the guilt of robbing your other children of the attention they so deserved, the loneliness. She bit her lip.

He&#39;s had a huge impact on us, especially on our nine-year-old son, Jason. Jason was diagnosed with autism at the age of three. He had no safety awareness and was having regular tantrums, each of which could last up to two hours. Public outings were stressful for our family, and we lived in constant anxiety that Jason may bolt (suddenly run off) out of our reach and endanger himself. When we saw a news story about Autism Support Dogs, we decided to apply.&nbsp;</p><p>When we got the call that Echo would be joining our family, we were ecstatic. Jason has always loved animals &ndash; dogs in particular. He loves cuddling them and talking to them, so when Echo became part of our family, their bond was immediate.&nbsp;</p><p>Jason has experienced many positive behavioural changes since Echo arrived. Most noticeably, his ability to express himself verbally has improved, and he talks to Echo as if they were old friends. When we are out in public and people ask us questions about Echo, Jason takes the lead to answer them. Additionally, nowadays when he becomes agitated, Jason has learned to soothe himself by hugging Echo. Even if Echo is not within close reach, Jason is now able to calm himself down by taking deep breaths and simply thinking of Echo. As parents, we take great comfort in knowing that wherever Echo is, so is Jason.&nbsp;</p><p>The bond these two have is incredible, and this year it was even more evident when we took a family vacation to Disneyland.&nbsp; We were a little nervous, but with Echo by Jason&rsquo;s side, our anxiety was put to rest. The pair did great together throughout the trip, and we were so proud of both of them!</p><p>Echo is a sweet and fun-loving dog. He loves to play with his chew toys and likes to think we like them too. Sometimes he comes up to us and teases us with them, letting us almost grab the toys and then running away with them. He also enjoys running around the backyard with the kids and going to the dog park to play with other dogs.&nbsp;</p><p>Our entire family has benefitted so much from having Echo, and we are so very grateful that he has come into our life. Not only are we all a little calmer, but Jason also has a new best friend and guardian. Although the smile on Jason&rsquo;s face when he is with Echo is priceless, we recognize the financial support, time and effort that went into training Echo for this very important job. Thank you so much to all the donors, trainers and staff who made this possible. &nbsp;</p><p>-&nbsp;<strong>Jason &amp; Echo,&nbsp;</strong>Autism Support Dog Team.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Gubbels Family</p>"	"public://org_profile/Jason and Echo.png"	"Jason and BC & Alberta Guide Dog Services Autism Support Dog Echo"	"Jason and Autism Support Dog Echo"	"<p>Imagine being able to transform someone&rsquo;s life with the gift of independence.

In essence, it means being able to experience childhood, instead of missing out.</p><p>Alberta Guide Dog Services is a division of British Columbia Guide Dog Services (a registered charity). Our mission is to meet the growing demand for professionally trained Guide Dogs and Autism Support Dogs for citizens of Alberta. Each puppy born through our in-house breeding program has the potential to grow up to change someone&#39;s life.</p><p>Although often viewed as a dog organization, BC &amp;&nbsp;Alberta Guide Dogs is actually an organization about people. When evaluating applicants&#39; suitability for Guide Dog or Autism Support Dog training, we see ability rather than disability. All&nbsp; training programs are tailored to the needs of each individual, which includes domiciliary (at-home) training in the client&rsquo;s familiar environment. While our services are provided at no cost to recipients, it takes two years and up to $35,000 to breed, raise and train one of these furry heroes-in-the-making. We are not government funded and rely on the generosity of donors, as well as special events and fundraisers, for funding.&nbsp;</p><p>To date, 110 Guide Dogs have significantly changed the lives of their owners in a myriad of ways, including safe and enhanced mobility. Thirty-three children and their families, all of whom are living with autism, are enjoying the diverse and wide-ranging benefits of an Autism Support Dog. Overall demand for our services continues to grow rapidly and our goal is to graduate 220 service dog teams by the year 2020.</p><ul><li>In honour of International Guide Dog Day, we launched our movie, <em>Birth to Retirement: Full Circle of a Guide Dog</em>.&nbsp; The movie follows a BC &amp; Alberta Guide Dogs Team, Rosamund and Guide Dog Rory and shows how our dogs are bred, raised and trained to become life-changing dogs.

At 14-16 months the puppies commence &ldquo;advanced training&rdquo; with a Guide Dog Mobility Instructor for a further 4-6 months. Around the age of two, the dog becomes certified and the pre-partnership stage begins.</p><p>o <strong>Pre-partnership consultations.</strong> Our professional mobility instructors spend time through personal one-on-one visits with each applicant to assess individual needs, limitations, and desires. This thorough process ensures that we are matching the specific individual needs of the client with the most suitable dog</p><p>o <strong>Full-time, one-on-one in-home training. </strong>Our mobility instructors work directly with clients for a minimum of two weeks upon partnering with the guide dog or autism support dog. Despite the higher cost of training clients from their home, we are committed to this model as it reduces stress for the client and dog, and increases success.</p><p>o <strong>Post-match follow-up</strong> visits at three months, then annually, and as needed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"	"public://org_profile/Luke_2015 logo_smaller size.jpg"	"Training Guide and Autism Support Dogs"	"Training Guide and Autism Support Dogs"	"<p>For almost 20 years, we have been expertly breeding and training guide dogs for blind and visually impaired individuals, and more recently support dogs for children with moderate to severe autism.</p><p>It takes an average of two years to train a guide dog or autism support dog and requires an entire team of veterinarians, staff, trainers, and volunteers.

We support the volunteers with our staff member (Puppy Training Supervisor) who holds on-going obedience classes and one-on-one visits and evaluations with them.</li><li><strong>Advanced Training:</strong> At 14-16 months of age, the puppies commence &ldquo;advanced training&rdquo; with a Certified Guide Dog Mobility Instructor for a further 4 - 6 months. Here they are taught more specific skills and are assessed as to suitability for placement with a recipient.</li><li><strong>Placement:</strong> Upon completing advanced training, the dogs are placed with a recipient. Our professional training staff faciliate full-time, one-on-one in-home training with clients for two to four weeks. Despite the higher cost of training people at their homes (travel and accommodation costs for our instructors), we are committed to this model as it reduces stress for the recipients and increases success of the team.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>After-care:</strong> Post-match follow-up visits at 3 months, then annually. We are also available as needed for questions, addressing any areas of concern or for further training.</li></ul><p>To date, we have graduated 111 Guide Dogs and 33 Autism Support Dogs. Our goal is to reduce the current two-year wait list for a professionally trained service dog. All of the service dog schools across Canada are dealing with a similar wait list.</p><p>Demand for both Guide Dogs and Autism Support Dogs continues to rapidly grow. Currently, there are 1,200 Guide Dogs working in Canada, which equates to less than 1% of blind or visually impaired people currently having a working Guide Dog. Vision loss in Canada is expected to increase by nearly 30% in the next decade.</p><p>The CDC&rsquo;s Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network estimates about 1 in 68 children have been identified with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). ASD is almost five times more common among boys (1 in 42) than among girls (1 in 189).</p><p>Our goal is to graduate 220 service dog teams by the year 2020. To this end, we have increased our breeding program substantially this year and are expanding our in-house capacity to support these dogs through our training program within the year.&nbsp;</p>"	"public://profiles/Lilly & Harry's Litter_resized.jpg"	"Breeding Guide and Autism Support Dogs"	"Breeding Guide and Autism Support Dogs"	"<p>How can you help?</p><p>You can help puppies grow up to become Guide Dogs or Autism Support Dogs &mdash; loyal, reliable partners for those who need them. But the benefits don&rsquo;t end there. Since the working life of service dogs is approximately eight to nine years, that means your support will make a difference in someone&rsquo;s life for years to come.</p><p>It costs up to $35,000 to breed, raise, train, place and provide life-long aftercare support for each Guide or Autism Support Dog that graduates. To supply more people with professionally trained Guide and Autism Support Dogs we need to increase the number of dogs in our program. In order to do this we need more funding.&nbsp;</p><p>Ways to support:</p><p><strong>1) One-time or Monthly Donations: </strong>make a tax-deductible contribution any time of year.</p><p><strong>2) Puppy Sponsorship:</strong> follow the progress of a puppy from birth to graduation with regular photos and letters.</p><ul><li><em><strong>Mom &amp; Pups Fund ($1,000 gift).&nbsp;</strong></em>Support the care of a mom and her litter.&nbsp; You will receive a birth announcement photo of mom with her pups. Then, we will match you with a puppy from that litter who, from 8 weeks of age until approximately 2 years of age, will send regular photos and letters to you.</li></ul><ul><li><em><strong>Puppy Naming ($5,000 gift).&nbsp;</strong></em>Choose a name for one of our puppies.&nbsp; You will receive a photo of your named pup.&nbsp; We will then match you with a puppy from that same litter who, from 8 weeks of age until approximately 2 years of age, will send regular photos and letters to you.</li></ul><ul><li><em><strong>Adopt a Puppy ($35,000).&nbsp;</strong></em>Support a puppy along its entire journey to potentially become a life-changing service dog. It costs up to $35,000 to breed, raise, train, place and provide life-long aftercare for each dog we graduate. You will choose a name for one of the puppies and he or she will, from 8 weeks of age until approximately 2 years of age, send regular photos and letters to you!</li></ul><p><strong>3) Bequests or Endowments: </strong>set up a gift in your will or establish an endowment in memory of a loved one.</p><p><strong>4) Life Insurance Policies:</strong> name our charity as a beneficiary; your premiums will qualify as tax-deductible contributions.</p><p><strong>5) Fundraising:</strong> organize a fundraising event or ask friends and family to donate on special occasions.</p><p><strong>6) Volunteer:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Be a Puppy Trainer.</strong> Puppies begin living with volunteers at about 8 weeks old and stay until they are 14 &ndash; 16 months of age when they start their advanced training. During this time Puppy Trainers expend time, energy and love to the puppies in order to raise puppies that are well prepared for their professional training as a service dog. Our Puppy Raising Supervisor supports Puppy Trainers and the cost of dog food, veterinary care and other basic necessities are covered. Monthly training evaluations and regular obedience classes are required as is availability during the weekdays for these sessions.</li></ul>"	"public://org_profile/DSCN1458_resized_1.jpg"	"Training Guide and Autism Support Dogs"	"Training Guide and Autism Support Dogs"	"info@albertaguidedog.com"	"https://www.facebook.com/bcandalbertaguidedogservices"	"https://twitter.com/bcguidedogs"	"www.albertaguidedog.com"	\N	"891311763RR0001"	"403.258.0819"	"info@albertaguidedog.com"	"Trish Lund"	\N	"450000"
"234"	"Beakerhead"	"2"	"<p>Those who attended Beakernight on the Stampede grounds last September were wowed by the flaming octopus, El Pulpo Mecanico. A familiar sight at Burning Man, El Pulpo made its first trip to Canada for Beakerhead 2014. It is an amazing machine: simultaneously threatening and welcoming, the product of junkyard/hoarder artists who are both serious and playful. Fearsome jets of propane flames at 2000&deg;C blast from each of El Pulpo&rsquo;s eight legs and head. Its eyes alternately bug out and retract. No beak for this cephalopod; instead a fierce mouth with fangs. El Pulpo once was a 1973 Ford F250 4&times;4, but honestly, you could study it for hours and never realize that.</p><address><em><strong>&ldquo;Kids come up to it, look really closely and see things they are totally familiar with. And they realize that they too could build something like this&mdash;yes it&rsquo;s fantastical, but practical too.&rdquo;</strong></em></address><p>At a distance it&rsquo;s a powerful flame-throwing machine, the kind of art installation that allows you to warm your hands on a cool Calgary evening. But a close-up look reveals something much stranger. El Pulpo is covered with&mdash;in fact, is constructed of&mdash;odd combinations of muffin tins, aluminum pans, forks, pie pans and kitchen utensils of all kinds. Their ordinariness is their virtue. As designer and builder Duane Flatmo says, &ldquo;Kids come up to it, look really closely and see things they are totally familiar with. And they realize that they too could build something like this&mdash;yes it&rsquo;s fantastical, but practical too.&rdquo; And Duane knows kids like that. He was one, creating mini-dinosaurs out of chicken bones atop a base of mashed potatoes and gravy at the dinner table.</p><p>The thousands who revelled in the dancing, music, engineering, technology and, yes, propane consumption in the Stampede parking lot on that Saturday night were experiencing only one&mdash;albeit the most visible&mdash;layer of Beakerhead. There was much more.</p><p>- Jay Ingram, <a href=""https://albertaviews.ab.ca/2015/01/05/sandbox-for-ingenuity/"">Excerpt from Alberta Views, January/February 2015</a></p><p>Sometimes the worlds of science and engineering, or art, can seem out of reach.

Students, especially girls, get alienated from math and science, because it does not feel socially relevant. The full potential of future leaders is trimmed.

We now serve a diverse mix of tenants at Columbus Place contributing to the strength and vibrancy of our community. BOBHA houses three broad communities; &lsquo;seniors&rsquo;, &lsquo;working poor&rsquo; and &lsquo;vulnerable&rsquo; recognizing that many tenants fit into multiple categories and that there are those in need of housing may not fit any category well. The average household income is $22,510 at Columbus Place and Principal Tenants range in age from 21 to 93 and there are three families with children under the age of 18.&nbsp;</p><p>Low Income Seniors:&nbsp; In 2016 we served 474 seniors over the age of 65 and 31 singles under the age of 65 and housed 50 new households in our seven buildings.</p><p>In Calgary there are currently 3,222 homeless individuals and 15,600 households in extreme housing need. Greater affordable housing capacity is needed to provide housing both to individuals who are currently homeless and to help those in extreme housing need.&nbsp;</p><p>Since its inception in 1975, BOBHA has been providing affordable housing to those seniors most in need throughout the city of Calgary. BOBHA recognizes that the need for affordable housing stretches across our community and that seniors, those who are working full-time and those on social assistance can all struggle to pay market rents. In 2014, BOBHA opened Columbus Place in Bridgeland and opened its doors to low-income families, seniors and others in need of affordable housing. Fostering an inter-generational community wherein low-income seniors live next to families and vulnerable individuals promotes a strong and diverse community for our tenants.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Bishop O&rsquo;Byrne Housing Association is a proud Partner in the </strong><strong>RESOLVE</strong><strong> Campaign</strong></p><p>Making Calgary a better home for everyone.</p><p><a href=""http://www.resolvecampaign.com/"">www.resolvecampaign.com</a></p>"	"public://org_profile/valencia family ckc.jpg"	"Our First Family"	"The First BOBHA Family"	"<p>BOBHA partners with community groups to promote social connections and access to community resources amongst our tenant.&nbsp;</p><p>Here at BOBHA we recognize that no matter which community you live in, it is our responsibility to provide excellent housing and support to those in need of those services.</p><p>Our Mission is to:</p><ul><li><em>Provide and operate non-profit residential accommodation and incidental facilities exclusively for senior citizens primarily of low or modest income and for persons of low income in the greater Calgary area.</em></li><li><em>Provide the necessary supports to relieve isolation and loneliness and to assist tenants to live independently in a healthy and safe environment.</em></li></ul><p>Our Vision is to:</p><ul><li><em>Develop and construct more housing for our senior citizens that are in the greatest need, as we endeavor to provide the tools necessary for our tenants to have a positive aging experience.

It supplies water to our cities and towns, irrigates farmlands, powers hydroelectric generators and creates endless opportunities for recreation.

As a result, the Bow is no longer available for further water allocation in the future.</p><p>It underscores the need for cooperation and collaboration in a sustained response.

It didn&#39;t help that Deanna&#39;s self-confidence was at an all-time low.</p><p>But, her future was hardly predetermined. Inspired by a neighbor &ndash; a fellow single parent &ndash; who had decided to go back to school and was considering Bow Valley College (BVC) because of the financial supports for student-parents, Deanna enrolled in BVC&#39;s academic upgrading program &ndash; step one to completing her high school diploma. Managing classes, daycare scheduling and studying with a toddler at home wasn&#39;t easy, but compared to juggling jobs, for Deanna returning to learning was empowering!</p><p>She was a strong student and her results, and subsequent awards, boosted her self-confidence. Strength and perseverance also came from the encouragement and tutoring support of Deanna&#39;s BVC instructors. Their unshakeable commitment to her success and belief in her, helped restore her belief in herself, and made her unstoppable.</p><p>Deanna followed up her BVC academic upgrading with a chemical engineering technology diploma from SAIT, then later, a chemical engineering degree from Lakehead University. So when she says that her return to learning cultivated a commitment to continuous learning, she means it.</p><p>Deanna&#39;s life-changing academic journey also elevated her resiliency and resourcefulness - strengths that now, through the Indigenous Speakers Bureau and other mentoring platforms, she strives to help others develop, especially Aboriginal youth and women.

He could amputate Blake&#39;s leg for about $200 or we could spend $5,000 to have his hip repaired.</p><p>Our organization was less than one year old at the time and we had no contingencies for exceptional veterinary costs. We had established our organization as a no kill, and no cage adoption center, but until this &ldquo;moment of truth&rdquo; we had not considered the implications of those values and promises. The decision about Blake, made us confront ourselves about those values. </p><p>The choice was between saving money with the result being a one year old, three legged dog, versus spending money we did not have with the result being a young healthy, four-legged dog.</p><p>We decided that quality of life was more important than saving money and that we would find a way to manage the costs.&nbsp; This choice has informed our all of our subsequent decision making with regard to health.&nbsp; In essence, we want the best health care possible for dogs and cats in our care and treat them as if they are members of our family. </p><p>Blake showed us what it really means to be a no cage, no kill shelter. </p><p>As it turns out, we made a very wise investment. Blake went on to become a certified avalanche rescue dog. He even served at the Para-Olympics in British Columbia. Now retired, Blake still comes to the Bow Valley SPCA on a regular basis to work with the dogs that need a calm canine friend. </p><p>Blake has taught us what is means to &quot;Pay it forward&rdquo;. </p>"	"public://org_profile/BlakeJoseph Shoot-378_0.jpg"	""	""	"<p>The Carla Cumming Sojonky Adoption Centre, home of the Bow Valley SPCA, is Canada&#39;s first no kill, no cage adoption centre. For 10 years we have provided the best possible care for abandoned dogs and cats in the Bow Valley. Each animal in our care lives in a room, is treated as an individual, and is kept until matched to its &quot;forever family&quot;. Our costs are higher, but so is our &quot;save rate&quot; which is over 98%.</p><p><strong>Our No Kill, No Cage Philosophy</strong></p><p>Our animals are housed in rooms (not kennels or cages) and we are committed to keeping and caring for every one of these dogs and cats until they find their forever family. Adoption is our goal, but in cases where finding a match is difficult, we are committed to keeping the dog or cat in our care until there is a match.&nbsp; As a no kill adoption center, we are committed to training and rehabilitating all of our residents until they can be successfully adopted and, if necessary, to provide a lifetime sanctuary for dogs or cats that cannot be adopted. The quality of life, while the dogs and cats are being rehabilitated is a critical issue. The &ldquo;no cage&rdquo; concept is an essential part of the emphasis we put on our residents having the highest quality of life possible&mdash;and we know it works.</p><p><strong>Our Facility - The Carla Cumming Adoption Centre&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Named in honor of Frank Sojonky&rsquo;s wife, the Carla Cumming Sojonky Adoption Centre is a 3,500 square foot building with a <em>large off-leash park, wooded walking trails, and a secure fence line</em>. The Centre opened in June 2007 and was recognized by Natural Resources Canada as energy efficient in design. Green buildings are of higher quality, last longer, and cost less to operate; the long-term financial savings are significant, especially for a non-profit organization where every dollar matters. We are proud that our building is a home that respects the health and well being of both its occupants and the environment, while creating an excellent model for future adoption centres across the country.</p><p><strong>Since 2008, we have:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Saved over 1,300 dogs and cats</strong>, with our save rates being 99% for dogs and 98% for cats.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Matched 99% of our animals with forever homes.&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><ul><li>Helped re-home dogs and cats from surrounding adoption centres, which has strengthened relationships between other rescue organizations and moving us towards a no-kill nation.</li></ul><ul><li>Provided a low-cost spay/neuter program to support low-income families in the Bow Valley.</li></ul><ul><li><p>Provided educational outreach emphasizing responsible pet ownership and the importance of neutering pets which has reached hundreds of school children and adults.</p></li><li><p>Sponsored a number of fundraising events that have enjoyed broad and consistent community support.</p></li><li><p>Partnered with other community groups such as Wild Smart, Pats for Pets, First Responders, and several local businesses to promote animal welfare.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Our 2016 Results:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li><p>Between 100 and 200 people visited our adoption centre every week looking at and interacting with adoptable dogs and cats.</p></li><li><p>Over 33,000 people visited our web site in 2016.

Families with an extra bedroom are contracted to provide shelter to youth in their homes for various lengths of time. Safe Couch families are provided funding to defer the costs of having a youth stay in their home, as well as a respite worker or a respite home when breaks or holidays are needed. Each Safe Couch family will provide meals, a safe and healthy place to live and help guide the self-directed path of each youth with the support of community resources.</p><p>During this time of stability, each youth will work with the Youth Housing Liaison and community agencies on a self-directed plan. This plan is youth driven and may include any of the following: family re-integration, completing school, full or part-time employment, drug and alcohol counselling, mental health support, communication skills or career readiness.</p><p>The program is currently funded by the Government of Canada Homelessness Parterning Strategy and by Alberta Human Services. This funding supports one operating Safe Couch family and the ability to support respite care for this family.

She was harming herself in the form of cutting, was dating a drug dealer twice her age, and never went home because her relationship with her mother was strained and dysfunctional. She sank into depression over how hopeless her life was, but somewhere deep inside she realized she wasn&rsquo;t ready to give up on herself.</p><p>Jo searched for hope and found Boys and Girls Clubs of Calgary&rsquo;s Hera program for girls experiencing or at risk of sexual exploitation. She explains, &quot;<em>I signed up with the intention of being able to finish school, but ended up getting so much more. Before Hera, I never felt safe enough to admit when I wasn&rsquo;t okay. I buried my pain to try and protect myself. At Hera, I decided I wanted to be a strong, nurturing person who does good in the world.&quot;</em></p><p>Hera&rsquo;s holistic approach to wellness taught Jo how to take care of herself, give back to her community, and make positive life choices. Thanks to Hera, Jo was also introduced to Haven&rsquo;s Way, BGCC&rsquo;s youth housing program for young women, where she was embraced as part of the Haven&rsquo;s Way family. &quot;<em>I made friends, I learned to cry, laugh, love and trust. I am so grateful for what I have, and I owe so much of that gratitude to Boys and Girls Clubs of Calgary. I hope that everyone can see the value in kids that seem beyond reach or troubled, because there is something there worth saving.&quot;&nbsp;</em></p><p>Although Jo has completed high school, is working now, and has moved out of Haven&#39;s Way... you can still find her there giving back, spending time with the girls and staff, doing the simple things we sometimes take for granted like carving pumpkins or just hanging out together.

"813"	"Branch Out Neurological Foundation"	"2"	"<p class=""p2"">Back in 2005, only months after learning I was an early hopeful for the&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.olympic.org/vancouver-2010-winter-olympics"" target=""_blank"">2010 Olympics</a>&nbsp;speed skating team, I received another piece of news that would change my life forever.&nbsp;</p><p class=""p2"">At 19 years old, I was&nbsp;diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, a degenerative neurological disorder with no cure. I was also told I would probably never speed skate again.&nbsp;</p><p class=""p2"">With that determination of an elite athlete, invincible teenage mindset and after several months of therapy, I found the strength to tie up my skates and start competing again. Although I could skate again, I had another major relapse&nbsp;in 2006 and again in 2009 when I was told my disease was progressing and I would become wheelchair bound in the coming years. After receiving this news and trying 5 years of drug therapies with harsh side effects and little&nbsp;to no impact on my disease, I decided to take a different, more natural approach by going off of my drug therapy and focusing on nutrition, herbal medicine, massage and other integrative approaches towards rebalancing my nervous system.&nbsp;</p><p class=""p2"">Not only did I feel better, but it made sense to me. 8 months after I went went off my drugs I came 6 spots off the Canadian Olympic team and 8 years later I am thriving with health, and am relapse/symptom free!</p><p class=""p2"">Throughout my personal journey, a few gaps became clear to me: a lack of high-quality research, credibility and funding for some of the more natural approaches to healing the nervous system.</p><p class=""p2"">To address these gaps, I, along with co-founder Graham Daw, started the&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.branchoutfoundation.com/"" target=""_blank"">Branch Out Neurological Foundation</a>&nbsp;in 2010 to literally &#39;Branch Out&#39; and establish a new and now emerging field of research termed <strong>neuroCAM</strong> (neuroscience + complementary and alternative modalities).&nbsp;</p><p class=""p2"">Myself along with 100+ dedicated volunteers raise money through fundraising events such as the Branch Out Bike Tour and Snowshoe Tour. We have been attracting new donors and sponsors and partner with businesses who are all eager to join our legacy to establish <strong>Calgary as a world renowned center for neuroCAM research.</strong></p><p class=""p2"">This past June, the foundation hit its second million-dollar fundraising milestone. NeuroCAM is now an emerging field of research across western Canada with 50+ groundbreaking neuroCAM research projects underway.

MacMaster, University of Calgary</p><p>One in nine Canadians aged 15 to 24 suffers from depression&mdash;this is the highest rate of depression in any age group. Depression has negative impacts at home, at school, with friends and with family, and the impacts can be felt for decades. Unfortunately, front line treatments only work in about half of youth, leaving many ill and vulnerable to suicide&mdash;the second leading cause of death in this age group. Depression threatens their very lives. With funding from Branch Out, Frank MacMaster&rsquo;s lab pioneered the use of magetic brain stimulation (TMS) to fight depression in youth. This novel technology offers new hope for those who are suffering and Dr. MacMasters work has helped spearhead efforts to bring brain stimulation to Alberta as a clinical service.</p><p><em>&ldquo;Brain stimulation truly saved my life.

For many people living with Parkinson&rsquo;s, the disease can not only dramatically affect their gait (the way they walk), but deter them from participating in social activity and physical exercise. Hu&rsquo;s research discovered that brain circuits for music perceptions can help initiate and control a movement response. To use the app, patients strap the motion sensors to their leg and use the device to produce signals with their body movements that can turn music on or off. Freezing and shuffling steps stop the music from playing. After each walk, the app automatically sends the data to researchers who can remotely customize the program settings to ensure patients can walk safely with optimal outcomes.

"239"	"Brenda Strafford Society for the Prevention of Domestic Violence"	"2"	"<p>Betty was first referred to The Brenda Strafford Society for the Prevention of Domestic Violence&rsquo;s Second-Stage Shelter program by a Social Worker at Alberta Health Services. She was fleeing an abusive husband and&nbsp;roommate who had addiction issues&nbsp;while having the added concern of having physical mobility issues. The Centre provided her a safe place to stay while she received support for her trauma and assistance for her basic needs from compassionate staff and dedicated community partners. Her stay in one of the Centre&rsquo;s shelter apartments, which is typically for a 6 month duration, was extended due to the housing issues that are occurring in Calgary as a growing city. During her stay at the Centre, Betty attended both individual and group counselling and learned to set goals and boundaries. She frequently commented how thankful she was for the friendliness of the staff and the security of the building. Betty became a stronger, more independent person and realized she was not alone. Betty told her Counsellor, &ldquo;I now know that I am a strong person who can say no, without feeling bad about it. Because I have respect for myself, I [am] given respect back.&rdquo; Betty now has since&nbsp;secured permanent housing for people who have physical mobility issues.</p><p>Jane registered for follow-up services after completing The Brenda Strafford Society for the Prevention of Domestic Violence&rsquo;s Second-Stage Shelter program. Jane, who appeared to be suffering from the effects of trauma, began counselling with no goals and little hope for the future. Over the course of one year, Jane, with the assistance of the Follow-up/Outreach Counsellor, slowly worked through her trauma, learned to cope with the trauma of past abusive experiences, and eventually expressed a desire to create a better life for both herself and her seven year old son. She created a number of goals for herself, including goals of emotional well-being and financial independence. With support from her counsellor, she was able to learn strategies to enhance her well-being, as well as be connected to appropriate community resources to assist with financial planning, and employment. Eventually Jane found full time work and now resides in her own residence, with an improved sense of self-esteem and confidence.</p>"	"public://org_profile/Capture2.JPG"	"Brenda Strafford Society"	"Brenda Strafford Society Logo"	"<p>The Brenda Strafford Society for the Prevention of Domestic Violence, which we also call the Centre, is made up of 34 second-stage apartments;&nbsp;our families can stay for up to 6 months while receiving&nbsp;individualized counselling and parenting support.

Many of our current invitations are with First Nations communities in the Treaty 7 area.</p><p>First Nations youth in Calgary are struggling to create meaningful futures for themselves and their communities. While there are many offerings of programs that target First Nations youth, these existing programs encounter challenges with engagement of youth, and follow through by youth participants in pursuing their career and/or academic goals. Canada Bridges believes that the need for First Nations youth is not another pre-employment program offering, but rather a broader need for coordination, collaboration, youth engagement and ongoing mentorship that Bridges has the expertise and opportunity to fill. Our support includes intentional and active youth engagement, programming co-design and delivery, and long-term mentorship for youth and young adults post-program to support individuals as they navigate their way to school, a career or meaningful work, or community involvement.</p>"	"public://org_profile/8162457047_3c88bf442b_z_0.jpg"	"Unveiling Youth Potential Workshop"	"Lindsay at an UYP Worshop"	"<p><strong>What is Unveiling Youth Potential?</strong></p><p><strong><a href=""http://canadabridges.com/programming/unveiling-youth-potential/"">Unveiling Youth Potential (UYP)</a> </strong>is a youth empowerment program aimed at realizing the potential of youth and young adults by supporting their leadership roles in building strong, resilient communities. This program was developed out of our beliefs that positive social change is necessary for the world to progress in a way that is healthy and vibrant; and that youth and young adults represent the group that offers the greatest hope for this change as they go beyond societal, cultural, governmental and institutional barriers to enliven the wisdom of communities around the world. Furthermore, we believe that youth and young adults desire positive social change . . . in fact, their future may depend on it.</p><p><strong>What is Included in Unveiling Youth Potential?</strong></p><p>UYP is an approach to youth leadership training and development, during which the following components are integrated:</p><ul><li><a href=""http://canadabridges.com/programming/unveiling-youth-potential/wisdom-stories/""><strong><em>Wisdom Stories</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;answer the question of WHY you want to inspire change.</em>&nbsp;What is it that youth participants are passionate about, and what motivates them? What is it that makes them believe they are the right individuals to lead change?</li><li><a href=""http://canadabridges.com/programming/unveiling-youth-potential/community-mapping/""><strong><em>Community Mapping</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;answers the question of WHERE you are going to inspire change.&nbsp;</em>Participants may choose to focus on any community that they belong to, but they will be most influential in a community they deeply care about.</li><li><a href=""http://canadabridges.com/programming/unveiling-youth-potential/change-leadership/""><strong><em>Change Leadership</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;answers the question of HOW you are going to inspire change.&nbsp;</em>Unveiling Youth Potential introduces a leadership strategy called &ldquo;Gentle Action&rdquo;, adapted from a book of the same name by David F. Peat. Gentle action is all about introducing small changes that are sensitive, relevant, and culturally-aware.</li><li><a href=""http://canadabridges.com/programming/social-entrepreneurship-training/""><strong><em>Social Entrepreneurship</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;answers the question of WHAT you are going to do to inspire change.</em>&nbsp;Unveiling Youth Potential teaches social entrepreneurship from a perspective of compassion. The goal is that youth participants would see themselves differently in relation to the world around them &ndash; that they would feel empowered to respond to social issues.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What are the Goals of Unveiling Youth Potential?</strong></p><p>Bridges Social Development aims to empower youth to be agents of change by supporting the development of capacities necessary to respond to the conditions of their environment and meet situational challenges. Through the UYP program, Bridges Social Development supports empowerment by inviting youth participants to reflect on themselves and their communities &ndash; and the connectedness between the two &ndash; and then take action by responding to community needs or priorities. This process sustains the practice of praxis, develops critical consciousness and social competency to unveil, build, and sustain youth potential and capacity. Youth become agents of change as they start to take action, engaging within their communities whether by just simply being kind to others, being a better neighbour, daughter, son, mother, father, sibling, or by initiating a social change project. Developing the capacity to engage with life&rsquo;s challenges and subsequently take action are crucial pieces of learning, and Bridges Social Development believes that every youth has this potential: to lead and/or support social change. Through this approach,&nbsp;<em><strong>the building of individual empowerment will result in the realization of healthy and vibrant communities.</strong></em></p>"	"public://profiles/6. map copy.jpg"	"Youth Community Mapping"	"Community Mapping "	"<p><strong>Become a Mentor: </strong></p><p>Bridges&#39; empowers people by building their capacity and unveiling their potential. Our programming is one piece of this, but an equally important piece is the role that caring adults play in the communities where young people live and work. These caring adults become fellow life journeyers, and &lsquo;lifters&rsquo; who support, encourage, and believe in youth participants of our work.

She looked forward to a summer of fun, exploring her new surroundings, meeting neighbours and making new friends.</p><p>However, as a child with a disability&hellip; the desire to meet people and try new things came with its own challenges.</p><p>Julia&rsquo;s family relocated in search of better opportunities. Her parents&rsquo; immediate focus was providing for their family and Julia&rsquo;s recreation activities did not take priority. &nbsp;They had received almost no social or financial support while adapting to their new environment, which put a severe strain on her family.</p><p>Julia was facing the possibility of spending her entire summer without opportunities to interact with others.</p><p>No outings. No friends.</p><p>That&rsquo;s where Between Friends came in... and changed <em>EVERYTHING.</em></p><p>This summer, Julia was able to attend <strong>Between Friends </strong><strong>Camp Bonaventure</strong> for the first time, which had a profound impact on her life.</p><p>Because of Between Friends and generous donors like you, Julia was able to just be a kid... and most importantly, feel accepted.</p><p>She had finally found a place to belong.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>*name changed&nbsp;</em></p>"	"public://org_profile/CBFC Parachute 2015-07-23 Brightened.jpg"	"Kids flinging a brightly coloured parachute at camp"	"We celebrate ability and focus on the possibility of achievement!"	"<p>Recently parents and caregivers from across the country were surveyed about their children with disabilities to determine the health, well-being and social inclusion of children, youth and their parents.&nbsp;When asked about the quality and number of friendships their child had, parents reported that &ldquo;one-third of the children have no friends even at school and over half the children have no friends outside of school.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>NO FRIENDS.</p><p>Now imagine that you have a place to go where you are welcomed, where your interests are considered and you experience fun and friendship. Imagine the surprise when you master something that you weren&rsquo;t sure you could do and others cheer you on while you do it.</p><p>That&rsquo;s what Between Friends is all about &ndash; a place to connect, a place to grow, a place to belong.

We operate more than 130 programs in five program areas. We encourage inclusive program participation by offering program spaces for those who do not have a disability. Our vision is one of inclusion so that there are no barriers to participation within Between Friends and within the wider community.</p><p>We are most proud of the work that we do with the community to educate them about including people with disabilities, so that they may participate alongside their typically developing peers. Ah, for society to be inclusive&hellip;now wouldn&rsquo;t that be something special.</p><p>We are also proud of the young leaders that we develop. Through our programs, our leaders and volunteers not only learn leadership skills, but they learn how to be accepting of others who may be just a bit different. We focus on ability rather than disability and we focus on similarities rather than differences. Our leaders grow and develop into teachers, speech language pathologists, doctors, psychologists, occupational and physiotherapists&hellip;and some of them even enter the oil patch!</p><p>The greatest accomplishment we can have is to have our participants develop their skills to the point that they can volunteer and even work for us&hellip;and we have a thriving Volunteer in Training program and a service club for adults with disabilities, where they can show off their skills and give back to others in the way that others have given to them all of their lives.</p>"	"public://org_profile/CBFC Impact2015 Snip Because.JPG"	"Three campers embrace in grateful hug"	"I became aware of the simple joys in life - and for that, I'm grateful"	"<p>Each program area can be considered a stepping stone for participants to develop more experience in connecting, growing and belonging.</p><ol><li><strong>Between Friends Camp Bonaventure:&nbsp; </strong>a true summer outdoor day camp at Riveredge Park where friendship and fun flourish for ages 4 to 17.</li><li><strong>Between Friends W.E.S.O.A.R!:</strong>&nbsp; a variety of social and recreational group activities like bowling, swimming, movie nights and dancing for all ages.</li><li><strong>Between Friends Camp Fun&rsquo;zAmust:&nbsp;</strong> a unique residential outdoor camp, run in partnership with Easter Seals Camp Horizon, adapted and accessible for ages 7 to 17 &amp; 18 to 40.</li><li><strong>Between Friends Adventurers:&nbsp;</strong> a summer program for adults aged 18 and older that is customized to varied interests from city tours to mountain retreats.</li><li><strong>Between Friends I.C.A.N!:&nbsp;</strong> a program that promotes social inclusion by having persons with disabilities participate in community programs or camps with their typically developing peers at partner agencies such as the YMCA or Airdrie Genesis.&nbsp; Any private studio can also be an I.C.A.N.! experience.</li></ol><ul><li><strong><a href=""http://betweenfriends.ab.ca/programs/"">http://betweenfriends.ab.ca/programs/</a></strong></li></ul><p>The outcomes that we expect are that participants will make positive choices toward healthier lifestyles and have positive social interactions with personnel and other participants.

"196"	"Calgary Bridge Foundation for Youth"	"3"	"<p>In 2013, we helped 11,528 immigrant youth and adults successfully integrate into Calgary. One of those individuals was Adel* and this is his story:</p><p>It was a warm sunny day in Iraq. Adel heard gun shots followed by screaming and panic. He ran out to find his mother, father and sister laying on the streets. His little sister died in his arms. It was the day he lost three family members due to rebel attacks on innocent civilians. Tears, anger, grief and shock overwhelmed this young teenager as he lay on the streets holding his family and crying. Nothing made any sense to this young boy and from that day forward, he knew his life had forever changed.</p><p>When Adel arrived in Canada as a refugee, he was nervous and afraid. All he knew in English was how to say his name. His teachers saw him as a teen with &ldquo;behavioural issues.&rdquo; After a year in our programs, this young boy overcame his fears and went from being shy, lonely and confused to a confident, popular student. He has even won a scholarship and his teachers now see him as an &ldquo;ambassador for the school.&rdquo;</p><p>Our programs improved his social skills and emotional well-being. We taught him the importance of helping those in need and he signed up as a mentor to immigrant youth who struggled like he once did. Today Adel wants to pursue an engineering degree because he believes &ldquo;education is the key to ending violence and staying positive in life.&rdquo; He feels he can accomplish this because of us.&nbsp;</p><p>We help thousands like Adel each day. We also help their families. Some come from economically disadvantaged backgrounds while some are average folks that need a firm foundation so they can realize their potential and strat contributing to Canadian society shortly after arriving to Calgary.</p><p>*The young boy&#39;s name has been changed to protect his privacy.</p><p>OUTCOMES&nbsp;</p><ul><li>We are the only immigrant serving agency with a daily presence in the public and Catholic school board reception centers thus making it easy to access our services.</li><li>In 2013, we trained 60 youth to volunteer as peer mentors to newcomers in their schools.</li><li>We delivered over 2000 hours of free academic support to help struggling students improve their grades and graduate from high-school.</li><li>Our multi-lingual team can deliver support in over 20 languages.</li><li>100% of teachers surveyed reported a significant increase in newcomer engagement and involvement at school after students spent three months in our Mentorship Program.</li><li>100% of youth in our Afterschool Program reported greater personal motivation and imporvement in their leadership and self-confidence.</li><li>We deliver over 100 workshops on topics like employment, housing, banking, health care, child care and safety.</li><li>We partner with over 40 community agencies to offer referrals for housing, employment, food, shelter, clothing and other services.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>"	"public://org_profile/ElementaryKids.png"	"Building an inclusive Calgary"	"From newcomers to new friends...helping kids find a sense of belonging"	"<p>We empower thousands of immigrant and newcomer youth and help them overcome emotional, cultural and socio-economic barriers.

Through a partnership with over 40 community agencies and both - the public and Catholic school board, we deliver support in schools, libraries or housing complexes with the highest need. We teach kids about adaptability, anti-bullying, self-empowerment, healthy friendships and positive behaviours.

Youth are exposed to local culture and norms as they make friends and get matched with mentors.</p><p>FAMILY SUPPORT |&nbsp;When a family arrives to a new country they face a series of challenges. Everything from employment, learning English, or understanding health, transportation, banking and school systems can be daunting.

We create individualized plans to help the entire family successfully settle into the community.&nbsp;</p><p>SUMMER SUPPORT |&nbsp;Summer is a time for fun but it can be hard to find fun things to do if you&rsquo;re new to the country.

When&nbsp;he took them on their first trip to the Rockies, one of them commented, &ldquo;T<em>his is so beautiful; I am so proud to be Canadian.</em>&rdquo; Since 1985, Don has been hosting Christmas Day dinner at his home for those he&nbsp;has hosted or sponsored. 50 &ndash; 60 people attend each year.</p><p>Starting in 1991, Don also helped a shy young man sponsor his parents and four&nbsp;brothers. This family has expanded to 17 members and has become a miniature&nbsp;United Nations with spouses from the Czech Republic, Jamaica, Philippines, Iran and&nbsp;Korea. At the marriage of the youngest brother, Don was honored to be seated at the family table and was introduced to the&nbsp;reception attendees with the phrase: &ldquo;<em>If it wasn&rsquo;t for Don, I wouldn&rsquo;t be here</em>.&rdquo;</p><p>There are many that have been so touched with Don&rsquo;s passion and sincerity that they have named their children after Don&rsquo;s<br />parents, and refer to him as &lsquo;<em>My father in Canada</em>&rsquo;.</p><p>Don has been involved with many initiatives including hosting weekly social nights, offering temporary accommodations in&nbsp;his home for refugees, sponsoring refugees, helping to prepare refugee claims, filing taxes for newcomers, and conducting tax&nbsp;workshops, amongst others.</p><p><strong>THERE ARE 3 WAYS YOU CAN HELP:</strong></p><p><strong>YOU CAN VOLUNTEER</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;These are some of our programs seeking volunteers:</p><ol><li><strong><a href=""https://www.ccisab.ca/community/community-connections-for-newcomers"" target=""_blank"">Community Connections for Newcomers</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=""https://www.ccisab.ca/youth-teens/immigrant-youth-outreach-project"" target=""_blank"">Immigrant Youth Outreach Project (IYOP)</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=""https://www.ccisab.ca/refugees/refugee-child-enhanced-integration-project"" target=""_blank"">Refugee Child Enhanced Integration Project&nbsp;</a></strong><p style=""display: inline !important;""><strong><strong style=""color: rgb(71, 71, 71);""><a href=""https://www.ccisab.ca/refugees/refugee-child-enhanced-integration-project"" target=""_blank"">(RCEIP)</a></strong></strong></p></li></ol><p><strong>YOU CAN CONNECT WITH US </strong>-&nbsp;A city-wide structure was required to prepare for an increased number of refugee arrivals, specifically those from Syria via Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon.

The interviewees themselves were also deeply impacted through our deep listening.

With little to no help from her husband, Ms. C worked very hard for the family and also paid off the debts that her husband had accumulated. The relationship between Ms. C and her husband finally broke apart.</p><p>In 2000, Ms. C was diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder and had to receive treatment. In 2005, she decided to move to Calgary. It was tough starting off fresh into another country, she had trouble adapting to the new environment, she had a language barrier and was financially strapped. Encountering all these difficulties, she became depressed again and she suffered insomnia. Worse still, her doctor had told her that her spinal cord was compressed and that her 4th vertebrae had shifted.&nbsp;</p><p>The physical and mental suffering brought her into deep despair, the feeling of being hopeless and helpless overcame her. One day as she was wandering on the street, trying to kill time, she shoplifted in a store and was caught and immediately handed over to the authorities. Actually, she was mentally incapable of making sound judgements, she could not tell right from wrong and she had no idea what she was doing.</p><p>Guilt, shame and regret hit her and that&rsquo;s when she turned to the Calgary Chinese Community Service Association (CCCSA) for help. Through the legal clinic which was held in partnership between CCCSA and Calgary Legal Guidance, a volunteer lawyer explain to her about her situation and give her guidance on the steps she needed to take. CCCSA staff gave Ms. C. a lot of support including accompanying her to the court appearance and helping her with the necessary procedures to enter the Mental Health Diversion Program, where Ms. C went through a four month program offered by Alberta Health Services. Ms. C successfully completed the program, her charges were withdrawn and her mental conditions were properly dealt with. Now, smiles reappeared on her face and she has turned a new page in her life.</p><p>To this day, Ms. C &nbsp;is thankful to everyone who helped her throughout her life and is grateful to have to stepped foot in CCCSA.</p><p>&quot;<em>I want to thank CCCSA for getting me through this experience and would suggest that all who needs help or wants to volunteer call CCCSA.</em>&quot;</p><p><strong>Our Impact: a few client indicators...</strong></p><p>Last year, our front desk served 2,763 clients and a total of 5,327 clients received CCCSA services.

"506"	"Calgary Counselling Centre"	"3"	"<p>My depression started when I experienced a lack of support and respect at my workplace. Each day was mentally exhausting and consisted of constant negativity, but I forced myself to go to work everyday. I began to feel worthless and alone; I was surrounded by people, yet isolated in my own thoughts. My pessimistic thoughts consumed me. I felt that no one understood me, and gradually lost contact with friends and family. I started to dread attending events, which usually gave me comfort. Things that I loved doing before, such as teaching, I no longer liked or had the will to do it. I started questioning my purpose in life, what was the point of it all? Soon after, I started contemplating suicide.</p><p>I almost lost everything to depression. I often walked by overpasses and thought about how easy it would be to end it. I would hear about suicides on the radio, and thought to myself that I had to keep quiet about my feelings. I attempted suicide two times.</p><p>My attempts to end my life were not successful. And after the second attempt I found the strength and courage to seek help. I found solace speaking about my feelings to someone who understood.</p><p>I was comfortable talking with my counsellor and felt that I could trust her. She was there to make me feel better and get me better.</p><p>I had a particularly bad day at work one day and called her, she told me to come in first thing in the morning. I honestly think she saved my life that day.</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; David</p>"	"public://org_profile/Slide1.JPG"	"Calgary Counselling Centre logo"	"Calgary Counselling Centre logo"	"<p><strong>Lives change here. </strong>Calgary Counselling Centre helps individuals, couples, parents, families, and youth by providing counselling and group programs in such areas as depression, domestic abuse, relationships, children and youth mental health, eating disorders amongst others.</p><p>We offer sliding-scale payments, meaning our clients pay what they can.

FIT tracks the progress of our clients at each session through the use of a questionnaire and allows us to adjust treatment as needed based on the results.</p><p>Why do we make our clients fill out questionnaires at every session and why we dedicate the time to analyze and monitor these questionnaire responses? For the same reason your physician monitors your vital signs. Think of FIT as your emotional vital signs.

"686"	"Calgary Fetal Alcohol Network: An Alberta Society"	"3"	"<p><strong>Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) is the most common developmental disorder in Canada.</strong> It is permanent, complex, most often invisible and is one of the most stigmatised and misunderstood disorders in our society. They are among the most vulnerable, but people with FASD also have many strengths: with the right knowledge and support within their communities, individuals with FASD can lead healthy, fulfilling lives.</p><p>FASD is a result of brain injury incurred by a fetus as a result of exposure to alcohol in the womb. From childhood through old age, individuals with FASD encounter barriers in everything they undertake in our society, from health care and education, to employment and housing. CFAN started as a grassroots movement over 15 years ago, founded by individuals who realized this complex disorder couldn&#39;t be addressed by any one family, organization, service or system. We&#39;ve grown into a registered charity that focuses on collaboration and collective impact with the aim to build a network of support and respect that allows children, youth, and adults to thrive in a society that understands their world.</p><p>We build that network in big ways through program funding and community-building and also in other ways that seem small, but mean so much. Our bursary program, The Empowerment Fund, for example, provides a big boost to individuals with FASD or their families and caregivers throughout the year. Natalie, a young woman with FASD who is a single mom with a toddler, needed to move out of her apartment this summer. Natalie is on AISH, has no vehicle and no friends with trucks who could help her move. She was very afraid she&#39;d have to use her grocery money for the month to pay for a moving company to relocate her.

Often, supports and services in these areas have waitlists, or paths to connecting with supports and services are complex and confusing. Sometimes, only short-term assistance is needed, such as help completing a form. Professionals with clients who have FASD may need advice on what kinds of community services there are, or on how best to work with someone with FASD. The Network Resource Worker helps in all these areas through offering information, referrals, system navigation, short-term supports, and advocacy.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.mycfan.ca/cfan-training-and-education/""><em><strong>Best Practices in FASD Interventions Training</strong></em></a> - Because of the nature of brain injury due to pre-natal alcohol exposure, the typical practices of systems such as education, justice, housing, health and employment often throw up barriers for people with FASD. CFAN has done research into best practices for supporting someone with FASD to succeed. We offer training to professionals who may encounter individuals with FASD in their day-to-day work, tailored to the organization&#39;s needs and time frame, helping frontline workers understand how to recognize someone who may be affected by FASD and work with them from a strengths-based, supportive, and respectful perspective.</p><p><a href=""http://www.mycfan.ca/cfan-training-and-education/""><em><strong>The Prevention Conversation</strong> <strong>Training</strong></em> </a>- Exposure to alcohol in the womb is the cause of FASD, but there is a lot of mixed messaging in our society about pregnancy and alcohol consumption. There is no proven safe level or timing of consumption, so no alcohol during the entire pregnancy is the best policy. However, often doctors and other professionals are reluctant to speak with women about this topic. The Prevention Conversation training teaches professionals and other supportive audiences how to hold short, motivational conversations with women to help broach the topic in a non-judgmental, non-threatening way. Through the Prevention Conversation, we aim to support women to have healthy pregnancies and healthy babies, reducing the incidence of FASD in our province.</p><p><em><strong>Direct FASD Service Funding</strong></em> - CFAN is part of the Government of Alberta&#39;s Cross-Ministry-Committee (CMC) FASD Initiative.

The 4 year old boy&#39;s head hurts and the words he hears from the big people in the room are jumbled and too big for him to understand. Why does it hurt so much, and why is he feeling confused all the time. To fill the dullness of this place his mind begins to wander to a recurring day-dream that he is playing a little violin just like the lady, a few months before, at the CPO&#39;s Saturday Morning at the Symphony. The beautiful music in his mind engulfs him briefly bringing him instant comfort. Josh is suddenly interrupted and fear returns as he looks to see his crying mother&#39;s face. He knows something is wrong, but it will be many years before he understands that this moment has changed his life forever.</p><p>That fateful day, Josh is diagnosed with neurofibramatosis. The petit and grand mal seizures intensify and the intensive care unit becomes his home over the Christmas holidays. Feeling sorry for Josh that he will not be with his brothers and sisters on Christmas morning, his neurologist asks him what one thing he wishes for most. On Christmas morning with his eyes as big as saucers, he excitedly opens the special gift from his doctor. It&#39;s a tiny 1/8 size violin!</p><p>The months and years pass and Josh learns to live with cognitive decline and impairments to his speech, language processing and increasing forgetfulnenss. Without the successes he experiences with the violin, his parents envision a decline in his spirit. Miraculously, his neurological deficits are not affecting his ability to play his violin. In fact, his music ability continues to improve and becomes the driving force and constant in his life. It is the one thing he knows he is improving at and enjoying.</p><p>At the age of 7, Josh&#39;s musical dreams get even bigger when he announces to his parents &quot;one day I want to be a Calgary Fiddler&quot;. The fiddle performance he attends with his violin teacher stirs an emotion within him of determination and drive. He is dreaming big, but he knows that with practice and hard work he can do it. And do it, he does! At the age of 14 while still experiencing seizures on a daily basis, Josh aces his audition for the Calgary Fiddlers and embarks on a 4-year journey of the most active and fulfilling musical years of his young life.</p><p>Josh credits music and fiddling, in particular, to his emotional and physical healing. Not only did performing and learning to fiddle (and mandolin) build his self-confidence, his leadership skills developed as he mentored new fiddlers to the group each year. Now, as a recent graduate of the Calgary Fiddlers program, Josh has joined a folk/indy music band and plans to go to college for music production.</p><p>The Calgary Fiddlers Association fiddle music education programs create amazing young people who gain so much from seeing first-hand how their music affects others, both emotionally and spiritually.&nbsp;</p>"	"public://org_profile/Violins in a row.jpg"	"Performers hold their voilins in a row, on the performance stage."	"Our performers see first-hand how their music affects others, both emotionally and spiritually"	"<p>The Calgary Fiddlers Association is a non-profit, charitable organization celebrating its 35th Anniversity during 2017.</p><p><strong>CFA Mandate:</strong> To preserve, promote and perform all types of fiddling, with a particular emphasis on Canadian styles.</p><ul><li><em><strong>Why? </strong></em><br /><p>Fiddling is an old art which emerged in 10th century Europe and has traditionally been passed down from generation to generation. This folk music has played an important and integral part in the cultural fabric of many nations, as well as Canada. For a time (not so long ago), there was an inherent risk the fiddle tradition was dying out. Our aim is to provide as many opportunities as possible for youth to continue the tradition of fiddling, or to be exposed to it, within Calgary and area.</p></li></ul><p><strong>CFA Mission:</strong> Through the art of&nbsp;Canadian fiddle music, we motivate, educate, and inspire children to develop musically and socially.</p><ul><li><em><strong>Why? </strong></em><p>The Calgary Fiddlers Association emerged from the classical violin program at Mount Royal Conservatory of Music in 1981. At that time, Dr. Norman Burgess was the Director of the Conservatory and his passion for innovation, creativity and excellence led him to create the Calgary Fiddlers program for young classically trained musicians. He loved classical violin and he LOVED to fiddle (his two worlds collided to create something VERY special). Our very unique programs motivate, educate and inspire classically trained youth to embrace classically-inspired fiddle music while making life-long friends.</p></li></ul><p><strong>CFA Vision:</strong> To develop life skills in our&nbsp;young students such as leadership, confidence, discipline, and time management, and an appreciation for the Canadian heritage of folk fiddling; all acquired with exposure to local and international performance experiences, while promoting and preserving the art of fiddle music.</p><ul><li><em><strong>Why? </strong></em><p>In addition to providing a rich musical education setting, the Association provides over 100 performance opportunities each year to young students. Performing allows our youth to develop essential skills that help them become amazing citizens within their community. They share toe-tapping fiddle culture and music with all ages in schools, seniors facilities, emergency shelters, conventions, malls and are ambassadors for Calgary, Alberta and Canada wherever they go.</p></li></ul><p><strong>HIGHLIGHTS (2015-2016):</strong></p><p>Despite the downturn during our latter fiscal year performance opportunities remaining steady. The Calgary Fiddlers were invited to perform at more conferences and conventions in Banff and Lake&nbsp;Louise which allowed us to have solid revenue. Additionally, we had a regular contract with Tauck&nbsp;Tours International for opportunities to perform at Heritage Park for their tourists approximately 20&nbsp;times during the summer months.</p><ul><li><strong>70 Students </strong>enrolled for<strong> 2016-2017</strong> (54 Bow Valley Fiddlers* and 16 Calgary Fiddlers)</li><li><strong>59 Students&nbsp;</strong>enrolled for<strong>&nbsp;2015-2016</strong>&nbsp;(44 Bow Valley Fiddlers* and 15 Calgary Fiddlers)</li><li><strong>400 Attendees </strong>at December 2015 Fiddle Fantasia presentation at the University Theatre</li><li><strong>320 Attendees</strong> at March 2016 Barn Dance at the Thorncliffe Greenview Community Hall</li><li><strong>300 Attendees </strong>at May 2016 two-hour show at the Ironwood Stage &amp; Grill</li></ul><p><em>* Bow Valley Fiddlers is large as it accepts fiddle students (ages 6-18) who want to learn to fiddle and do some performing throughout the year.

Over the years, the group has toured extensively throughout such places as Spain, France, Scotland &amp; Ireland, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Florida, Kansas, Iowa, Montana,Wyoming, Minnesota and Hawaii. They were chosen as ambassadors of Alberta for centennial celebrations in Ottawa, where they performed with the National Art Centre Orchestra in May 2005. They have been sent by the Alberta and Canadian Governments as ambassadors to Korea, Los Angeles, Monte Carlo and Monaco, and New York City. The Fiddlers have also had the privilege of performing for dignitaries such as H.S.H. Prince Albert of Monaco,former Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, Prime Minister Stephen Harper, the President of Yemen and His Holiness the fourteenth Dali Lama. Recent notable appearances include the opening of the &quot;Live with Kelly&quot; show in Banff, AB and a feature spot on the Australia TODAY show, filmed in Lake Louise.</p><p><strong>The Bow Valley Fiddlers</strong></p><p>The Bow Valley Fiddlers, created in 1995, is a division of The Calgary Fiddlers Association and although they are separate and distinct from The Calgary Fiddlers division, both groups fall under the same association.&nbsp; Bow Valley Fiddlers (ages 13-18 years of age) aspiring to dedicate more time to fiddling and performing; many audition to be members of the The Calgary Fiddlers.

How do we do it?</strong></p><p><em><strong>Weekly Rehearsals</strong></em></p><p>There are currently a total of 5 fiddle groups that meet weekly to learn fiddle tunes and accompanying choreography.&nbsp; Fiddling in an ensemble setting emphasizes listening skills, timing and teamwork.</p><p><em><strong>One-on-one Coaching</strong></em></p><p>Each fiddle student meets with fiddle instructors for several one-on-one coaching sessions each semester to learn the bowing techniques and timing unique to the fiddle genre.</p><p><em><strong>Workshops</strong></em></p><p>Intensive fiddle workshop weekends are offered to fiddle students twice per year. Clinicians are brought in to work with our students on dancing, choreography, public speaking, percussion and fiddling. On occasion. there are opportunities for our students to work with fiddle great such as Natalie MacMaster, Gordon Stobbe, Daniel Gervais and Ben Plotnick.</p><p><em><strong>Touring Opportunities</strong></em></p><p>Each year, our fiddlers have opportunities to perform either provincially, nationally and internationally. We feel touring is an integral addition to our programming. It allows our students to perform several full shows in culturally unique communities and countries. This opens their eyes to how others live, and to view the world in a musical context. The people and youth they meet on these tours also helps them to forge life-long relationships.</p><p><em><strong>Community Outreach Programs</strong></em></p><p><strong><em>1) </em></strong><em><strong>Healing Through Music</strong></em></p><p>In 2016, the Calgary Fiddlers Association implemented a unique outreach program to help meet the emotional needs of the community. These specialized performances are designed to improve mood and mobility, relieve anxiety, stress and depression, and enhance concentration and creativity through live interactive shows. Those living in seniors&#39; facilities, hospitals, hospices and temporary living facilities such as Inn From the Cold, and organizations empowering youth with disabilities are the greatest beneficiaries.</p><p><strong><em>2) </em></strong><em><strong>Spread Fiddle Music</strong></em></p><p>In 2012, as part of our 30th Anniversary year, the Association began the Spread Fiddle Music initiative. The primary goal of this initiative is to share fiddle music (and the love of music, in general) within school settings, and to inspire young students to take up a musical instrument of any kind.&nbsp; We also focus on the many diverse fiddle genres, and provide interactive opportunities for students to play the spoons, shakers, learn some traditional fiddle dances and to hold a violin.</p>"	"public://profiles/805a.jpg"	"Two performers fiddle together at centre stage"	"Our performances improve mood and mobility, relieve anxiety, stress and depression"	"<p>The Calgary Fiddlers Association is always seeking sponsors, donors and in-kind contributions to help stretch our budget.</p><p><strong>Financial Bursaries:</strong> Support a fiddler in need!</p><ul><li><strong>$550-$2000</strong> can help one of students pay for a whole year of fiddle programming (group rehearsals, one-on-one coaching, 2 fiddle camps, costumes and photo keepsake).</li></ul><p>Each year, we have students whose families are unable to meet the financial commitment of being in our program due to job loss, illness, work-related accidents and family separation/divorce.

Instantly she was put on bed rest and at just 27 weeks she went into labour. The team from the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) were on hand to assist with the delivery of her tiny and fragile babies. Being so early, they had a lot of growing to do and were kept in incubators with machines to help them breathe until their lungs were big enough to take their first breaths on their own.

Today, Don celebrates every moment he has with his family - the family he was so close to losing.</p><p><em>&ldquo;My wife almost lost her husband and my kids almost lost their father. This is my opportunity to say thanks to all the staff, nurses and doctors who have really given me my life [back], because my life was over and I like to say now I am playing the bonus round. But, because of the life I&rsquo;ve been given I&rsquo;m able to help other people moving forward. So, thank you!&rdquo;</em></p><p><strong>Preventing complications and providing high quality of life: &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Every day, Dr. Heidi Rabi sees patients that cannot afford basic dental care. Oral health is often the window to overall health, and when people don&#39;t have the money for proper oral care, they can face serious health complications down the road. Funding for the dental program goes a long way in not only addressing dental concerns before they spread to serious infections and complications, but also gives patients that little bit of self-confidence they need to go out and face the world.</p><p><em>&ldquo;For a patient, fixing the way that they look when they open their mouth, or smile, is a complete life changer, because you take them from somebody who is possibly ashamed of being in public and you transform their life. The amount of confidence they gain from being able to open their mouths, from being able to smile, is a complete game changer.&rdquo;</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These are just a few examples of how donations touch the lives of the people in our community.</p><p>That&rsquo;s where Calgary Health Trust comes in &ndash; we see the big picture and work with the community to make philanthropic investments in areas of health that will have the biggest impact.

Our role is to help inspire the community to take action in ensuring that we have the best health care right in our own back yard. Donations are critical in driving innovation forward and taking health care from good to great. There are many ways that we work with people in the community to help them make an impact that will last for generations to come.</p><p>Through our mixed fundraising approach, donors have lots of options in how they make a difference to health care. Donors can choose to make a difference in many ways, such as the following:</p><ol><li><a href=""http://calgaryhealthtrust.ca/Donate/""><strong>Donate</strong></a>: Every day donors make contributions to hospitals and programs because they have been greatly impacted by the care they&rsquo;ve received or they believe that investments in health care are so important to our city. We couldn&rsquo;t agree more! <strong>You can donate online at calgaryhealthtrust.ca, by phone at 403-943-0615 or by visiting our office at any of our hospitals</strong>.</li><li><a href=""http://calgaryhealthtrust.ca/donate/legacy-giving/""><strong>Leave a Legacy</strong></a>: A Planned Gift is a thoughtful way to make a lasting impact on an organization. Planned gifts are easy to arrange and with the help of your advisors can help you develop a plan that provides for your loved ones, maximizes tax and financial benefits and makes a difference to everyone in the community.</li><li><a href=""http://calgaryhealthtrust.ca/donate/legacy-giving/endowments/""><strong>Create an Endowment</strong></a>: An endowment fund is a gift that keeps giving. A modest donation of $5,000 can plant the seed for the growth of a significant endowment down the road.</li><li><a href=""http://calgaryhealthtrust.ca/donate/shares-and-securities/""><strong>Give a Gift of Shares</strong></a>: Donating publicly traded shares, bonds or mutual funds is becoming increasingly popular because of&nbsp;significant tax saving incentives. A gift of securities to Calgary Health Trust can completely eliminate the steep capital gains tax you would incur if you were to sell these assets and donate the proceeds.</li><li><a href=""http://calgaryhealthtrust.ca/donate/community-initiative/community-initiative-toolkit/""><strong>Create a Community Initiative</strong></a>: Our Community Partners are instrumental to raising money for areas that are important to them. They do everything from golf-tournaments to art sales to hosting runs. Their work helps get the word out about how health care is making a difference in the lives of many people in our community.</li><li><a href=""http://calgaryhealthtrust.ca/events/""><strong>Sponsor or Support an Event</strong></a>: Events are an important part of the work that we do. Sponsors and ticket purchasers help to ensure that we can maximize the proceeds raised for the cause while ensuring that everyone has a great time.</li><li><a href=""http://calgaryhealthtrust.ca/lotteries/""><strong>Buy a Hospital Home Lottery ticket</strong></a>: Our lotteries are important to raising significant funds for our hospitals. We run two programs: the Foothills Hospital Home Lottery in the Spring and the Hospital Home Lottery in the Fall.</li><li><a href=""http://calgaryhealthtrust.ca/about-us/volunteer-with-us/""><strong>Volunteer</strong></a>: We are always looking for dynamic volunteers that want to make a difference. Please visit our website to see what volunteer opportunities we have available.</li></ol><p>If you are unable to make a contribution at this time, we are always looking for people who will be an advocate for the work that we do every day.

Since the launch of the plan, almost 7,000 people have been housed with essential supports to help them thrive in our communities.</p><p>This past November, 29 families experiencing homelessness in Calgary would have gone another Christmas without a home if it weren&rsquo;t for CHF and six partner service agencies working with the Calgary Residential Rental Association (CRRA) and several Calgary landlords. Instead, these families moved into a home of their home through a campaign called &ldquo;Hope for the Holidays, Celebrate the Season at Homes.&rdquo; This campaign has been specifically designed to permanently house families chronically living on Calgary&rsquo;s streets or in shelters.</p><ul><li><em>&ldquo;Home provides kids with that sense of security, that sense of belonging,&rdquo; shares Dustin, a client recently housed through Calgary&#39;s Plan to End Homelessness with his two young children.&nbsp;<em><em>&quot;Now&hellip;we walk down the street and we come up to our building and we can actually say:&nbsp;<em><em>Oh, we&rsquo;re home.

"681"	"Calgary Horticultural Society"	"3"	"<p>Carol came to Calgary, as many people do, because of work. Once settled, she started looking for things to do and ways to connect with other people.&nbsp;</p><p>One day, Carol spotted a community garden from the bus on her way home. That fleeting glimpse of a well-tended veggie patch flooded her with longing and fond memories of her Grandma&rsquo;s garden back home. As a child, she often visited and &ldquo;helped out&rdquo; by sampling fresh peas in the pod, sweet raspberries and countless other home-grown treats.</p><p>Although she was living in a small condo with no yard of her own, Carol felt inspired and determined to try her own hand at gardening, satisfying that nostalgic urge to taste truly fresh-picked produce again. She searched for community gardens in Calgary online and found the Calgary Horticultural Society&rsquo;s website, which informed her that there was indeed a community garden not too far from her condo. She also found that the Society offered a wealth of tips and information on growing vegetables, flowers and trees in Calgary&rsquo;s unique climate.</p><p>Carol eagerly joined the Society and signed on for a number of workshops, learning which vegetables and plants grow best in Calgary, how to start plants from seed, how to improve the soil, water wisely and when to harvest.</p><p>At her local community garden Carol met people of all ages from within her own neighbourhood who shared her love of gardening and spending time in the outdoors. From her first season in the garden, Carol was amazed at her success and the number of friends and acquaintances she made. She was very proud to be able to serve some of her own vegetables to dinner guests.</p><p>During her second season at the garden she was asked to help co-ordinate the group&rsquo;s efforts to improve their heavy clay soil. Back she went to the Horticultural Society to educate herself on best practices for composting and soil amendment. With the help of other volunteers, Carol created a successful composting program that is still in place today. She joined in on the Society&rsquo;s monthly <em>Kitchen Table Talks for community garden leaders</em>, shared her knowledge and ideas and picked up additional gardening and community building tips.</p><p>By attending education sessions, plant and garlic exchanges and events, reading the newsletter and using her member&rsquo;s discount, Carol realized that there are many dimensions to this enjoyable, rewarding and affordable activity in her newly adopted city.</p><p>Years later, when she married and purchased a house with her new partner, Carol moved her gardening base from the community garden to her very own back yard. She enjoys encouraging her small children to help out and hopes to instil a love of gardening in them as well. She maintains her connection with her many gardening buddies and is still an active member in the Calgary Horticultural Society. She especially enjoys and appreciates the Society&rsquo;s plant sharing events, and Open Garden program, which allows her to visit other members&rsquo; gardens, picking up lots of tips and fresh ideas along the way.</p><p>While Carol&rsquo;s story is unique to her, countless other individuals have learned a great deal about gardening and have formed lasting friendships through the Calgary Horticultural Society. Although our climate can be a challenge, we can all beautify our own yards, balconies and public spaces with an almost endless variety of gorgeous plants and trees. The Society has just under 5,000 members and we <strong>always</strong> have room for more&mdash;so please consider joining us, learning from us, sharing with us and volunteering as time permits.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Carol&rsquo;s name has been changed to protect her privacy.</em></p>"	"public://org_profile/5419e5d2-496c-4f56-bd96-480a0ab22176.jpg"	"Father and child volunteer together in the Society's demonstration and teaching garden"	"The love of gardening can start at a very young age and last a lifetime."

Weighing barely a pound and no more than three weeks old, Krikit was in trouble. Young kittens rely on their mothers for everything, but Krikit&rsquo;s mother was nowhere to be found. Knowing that Krikit&rsquo;s future was uncertain, the Good Samaritan decided to give him the best possible chance and brought him to Calgary Humane Society.</p><p>On arrival, Krikit was rushed back to the CHS veterinary staff for examination where it was discovered that an eye infection had sealed his right eye shut. Krikit was gently bathed with warm water to remove the dirt and grime that coated his fur and face and treated with antibiotics to help his eye heal. Then came the next challenge &ndash; Krikit had to eat.</p><p>Krikit was still too young to eat solid foods, and with no mother to provide him with milk, his future would be uncertain. One of our animal health technologists coaxed Krikit to accept a bottle of Mammalac, a kitten milk replacement. Learning that Krikit would accept the replacement milk was a relief &ndash; he could survive and thrive as long as he was eating &ndash; but due to his size and level of development he would need to be fed every two or three hours around the clock.</p><p>Foster families do life-saving work at Calgary Humane Society. Within hours of Krikit&rsquo;s admission, a wonderful foster parent answered our emergency call for help, agreeing to take on the daunting task of &ldquo;24 hour cat mom&rdquo;. Under the watchful eyes of his foster parent and CHS veterinary staff, Krikit transformed from a tiny helpless kitten to a bouncing ball of feline energy. The weeks flew by as Krikit grew stronger and discovered the joy of normal kitten mischief. During his time with Calgary Humane Society Krikit won over the hearts of his foster family and every staff member who met him. After almost two months of care Krikit was ready to find a new home&hellip; and within four hours of being moved to the adoptions floor Krikit had won over another set of hearts &ndash; the hearts of his new forever family.</p>"	"public://org_profile/31398963.JPG"	"Grey cat with green eyes looking at the camera with interest."

Sindhu, co-founder of the Calgary Immigrant Educational Society. As an immigrant himself, Mr. Sindhu sought to create a unique community where newcomers could develop the skills needed to find their rightful place in Canadian society. With its humble beginnings in 1988, C.I.E.S. has grown to include over 150 dedicated staff and over 100 volunteers who provide an&nbsp;<strong>&quot;one-stop-shop&quot;</strong> for new immigrants and economically challenged individuals. With its mission to help provide free and lost-cost alternatives to expensive settlement programming, C.I.E.S. strives to:</p><ul><li>Provide English as a Second Language classes to newcomers.</li><li>Assist newcomers and low income Canadians in&nbsp;becoming more self-sufficient through employment.</li><li>Give fair access to newcomers to existing services and organizations by helping them&nbsp;overcome the various barriers encountered in the settlement process.</li><li>Promote a mutual understanding and respect between the mainstream and ethnic communities on cultural issues.</li><li>Deliver programming for the people who need it, not only those who can afford it.</li></ul><p>With 29 years of experience and a blended staff of newcomers and immigrants, C.I.E.S. is proud to provide a personal, compassionate environment that feels like home. For a greater idea of how we serve the community, here is what one of our graduates had to say:</p><p><em>&quot;A friend informed me of the Calgary Immigrant Educational Society which led me to do some research on the courses they offer; this influenced my decision to pursue the Basic Computer Skills course. Our instructor Mr. Mayuanan Selvaratnam delivered the instructional material efficiently and effectively, therefore, the content was easily understood.&nbsp; My other classmates can attest to the fact that we were all motivated to learn. He had our interest at heart and was able to facilitate our individual learning challenges. Pursuing this course has made a tremendous impact on my computer knowledge and skills. I am now familiar with the different components of the computer, software, and applications. I can confidently say I can formulate a proper document for execution and manipulate the computer more readily.&nbsp;</em><em>I am currently encouraging friends, co-workers and family members to pursue this course and other courses offered by this Institution&quot;. - </em>Elizabeth D.B.</p>"	"public://org_profile/WelcomeCentre Thumbnail.jpg"	"C.I.E.S. - Building the Future"	"The Welcome Centre for New Immigrants (CIES' Northeast branch)"	"<p>The Calgary Immigrant Educational Society (C.I.E.S.) provides various levels of English education, employment training, job bank information, and referral guidance to newcomers and economically disadvantaged Calgarians in an effort to help them find their rightful place in Canadian society.</p><p><strong>ANNUAL HIGHLIGHTS (2015-16):</strong></p><ul><li>Open 7 days a week, we serve more than 1200 adult clients and 135 children a day at two&nbsp;locations; and we also opened 21 additional LINC classes, making it 56 LINC classes in total and 135 childcare seats;</li><li>We established a cutting edge Communications Department, and introduced The Refugee Express Drop-In ESL &amp; Integration (REDI) Program;&nbsp;</li><li>We found that 2015-2016 brought CIES a steady&nbsp;growth of programs and with it a large increase in the number of staff.</li></ul><p><strong>WE MAKE SURE YOU KNOW THE LANGUAGE</strong></p><p>Our variety of robust English education programs help students from over 75 different countries everyday. With this sort of reach, it&#39;s important to us that every student feels heard and welcome.

BRING YOUR KIDS TO SCHOOL</strong></p><p>For students of our L.I.N.C. English program, C.I.E.S. provides in-office childminding care. New creative activities are conducted each day through motor activities, arts, and circle time. This freedom for newcomers to practice their English while their kids are learning and playing has been regarded as one of C.I.E.S.&#39; essential services since its inception. For individuals who aren&#39;t learning English at C.I.ES., don&#39;t worry - we&#39;ll put you in touch with quality community daycares that have a schedule that will work for you.</p><p><strong>BRINGING NEWCOMERS AND BUSINESSES TOGETHER</strong></p><p>Getting a job can be hard, but it doesn&#39;t have to be. With programs focused on building computer skills, employability, business communication, entrepreneurship, and more, C.I.E.S. helps individuals prepare for the Canadian labour market and find a job. Affordable part-time and full-time classes ensure that it&#39;s not only the people who can afford the help, but the people who need it, who get the chance to learn and grow.</p><p><strong>CAN&#39;T COME TO SCHOOL?

In her home country, Olua had a successful career as a school administrator, but in Canada due to her qualifications not being recognized, she decided to become a Licensed Practical Nurse. She was trying her best to juggle her responsibilities in raising three young boys and a full time class load. Shortly after starting her studies, Olua was required to be at her school thirty minutes earlier one day for a class photo which meant she would not be home to send her eldest son Michael (seven years old) off to the school bus. Olua made a decision that her son was responsible enough to catch the bus by himself and left him with instructions. However, her son missed the bus as he was watching cartoons and decided to stay home. When the school called Olua&rsquo;s house to inquire about Michael&rsquo;s absence, Michael answered the phone and shared that he was at home alone. The school staff called the police and had them pick Michael up and drive him to school and also reported this to Child and Family Services.</p><p>Olua was referred to Cross-Cultural Parenting Program at CIWA by a case worker from Child and Family Services. Due to Olua&rsquo;s busy school schedule, the CCPP facilitator met with her one-on-one after her she finished her classes for the day. The Program Facilitator worked around Olua&rsquo;s schedule and went over the entire course curriculum with her within four sessions. Olua learned about child abuse laws, the Canadian school system, positive discipline, institutional pressures, parenting styles, and healthy child development.</p><p>After several weeks of participation in the Cross-Cultural Parenting Program, Olua felt she had a much better understanding of how to be a successful parent in Canada. She felt more confident to advocate for herself with her son&rsquo;s school and Child and Family Services. Her file with Child and Family Services was closed, which brought her huge relief and allowed Olua to refocus on her family and her studies.</p><p>CIWA exists for women like Olua. CIWA is a culturally diverse settlement agency that recognizes, responds to, and focuses on the unique concerns and needs of immigrant and refugee women, girls and their families. CIWA&rsquo;s uniqueness is based on having a narrow gender related mandate, which has provided best practices in developing customized female focused initiatives.&nbsp; These initiatives always include children and their well-being as important outcomes of our engagement.CIWA is empowering immigrant women and their families to integrate in the community.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"	"public://org_profile/Staff.jpg"	"5 CIWA Staff smiling for photo"	"CIWA staff empowers immigrant women and their families"	"<p>CIWA takes a holistic and wraparound approach to addressing integration challenges immigrant women and their families face when settling in a new country. CIWA&rsquo;s mandate is as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>VISION:&nbsp;</strong></li><li>Empower Immigrant Women. Enrich Canadian society.</li><li><strong>MISSION:&nbsp;</strong></li><li>To engage and integrate immigrant women and their families in the community.</li><li><strong>VALUES:&nbsp;</strong></li><li>Integrity. Equity. Empowerment. Relevance. Collaboration.</li></ul><p>During its 30 year history, CIWA has developed innovative programs, entered into partnerships and become an organization that is truly responsive to the unique and diverse needs of its constituency. Over the years, CIWA has made the transition to Canada a more comfortable, pleasant and successful one for more than 80,000 immigrant women.</p><p>CIWA focuses its financial strategy on strengthening core programs in the areas of settlement, language training, employment skills, and family services. We also respond to tenders for new pilot initiatives by developing innovative program ideas to compete with other agencies for government funding. We feel confident that our funders value the good work that we do for clients and our adherence to standards of professional accountability.</p><p>A key component to CIWA&rsquo;s financial growth and sustainability involves the enhancement of fund development strategies through research, consultations, networking and development of strong partnerships. We will continue to work towards expanding funding for enhanced language training projects, skills training, and other projects aimed at supporting clients with basic needs and/or family violence issues. We hope that our effort to connect with the corporate sector will provide further stability for the organization through small projects that will benefit our clients and the entire Calgary community.</p><p>Over the years, CIWA has been locally and nationally recognized for our commitment to serving immigrant women and their families through collaborative and innovative approaches to service delivery.

It is important for CIWA to support this highly barriered and isolated client group.&nbsp; CIWA values inclusion and strives to support all immigrant women in their integration process.&nbsp; Due to the lack of formal education, these women are missing foundational learning skills and are not equipped to function fully in a text driven society.

I suffered years of abuse in my childhood.&nbsp; Both of my parents were alcoholics and would leave me and my siblings for days at a time. Starting when I was about 8 years old, when my parents took off, I had to look after my sisters who were 5 and 6 years younger than me. When my parents were home, they were physically and verbally abusive. I was molested many times by relatives and friends of my parents.&nbsp; At 14 years old, I left home and moved in with a 23 year old man that I met at a dance. He was just like my parents, although there were times that I thought he loved me. During the 8 years with him, I had 3 children, 2 girls and a boy. They were my world and I vowed not to be like my parents.&nbsp; But, like others who have addiction and mental health issues, I started to use alcohol to cope. My worst fear had come true&hellip;I became my parents.&nbsp;</p><p>When I was 22, my sister took my children with the promise that once I got my life together, I could have them back. I was devastated and I started to use any drug I could find.&nbsp; I left my boyfriend and moved to Calgary where I knew no one. For the next 10 years I lived on the streets of Calgary. Sometimes I slept at a homeless shelter. Mostly I slept outside because I didn&rsquo;t trust the other people who stayed there. My days consisted of lots of walking, trying to find money for booze or drugs.&nbsp; I had to carry everything I owned in my back pack because it would be stolen if I didn&rsquo;t. I tried to sober up so many times, but every time I got clean, bad memories came back and I just couldn&rsquo;t cope with them. My sister went to court and I lost custody of my children. The pain was unbearable.&nbsp;</p><p>When I was homeless, I was physically and sexually assaulted by other street people and men who preyed on people like me. The street doctor I saw diagnosed me with post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. He said I probably had this all my life because of my childhood and the life I was living on the street surely didn&rsquo;t help.&nbsp; After suffering yet another assault and waking up in the hospital, I made the decision to try treatment again. I was accepted into an addiction treatment centre and for the first time in many years, I felt a little bit of hope for my future.</p><p>I worked hard, faithfully took my medication for my mental health and I was feeling so much better. Two months later, I was nearly finished treatment and I was petrified. I would be going back to the violence, surrounded by others&rsquo; drug and alcohol abuse, and the desperation to survive each day living on the streets. Luckily for me, this time I was introduced to &quot;Keys.&quot;</p><p>Keys to Recovery is an agency like no other. They gave me an apartment with rent that I can afford and they gave me furniture to put in it. They come and visit me in my apartment to help me with things like my mental health, addictions counseling and teach me ways to stay clean and sober. They don&rsquo;t judge me and I trust them. I have relapsed a few times and I was evicted from 4 apartments. They didn&rsquo;t give up on me. During my last relapse, I was full of shame and I was afraid they would kick me out so I avoided the case managers and I refused to open my door when they came to visit. They spoke to me through the door for over an hour and a half telling me that they would not give up on me. I finally opened my door, went to my last treatment centre, and I am now 24 months sober. My children are now 19, 17 and 14 and they are doing good.&nbsp; They still live with my sister in another city but I see them as often as I can and we talk on the phone and Facebook every day.&nbsp; I am a work in progress and I am healing from all the trauma I have been through. Life today is good.&nbsp; If Keys has given up on me, I would have gone back to the streets and I know I would have died.&nbsp;</p>"	"public://org_profile/Keys To Recovery26.jpg"	"Healing from trauma"	"""They would not give up on me"""	"<p>As part of Calgary&rsquo;s 10 Year Plan to End Homelessness, Calgary Keys to Recovery Society was developed to stop homeless individuals from returning to the streets once they have completed addictions treatment. &nbsp;This is an integral part of Calgary&#39;s sytstem of care.</p><p><strong>Vision Statement:</strong> &nbsp;To permanently end homelessness with dignity, compassion, and support for adults recovering from addictions.</p><p><strong>Mission Statement: </strong>&nbsp;Keys to Recovery provides intensive, collaborative case management services, in conjunction with permanent, affordable housing, for highly vulnerable adults who have completed addictions treatment.</p><p>By not only providing housing but the support they needed to maintain their sobriety and their housing, last year we PERMANENTLY ended homelessness for 100 men and women. &nbsp;Unlike traditional addictions services, we do not discharge a client if they relapse. &nbsp;Keys to Recovery understands that relapse can be a part of the recovery process but that it doesn&#39;t mean that the person needs to become homeless once again. &nbsp;We continue to support the person, in whatever way they need, in order to get them back on track. &nbsp;This may look different for each individual. &nbsp;For one person it could mean a return to residential treatment. &nbsp;For another, it could mean an outpatient day program. &nbsp;Some may require increased home visits until they stablize once again while others need to be relocated to a different apartment. &nbsp;Our Case Management team will work alonside each client to determine what type of supports are needed.</p>"	"public://org_profile/KTR-logo.png"	"Keys to Recovery"	"Keys to Recovery"	"<p>Calgary Keys to Recovery Society (Keys to Recovery) conducts an assessment with each referred individual to ensure that they are highly vulnerable (chronically homeless), low income, mental health and/or chronic physical condition and that they require intensive case management support in order to maintain their housing and their sobriety.

Calgary Keys to Recovery Society will hold the lease on all apartments and will pay the market rental amount directly to the property manager for each apartment. The client will reimburse Calgary Keys to Recovery Society an amount each month based on 30% of their monthly income plus utilities. &nbsp;</p><p>Clients are visited by case managers in their homes on a regular basis, depending upon clients&#39; level of need but ranges from daily to weekly. Upon acceptance and at three month intervals thereafter, case managers will conduct various evidenced based assessments in the following areas:&nbsp; current needs, vocational, physical, mental health, leisure, financial, housing, addictions, and cultural. Based upon these assessments, the case manager will work with the client to develop a service plan, which is also reviewed every three months, and is entirely determined by the client.&nbsp;</p><p>Keys to Recovery offers several services in various areas such as addictions counseling/relapse prevention, traditional Aboriginal ceremonies, job or volunteer readiness, psychiatric support, and systems navigation. We also offer 24/7 crisis support.</p><p>Keys to Recovery is PERMANENT supportive housing. &nbsp;Due to the high acuity of our clients and their complex needs, there is no maximum length of stay. &nbsp;However, we do have three phases that clients can move through. &nbsp;The first phase is the Stabilization Phase. &nbsp;Here, clients are seen by our psychiatrist and psychiatric nurse who provides a full psychiatric assessment. &nbsp;A mental health plan is developed alongside the client. &nbsp;This phase is from 0-12 months.</p><p>The Preparation Phase is the 2nd phase and is from 1-5 years. &nbsp;In this phase, the clients get their high school diploma, access post-secondary education or re-enter the workforce. &nbsp;The clients are preparing for graduation and independence. &nbsp;Keys to Recovery continues to support them with a Rent Geared to Income subsidy, case management and financial assistance for items such as school books, bus tickets, work boots, work clothes, resume and interview preparation, etc.</p><p>The 3rd and final phase is the Graduation Phase and is 5+ years in length. &nbsp;This phase involves the client completing post-secondary education, and becoming gainfully employed. &nbsp;The client is stable in their recovery, their employment, and their mental health. &nbsp;They are fully integrated into their communities and are able to be fully independent. &nbsp;They will then become Keys to Recovery Alumni and will be able to become a Peer Support for other Keys to Recovery clients.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"	"public://profiles/Picture1.png"	"Housing"	"A Keys to Recovery apartment building"	"<p><strong>Donate</strong></p><p>Keys to Recovery has set an initial goal of increasing the organization&rsquo;s annual budget by $500,000 for this year, which will greatly enhance the opportunities for the success of our clients to transition to normalized living in the community. &nbsp;Your support will make a great impact on our clients&#39; lives and the City of Calgary as a whole by giving them a chance to become productive members of society. &nbsp;It doesn&#39;t get much better than that!</p><p>This is what your support would provide:</p><p><strong>$100</strong></p><ul><li>Household supplies for one client when they move into their new apartment.</li><li>Bus pass for one month for one client.</li><li>Photo identification for 5 clients.</li></ul><p><strong>$250</strong></p><ul><li>Start up groceries for a new client.</li><li>Bedding for 5 clients (sheets and comforter).</li><li>A traditional Aboriginal ceremony (honorarium paid to an Elder for a sweat or healing circle) for all clients.</li></ul><p><strong>$500</strong></p><ul><li>Supplies for the Art Group for 20 clients</li><li>20 GED preparation study guides</li><li>Provide Christmas gifts and dinner for 10 clients</li></ul><p><strong>$1000</strong></p><ul><li>Subsidized rent for 2 clients for one month.</li><li>Psychiatric treatment &amp; support for six months for 1 client.</li><li>Damage deposit for one apartment.</li></ul><p><strong>$1500</strong></p><ul><li>Fully furnish one apartment.</li><li>Start up groceries for 6 new clients.</li><li>Tuition for grade 12 upgrading.</li></ul><p><strong>Volunteer</strong></p><p>We are always looking for volunteers who are looking for ways to impact the lives of others in various ways.

As time continues to march on, many of these marvelous war time machines and the valiant men who flew them are disappearing, taking with them the evocative and heroic stories of Canada&rsquo;s contribution to world history.&nbsp;</p><p>In 1954, Spartan Aviation of Ottawa purchased 15 World War II Mosquito bomber aircraft from the British government and brought them to Canada to fulfill photo mapping contracts, in which, for the first time, all of Canada was mapped using aerial cameras. As world leaders in aerial photo mapping, Spartan used the aircraft throughout Northern Canada, West Africa, South and Central America until 1962.&nbsp;</p><p>Upon retirement, one of the Mosquitoes was sold to a group in Calgary which sought to establish an aviation museum in the City. When this organization failed in the late 1960s, the City of Calgary took ownership and possession of the Mosquito and a dozen other vintage aircraft.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2012, after a five year campaign to prevent the overseas sale of the aircraft, the City of Calgary signed a contract with the Calgary Mosquito Aircraft Society allowing us to take possession of the Mosquito and Hurricane so that they could finally be restored. The Society has subcontracted the restoration of the Hurricane to a professional aircraft restoration company in Wetaskiwin, AB while focusing its volunteer efforts on the restoration of the Mosquito in space provided by the Bomber Command Museum of Canada, located in Nanton, AB.</p><p>The Hurricane will be restored as it served during WWII in 133 Squadron on Canada&rsquo;s west coast.&nbsp; The Mosquito will be restored as it flew and served in Canada with Spartan Air Services, making it the only non-military Mosquito in the world.&nbsp; The aircraft will not be flown, but both will be brought to ground running, or taxi status.&nbsp; Upon completion, both will be returned to the City of Calgary.&nbsp;</p><p>If you are interested in following our progress, see us on Facebook &ndash; Calgary Mosquito Society, or at our website: <strong><a href=""http://calgarymosquitosociety.com"">http://calgarymosquitosociety.com</a>&nbsp;</strong>Or on Facebook: <strong><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/MossieSociety/"">https://www.facebook.com/groups/MossieSociety/</a></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p>"	"public://org_profile/WEB-Home_Snip_Mar3.JPG"	"Pilots with the de Havilland DH.98 Mosquito, RS700/CF-HMS"	"Pilots with the de Havilland DH.98 Mosquito, RS700/CF-HMS"	"<p>In addition to the physical restoration of the two aircraft, our mandate is also to Honour and Educate; Honour those who designed, built, flew and serviced these aircraft in wartime and in peace and to Educate ourselves and others about the significant place in Canadian history of these rare machines and the pivotal work they did.</p><p>Since acquiring the aircraft in 2012, we&#39;ve built new steel jigs for the Mosquito fuselage and wing, acquired a very rare original Wild aerial camera, tracked down and purchased wartime de Havilland specification birch plywood, scrounged missing parts from around the world and begun the delicate and exacting work of repairing the structural damage to the Mosquito fuselage. &nbsp;</p><p>We&#39;ve sub-contracted the restoration of the Hurricane to Historic Aviation Services in Wetaskiwin, AB., while we retain the airplane&#39;s Merlin engine in Nanton where we have brought it back to running status so that visitors can enjoy the sight and sound of the Hurricane&#39;s mighty Merlin engine when the restoration is complete. &nbsp;</p><p>As well we have been invited to numerous international conferences to speak not just about the aircraft and the work to preserve them but to share with museum professionals around the world our unique web of partnerships with government, business and other not for profits that allowed us to prevent the sale of these airplanes overseas, to raise all the money required to restore them and to put together a team to get it all done.

This birthday was special because a girl that you like came and gave you a mix CD. The whole school year, you have been secretly crushing on Danielle, a fellow 11th grader. You feel worried because you don&rsquo;t think your parents will approve.</p><p>Your family is conservative, and you have always felt worried that they would not approve of who you truly are. You often feel scared and isolated when you see your friends bullying other kids, and calling them gay. You feel like you are living two lives, and all the secrets are catching up with you. Then, all of your fears melt away when Danielle grabs your hand under the picnic table. The person you like likes you back. You are on top of the world.</p><p>Your worst fears are confirmed when after the party, your mother and father confront you. They saw you holding hands with Danielle and they let you know in no uncertain terms that being gay is not apart of your family&rsquo;s values and if you continue You will no longer be welcome in the family or their home. You stop talking to Danielle and join your friends in bullying other schoolmates, worried that someone will find out the truth.</p><p>The months that follow become increasingly more bleak. The loneliness of living in the shadows eats away at you. You are having trouble getting out of bed, can&rsquo;t help but feel like things would be easier if you weren&rsquo;t around. One night, while you are watching TV with your parents, your Dad scoffs at some gay characters on television, saying: &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t want to end up like those freaks&rdquo;. He&rsquo;s right. You don&rsquo;t, but as hard as you have tried, you feel like you will always be like this. You begin to plan how you will take your life.&nbsp;</p><p>Then you see a phone number for &ldquo;LGBTQ* Peer Support Hotline. You call in and for the first time tell someone you&rsquo;re gay. It&rsquo;s such a relief to say it out loud. The woman on the other side of the phone is understanding and supportive. You feel heard and accepted for who you are for the first time. It gives you hope.</p><p>You start attending a LGBTQ* youth group and after a few months, your self-respect and self-esteem grows. It was great to be with others that understood. You were not alone after all.</p><p>You finally see that you can have a good life as a gay person. Your grades improve and you start to be interested in life again.</p><p>You even mustered the courage to face your parents. Giving them information and resources. Eventually they start going to a support group for parents of gay children, and come to accept you for who you are.</p><p>NOTES:</p><p>Rates of suicide in Lesbian, Bisexual &amp; Gay Youth are 14 times that of their heterosexual peers.

There over 15 performance categories including school bands, Chinese ethnic instruments, choral music, drama, guitar, musical theatre, piano, strings and woodwind to name just a few.</p><p>For over 80 years the Festival has focused on expanding our categories so that we continue to reflect performance trends and the interests of our audience. Most recently in 2015, Festival added a popular guitar category to encourage students who are learning to play the guitar but are not interested in classical music.&nbsp; New classes for Chinese ethnic instruments were added a few years ago and prove to be very popular. More recently, performance piano, which is non-competitive and non-adjudicated, was added to give participants an opportunity to gain confidence from the experience of public performance without the pressure of being marked.</p><p>A very important aspect of Festival for many young performers is the adjudication. We invite adjudicators, well-respected within in their field, to offer constructive oral and written feedback with the intention of nurturing the budding talent and growing passion for performance.</p><p>Outside of Festival time, we host concerts and collaborate with local performing arts organizations so that we may provide Festival participants with additional opportunities to perform publicly and share their passion for the arts.</p><p>Festival is a member of the <a href=""http://www.albertamusicfestival.org/Main.aspx"">Alberta Music Festival Association </a>(AMFA) and the <a href=""http://www.fcmf.org/index.html"">Federation of Canadian Music Festivals </a>(FCMF) which provides those who excel locally with the opportunity to advance to the provincial or national levels.</p>"	"public://org_profile/2014MT097for web.gif"	""	"Calgary Performing Arts Festival Theatre Group"	"<p>Our Festival is generally held over a three-week period with classes running daily from 9:00a.m. &ndash; 9:00 p.m. on eight different stages throughout the Mount Royal University campus.

Phil Watt didn&rsquo;t start off on the right track.</p><p>&ldquo;I remember taking my first lollipop from the store when I was not even in school,&rdquo; the 17-year-old remembers. &ldquo;If you told me not to do something, I wanted to do it that much more.&rdquo;</p><p>His father was involved with drugs and had gang affiliations in Calgary&mdash;meaning his mother was left to raise him on her own. Watt started sneaking out and failing school.</p><p>&ldquo;Every day I got a call - they had me on speed dial,&rdquo; his mother Kristen Luu says. &ldquo;Stealing people&rsquo;s lunches, getting in fights with kids&hellip;grounding him didn&rsquo;t work, taking away privileges didn&rsquo;t work, he would just defy me.&rdquo;</p><p>At age 12, Watt was caught shoplifting at Chinook Centre, and police concluded he was a high risk to become a gang member. But instead of sending him through the court system, they paired him up with the Calgary Police Youth at Risk Development Program (YARD). Cst. Al Devolin spent time with Watt, got him and his mother into counselling and set him up with a tutor. Not only did Watt&rsquo;s grades shoot way up, but he&rsquo;s become an accomplished track-and-field athlete. He also has a new outlook.</p><p>&ldquo;I was so blinded by &lsquo;<em>I am the ruler, the world revolves around me.</em>&rsquo; I look back and go wow, I was egotistic.&rdquo;</p><p>Devolin says that early intervention is important.</p><p>&ldquo;The earlier you get to the young guy in the family, the easier it is to turn things around,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;This is the gold standard. This is what we would like for all of our families and kids to achieve. That&rsquo;s the hope.&rdquo;</p><p>Watt says all that he has achieved so far is just the beginning.</p><p>&ldquo;I know exactly where I should be and where I could go. I would rather be on the side where people respect me.&rdquo;</p><p>According to his mother, as of 2015, Phil is on the Dean&rsquo;s list in Chemical Engineering with a super high GPA.</p><p><em>Story written by Nancy Hixt, Global TV Calgary</em></p>"	"public://org_profile/CPF WHY Img Young Man.png"	""	" Calgary Police Youth at Risk Development Program (YARD) provided hope"	"<p><strong>OUR PURPOSE:&nbsp; </strong>Safe kids, safe families, safe Calgary.</p><p><strong>OUR MANDATE:&nbsp; </strong>The Calgary Police Foundation is an independent entity that partners exclusively with the Calgary Police Service.

The love and support I received (and still receive 17 years later), surrounding my choice to place for open adoption, was necessary to get me through facing the pain of the loss of my son. I joined the Birth Mom&#39;s support group during my pregnancy, which I still attend to this day, where a lifelong bond developed with other beautiful strong women who have gone through the same thing that I did. We candidly share the heart felt pains and gains of our adoptions. We cry, grieve and support each other with total love and understanding. Without the CPCC, I really don&#39;t know how my life would have played out--if I had not received the unconditional love that I did, even though I felt I didn&#39;t deserve it. As hard as it was for me to reach out and ask for help at the time, I had to put my pride aside and just pick up the phone and dial, because there are some things in life you can&#39;t go through alone!</p><p>- Calgary Pregnancy Care Centre Client</p><p>I was working as a volunteer for CPCC when I found out that my own 15-year old daughter was pregnant. We instantly became clients, and both my daughter and I received individual counselling and support from the moment we expressed a need. They stayed involved with us throughout the entire experience, and we are both still friends with our counselors. My daughter delivered her son almost nine years ago. They offer practical help (like maternity and baby clothes) and emotional support (helping everyone cope with the upcoming changes).

She has set up three different areas at home with bookshelves and comfortable seating so that her children can escape into a book whenever they want. At Calgary Reads we call literate-rich environments like she described &lsquo;Reading Places&rsquo;.</p><p>At <strong>Calgary Reads</strong>, we help get books into the hands of Calgary children who have few or none of their own. Access to books is important because children need to grow up with lots of books to build their brains, develop language skills, get ready for school and to become lifelong readers. A 20-year study across 27 countries found that the &ldquo;mere presence of books&rdquo; profoundly impacts a child&rsquo;s school achievement. Yet in low income neighbourhoods there can be as few as one book for every 300 children. Yes, you read that right . . . and it means that thousands of children in Calgary have not a single book to write their name inside; which also means they can&rsquo;t keep the book forever, or reread it over and over again until it becomes their cherished favourite.</p>"	"public://org_profile/news1_0.jpg"	"Young girl reading at a table"	"If children aren’t confident readers by Grade 3, statistics indicate they may never catch up."	"<p>Calgary Reads is an early-literacy initiative. Our vision is of a community where all children read with confidence and joy!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Our work is needed because:</strong></p><ul><li>49% of adult Canadians have low literacy skills</li><li>Alberta&rsquo;s high school completion rate of 75% is one of the lowest in Canada</li><li>29% of Alberta&rsquo;s children arrive at Kindergarten without the strong foundation they need to be successful</li></ul><p>It takes all of us (parents, schools and the community) to help children read with confidence and joy because children spend 900 hours in school and 7,800 outside school each year.&nbsp;</p><p>While teachers care about reading and help children learn to read, they have lots of responsibilities and competing priorities. Teachers have busy, full classrooms and sometimes children that are under-prepared for school&mdash;or, falling behind. We work closely with teachers to decide which children will most benefit from our programs. And, one teacher in each school (where we are active) becomes the coordinator who works closely with us to implement Calgary Reads&rsquo; programs, initiatives and events with their students and school families.</p><p>Calgary Reads began in 1998 as an early-literacy initiative. Our founders identified the need for reading help in the early grades. And, we are still the only in-school, one-on-one tutor program with trained volunteers. We&rsquo;ve grown of course. Today, Calgary Reads has lots of effective programs, initiatives, events, resources and professional learning opportunities. We&rsquo;re a vibrant&nbsp;multifaceted reading movement!&nbsp;</p><p>Sadly too, many children in Calgary have no or few books in their homes; we know that access to quality print materials and books is essential to help children build their reading skills and develop a love of books and learning. So, we also help get books into the hands of children who would love to have their own.</p><p>Our work is critical because literacy is linked to a range of personal, social and financial benefits, from positive self-esteem to ongoing employment, good health, community engagement, reduced crime rates and even a stronger national economy. Calgary Reads is becoming part of the provincial literacy landscape, bridging&nbsp;<a href=""http://calgaryreads.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Alberta-Reads-Network-January-2015-1.pdf"" target=""_blank"">the great divide</a>&nbsp;between&nbsp;home and school.</p><p>So:&nbsp; we work with schools, the community, post-secondary institutions, business partners and volunteers &ndash; because we all have a part to play in helping children become confident and joyful readers!&nbsp;</p><p>Watch our <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2LdLmYa0Rg"" target=""_blank"">Read Aloud</a> video and learn more about the power of reading aloud with the children in your life.&nbsp;</p>"	"public://org_profile/C-Reads Pink Reader Big Dec 17_0.JPG"	"Young girl shown with a book open on her lap."	"Reading for as little as 6 minutes is sufficient to reduce stress levels by 60%."	"<p>In addition to our programs, collaborative events, initiatives and services &ndash; we stimulate a &lsquo;reading revival&rsquo; movement.</p><p>We are most well-known for our signature in school one-on-one tutoring program <strong>Read Up!</strong> that pairs trained volunteer tutors with a struggling reader in Grade 1 or 2. This tutoring occurs regularly over several weeks. It&rsquo;s active in lots of schools. Children work with their tutor long-term to reach their appropriate reading level or beyond! As their reading skill develops, so too does their confidence. Most of the tutored children no longer fear reading; they are avid book lovers, seek out new material and start to recommend stories and nonfiction topics to their friends (and tutor!).</p><p>Our <strong>wee read</strong> program has employee teams, and other volunteers trained to read aloud and have conversations with (the same) Kindergarten children, once a week for eight weeks. This is a gem of a program because the training is quick and easy for volunteers and the pleasure for them and the children, so immediate. Imagine little ones who are rarely read to at home. Or, perhaps not read to in English. They have this wonderfully keen &lsquo;new friend&rsquo; who comes regularly to read and talk about stories. It&rsquo;s the perfect early stage to help children see reading and books as a time of great pleasure, caring and learning. Last year almost 3,000 Kindergarten children were read to regularly by 905 trained volunteers including 539 high school students! Now these Kindergarten children are ready for Grade 1 and prepared to build their reading and learning skills.</p><p>Our <strong>Read Every Day That you Eat</strong> initiative is a collaborative project with the Calgary Food Bank. Together, we get books into the hands of children who have none or few of their own. Our Literacy Coaches, regularly on site at the Calgary Food Bank, share reading tips and resources with parents and caregivers so they can help their children with reading at home. And, we invite children to pick their own books from age-appropriate quality ones we provide. It helps each child bond to the book they choose and be keen to read it, or have it read to them. Often we read aloud to a child too! Community members and corporate partners support this work by holding book drives and donating new and like-new books for children age 0-8 to us.</p><p>Our <strong>Literacy-in-a-Box</strong> modules help teachers implement fun, family literacy nights at school. The various themes and activities help build literacy skills, school community, and share ideas with parents too.</p><p>Calgary Reads <strong>Reading Rally</strong> events in schools are large scale celebrations of reading. Groups of volunteers read aloud to small groups of children and a special guest reader shares a story with everyone. Teachers perform a Readers Theatre too. Watch our <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldp6syOLAGQ"" target=""_blank"">video</a> &nbsp;and see members of the Calgary Police Service sharing their love of reading and books!</p><p>We provide <strong>Learning Opportunities</strong> for teachers and pre-service educators too. We bring in literacy experts, thought-leaders and other teachers doing great work to help children read with confidence and joy. Our attendees tell us how they value the new research and creative techniques and the opportunity to network and share best practices with their peers.</p><p>And, out in the community we have volunteers who help us drop free books for children and families to find, enjoy and keep or share with others. We also host Random Acts of Reading out on the street &ndash; so we can share the love of books and inspire others to read . . . especially with the children in their lives. We also make resources available on our website to parents, caregivers, teachers and tutors.</p>"	"public://profiles/CR logo 300x300.jpg"	"Calgary Reads logo"	"Calgary Reads logo"	"<p>Imagine reading aloud to a small child and seeing their eyes open wide in amazement. You get to share the delight as they talk with you and imagine what comes next in the story or laugh as the hero takes a spill. You may find you revisit your childhood reading memories, to talk about favourite stories and help children discover the wonder of books.</p><p>It&rsquo;s so meaningful too, to know you are inspiring a young reader. Perhaps you&rsquo;ll help them build their skills for reading. Or, show them that books are such a source of pleasure and new discovery. Imagine becoming a &lsquo;new friend&rsquo; to a small child who rarely has someone spend quality time just with them.</p><p>-----</p><p>There are so many ways you can join us and help! Of course, we do seek funding for our programs and operations and to help us expand our reach and impact.</p><p>The volunteer opportunities with us are wonderful too!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And, if you want to do other things to help us &ndash; you can.

Or bring a group and help us in the office prepare materials . . . and be part of Book Drops or Random Acts of Reading in the community.</p><p>We can promise you&rsquo;ll have fun helping us, you&rsquo;ll make a difference in children&rsquo;s lives and we will be so grateful!&nbsp;</p><p>Our website details many one-time, short-term and long-term volunteer opportunities and shares ways to donate.

Over the course of a year he has lost $21,000 in scam emails, calls and letters. The bank representative that Frank dealt had completed the online SeniorConnect training that we offer at Calgary Seniors&rsquo; Resource Society. It only takes about 30 minutes, but it teaches participants how to recognize the signs and symptoms of a senior who may need assistance. As a result of the training, the bank knew to call the Seniors&rsquo; Help Line and report their concerns. </em></p><p><em>As a result of that call, a SeniorConnect social worker was dispatched to Frank&rsquo;s house and completed an assessment.

We end senior isolation in our city as our clients have little or no family or friends in the city able or willing to assist them. Some of our clients are of an income level that they cannot afford to pay for services from for-profit organizations providing similar programs. If you or someone you love meets these eligibility requirements or wish to discuss your eligibility further with our staff please read on to learn about the programs and services we offer.</p><p><strong>Christmas Cheer Up &nbsp;</strong>Our annual Christmas program ensures isolated seniors do not spend the holidays alone. With a stockingfull of gifts and a visit from a volunteer over the holiday season we bring joy and caring to a senior&rsquo;s home to let them know they are not forgotten.</p><p><strong>Spring Clean Up/Fall Fix Up &nbsp;</strong>Spring Clean Up engages volunteer groups to help seniors with cleaning and light landscaping projects around their home. Fall Fix Up ensures seniors who need small renovation projects completed get the help they need.Working with corporate partners and local home builders we ensure that all renovations are completed by trained professionals. These projects help maintain seniors&rsquo; homes, keep them safe and inspire pride in our communities.</p><p><strong><a href=""http://www.calgaryseniors.org/services-and-programs/friendly-visiting"">Friendly Visiting</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Our companionship program matches a senior with a caring volunteer who visits once a week for an hour.

The volunteers provide more than transportation, helping the senior as they shop and with putting awaytheir items when they return home. As well as offering critical transportation for the senior, the program also offers social support. These bi-weekly visits are something they look forward to as a wonderful opportunity to spend time witha friend.</p><p><a href=""http://www.calgaryseniors.org/services-and-programs/telephone-reassurance""><strong>Telephone Reassurance &nbsp;</strong></a>Seniors are matched one on one with a volunteer who will phone regularly at an agreed upon time to provide afriendly voice, willing ear and of course, peace of mind that someone will be checking in.</p><p><a href=""http://www.calgaryseniors.org/services-and-programs/escorted-transportation""><strong>Escorted Transportation &nbsp;</strong></a>Seniors are provided with round trip, arm in arm rides to medical appointments from volunteers.

The senior pays a $10 gas recovery fee for every ride.</p><p><strong>Pet Assist &nbsp;</strong>The correlation between a high quality of life and owning a pet cannot be underestimated, a need that is often overlooked.&nbsp; This program provides volunteers to assist isolated and low income seniors with their pet care needs.&nbsp; This might include weight management, exercise, monitoring medication and other treatment and providing support during and after vet visits.</p><p><strong>Take Care Be Aware! &nbsp;</strong>The focus of Take Care, Be Aware! Is to educate seniors about the realities of fraud and financial abuse, and what steps they can take to protect themselves.&nbsp; Using a &ldquo;seniors helping seniors&rdquo; model, volunteers will present information on current frauds, red flags to watch for, tips for prevention and host an interactive conversation with the group.</p><p><strong>Information and Referral &nbsp;</strong>Seniors and their families can call Calgary Seniors for information and referrals to community resources andservices available to them in Calgary.

It was clear from the moment I walked in the door that there would be lots to talk about this week.&nbsp;</p><p>Willie and Ralph, long time friends, were sitting opposite each other. Willie, sitting alone next to me, was accused of spreading false rumors about Ralph and a girl. Ralph was with the other boys sitting as judge and jury.</p><p>The boys are negotiating the powerful feelings that accompany right and wrong, afraid to be vulnerable, to be seen as weak. They want to repair their friendship but don&rsquo;t know how to without losing face. Heck I&rsquo;m twice their age and it&rsquo;s still hard for me.</p><p>While I&rsquo;m sitting there, trying to keep order, this situation seems all too familiar. I&rsquo;m the participant observer of my own stubbornness, the facade of strength and righteousness that leaves little space to listen and no room for empathy.</p><p>As I move from observer to facilitator everything begins to shift. Feeling words start to emerge &ndash; &ldquo;I feel frustrated, angry, pissed-off.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s no longer about who&rsquo;s right or wrong, this is about how it feels to be in a fight with your friend.</p><p>As the two boys talk about their feelings, anger and fear give way to understanding. &nbsp;Willie recognizes that his actions have hurt his friend. He comes to appreciate Ralph&rsquo;s anger and in the safety of our meeting he apologizes. He opens up to the group and admits that sometimes he talks without thinking and that he&rsquo;s working on it.</p><p>In that moment of honesty and vulnerability Ralph says, &ldquo;I accept your apology and we can be friends again, but I just might not talk to you for a while.&rdquo;</p><p>Ten minutes later they are laughing and joking together in class.</p><p>How many times have I fought with someone I cared about, focused on defending my position and ignoring their feelings? &nbsp;I wish I had had someone to facilitate these conversations, to help me to see the hurt and share my feelings, to repair my friendships.</p><p>Calgary Sexual Health sees the value of creating safer spaces for people to share, be curious, and show empathy towards each other.

"769"	"Calgary Silver Linings Foundation"	"3"	"<p>It started innocuously enough &ndash; some leftover food on her plate at dinner, an extra work out here and there. Only it didn&rsquo;t end there. It hasn&rsquo;t ended.</p><p>Eventually, my teenage daughter, Madison, wasted away to a mere 90 pounds from restricted eating and obsessive over exercising. With a heart rate of 32 beats per minute, my beautiful, brilliant girl collapsed and was rushed to the emergency department at the Foothills Hospital. After a 52-hour stay in the emergency department with no available hospital bed, she was diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa and I was told she would need to be hospitalized.</p><p>Devastatingly, there were no beds available in the Eating Disorder (ED) program. Instead, my 16 year old was admitted to the psychiatric ward at the Rockyview Hospital where she received little support for her eating disorder and was released 5 days later. &nbsp;This cycle repeated itself three more times.</p><p>Finally, a bed opened up in the ED Program where Madison spent the following six weeks becoming medically stable, meaning that while she was no longer in immediate risk of dying, her illness raged on untreated.</p><p>After trying every locally available avenue for treatment, it became apparent that Madison needed more intensive treatment than what was currently being offered. We sought treatment outside of province, where Madison lived in a residential treatment centre for six months. I followed her, of course, quitting my job, trusting that my other child would be fine without me. I rented an apartment close to the treatment centre.</p><p>My lost income, my daughter&rsquo;s medical fees, our expenses relocating for six months - none of this was covered through her medical insurance, but I was desperate to help Madison overcome this deadly disease before it overcame her and our family.&nbsp; The financial costs exceeded $150,000. The emotional costs remain immeasurable.</p><p>After maneuvering through the various channels of the health care system, I met many other parents dealing with the same issues.&nbsp; Some of their children had managed to recover through residential treatment outside the province, most were still caught up in the endless cycle of hospital readmissions and temporary stabilization. The parents of male patients had horror stories beyond even what I could imagine.</p><p>In 2014, these passionate, like-minded parents, who had been through similar heart-wrenching and difficult journeys, joined to form the Calgary Silver Linings Foundation to address current systemic gap in Alberta in treating eating disorders. Our goal is to establish Alberta&rsquo;s first residential treatment centre for eating disorders to ensure other families have easier, more affordable and faster access to treatment for their children. Our goal is to save lives.</p><p>The name of the foundation reflects the hope that the process of recovery and family therapy, personal foundations and relationships can become stronger and patients and their families can recover &ndash; with the proper treatment. Although&nbsp;sometimes difficult to see, there is a silver lining in this journey. A residential treatment centre for Albertans can provide those families caught in the nightmare of trying to save their child from the mental illness with the highest mortality rate with a silver lining &ndash; a locally based, affordable treatment program for their children.&nbsp;</p>"	"public://org_profile/CFC_1.png"	"Raising Awareness & Support for Eating Disorders in Alberta"	"Calgary Silver Linings Foundation"	"<p>The Calgary Silver Linings Foundation (CSLF) is working collaboratively to create a world-class residential eating disorder treatment centre in Alberta and to bridge the gap in accessibility and care of eating disorders.</p><p>More than 30,000 Albertans (male and female) suffer from eating disorders, with no specialized provincial residential treatment facility for the illness. Calgary Silver Linings Foundation is the only Alberta foundation working towards the establishment of the province&rsquo;s first eating disorder residential treatment centre in Southern Alberta.</p><p>Many Alberta youth suffer from severe eating disorders and building a residential treatment centre in Southern Alberta for at-risk youth is the first critical step in filling the systemic gap in services and reducing the number of repeat hospital admissions and deaths. The rate of girls between 10-19 years-old who had to be hospitalized from 2007-2013 increased by 42%. More than one-quarter of hospital emergency visits in Alberta for eating disorders include an admission to hospital for inpatient care and the average stay in hospital is 33 days. Eating disorders have the highest risk of mortality of any mental illness and residential treatment is necessary to break the cycle of hospital readmissions.</p><p>There are only four specialized residential treatment centres in Canada and most no longer accept out-of-province patients, leaving Alberta parents the limited option of going for treatment in the U.S., often unfeasible for many families. Treatment takes an average of three to six months. &nbsp;</p><p>Shortly after setting up the foundation, the Board of Directors organized an open house with the community of people affected directly by an eating disorder. This community conversation validated their intent as a priority of the community.</p><p>Donations to CSLF will go directly towards the capital costs associated with building Alberta&rsquo;s first residential treatment centre for eating disorders, including site purchase or leasehold improvements of a partner and program design.</p>"	"public://org_profile/sky.jpeg"	""	""	"<p><strong>1.

From our humble beginnings in a church basement, we have grown over the last 36-years to become a vital hub for both emerging and established filmmakers working in Calgary.</p><p>When the $100 Film Festival was born in 1992, it showcased eight short films on Super 8. The name sprung from the challenge to shoot a short film on four rolls of Super 8 &ndash; which tallied to the cost of $100.

She was living at an addictions recovery facility, which she would have to leave once her child was born. Her family had disowned her and she was avoiding her friends as they were all associated with a lifestyle she was fighting to leave behind. Time was passing quickly, where would she and her newborn go?</p><p>Lisa had struggled with drug and alcohol addictions for almost 10 years. As a young teenager, she had been sexually assaulted, an event that had consequences into her adult life. By 20, she was in a highly dysfunctional and abusive relationship. She stayed in it for almost 7 years, turning to drugs and alcohol to cope. The relationship ended and other abusive relationships took its place. By then, Lisa was entrenched in a pattern of addiction and crisis followed by sobriety and relapse.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;I got lost somewhere along the way. I was a mess.&rdquo;</strong></p><p>Finding out that she was pregnant jarred Lisa out of her patterns. She quit drinking and using as soon as she found that she was pregnant. When the baby&rsquo;s father wouldn&rsquo;t commit to doing the same and was not supportive, she left him and lost her apartment. She also lost one of her two minimum wage jobs due to medical complications with her pregnancy. Clean and sober, her life remained filled with uncertainty and struggle, but she was determined to get her act together before her child was born.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;I was desperate. I didn&rsquo;t know where to go or what to do. CUPS worked a miracle for me. I felt blessed that day.&rdquo;</strong></p><p>CUPS Housing found subsidized housing for Lisa through a partner agency. At <a href=""http://cupscalgary.com/family-development-centre-program/"">CUPS Family Development Centre</a>, Lisa signed up for an intensive parenting program. When she found out about CUPS voluntary drug testing program for pre-natal women at the <a href=""http://cupscalgary.com/health-services/"">Women&rsquo;s Health Clinic</a>, she moved her medical care to CUPS. Lisa had no idea how these positive choices were going to impact her in the very near future.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;If you can believe it, I was so excited about the drug testing. It would help keep me accountable.&rdquo;</strong></p><p>Lisa was housed 2 months before her baby was due. With no family contact and still avoiding former friends, she was very isolated. For many addicts, isolation is enough to trigger a relapse, but Lisa remained determined.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;It was easier being alone than even having one person around who wasn&rsquo;t a positive influence. I kept so busy working, being in pain, being tired.&rdquo;</strong></p><p>Towards the end of her pregnancy, Lisa worked hard to reconnect with her parents; this was another choice that she didn&rsquo;t yet know the full consequences of. Initially, they were very wary and not impressed with her unexpected pregnancy, but they opened themselves to her and their unborn grandchild.</p><p>Soon after, Lisa delivered a healthy baby. At the hospital, she had packed her things, her newborn was in a car seat ready to go and her parents were waiting to drive them home. She was told that a social worker was coming to see her, a normal procedure she thought, but the meeting kept being delayed. When the social worker finally arrived, Lisa was happy to see her and to be that much closer to going home, until she was informed that the woman worked for Child and Family Services and was there to apprehend her child.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;I went to hospital in labour. I was doing all the right things. I&rsquo;d been clean and sober for almost 8 months. Then they showed up to take my baby away.&rdquo;</strong></p><p>Lisa was stunned. She had not been expecting Child and Family Services involvement, much less for her baby to be apprehended. She was told that she had been flagged due to the baby&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s suspected criminal activity and she was told facts about his past that she had been completely unaware of.</p><p>Three hours of intensive interviewing of Lisa and her parents followed. Lisa relayed what she had undertaken: getting clean and sober as soon as she discovered that she was pregnant, leaving the unsupportive father, getting into a addictions recovery facility, finding safe and suitable housing for herself and her child, working with CUPS, undergoing voluntary drug testing throughout her pregnancy, registering to attend CUPS parenting program, re-establishing a relationship with her parents and working to regain their trust, and no longer associating with anyone involved in her previous lifestyle. It was agreed that she would also begin counselling and join a relapse prevention group.</p><p>Finally, Lisa and her baby got to go home, but not to their home. An order had been placed; Lisa and her baby would have to stay with her parents.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;I was really working hard to get my life together. I had done it all by myself, and then my parents had to step up yet again to help me out. I did it all on my own, but the only way I could keep my child was to rely on my parents.&rdquo;</strong></p><p>Following confirmation of Lisa&rsquo;s claims and drug test results and further interviewing, Lisa retained guardianship of her child, but was mandated to stay with her parents for the next 6 months.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;I said to myself, you know what, you put yourself here whichever way you look at it. Even though I was doing well now, look at my past. My child was with me, not gone, not with somebody else. So I couldn&rsquo;t really complain. There was no reason for me to complain. I can&rsquo;t just sit there and be mad at the world. It all starts with me.&rdquo;</strong></p><p>The 6 months passed without incident and Lisa and her baby were allowed to leave her parents&rsquo; house and finally move into her apartment. Lisa completed 8 months of counselling with a focus on cognitive therapy, which she found very helpful. Her relationship with her parents continued to strengthen. She finished with her relapse group and joined a trauma group. She graduated from<a href=""http://cupscalgary.com/the-power-of-cups-nurturing-parenting-program/""> CUPS&rsquo; Nurturing Parenting Program</a> and feels that the program taught and supported her a great deal in her role as a new mother.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made a lot of changes, a lot more than I ever did before. You have to be really serious about making changes, 150% committed. You have to change everything. I&rsquo;ve heard that a million times before, from past addicts, from agencies, from people. Now I know it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</strong></p><p>Lisa applied for <a href=""http://cupscalgary.com/lorraine-melchior-bursary-fund/"">CUPS Lorraine Melchior Bursary Fund</a> and returned to school to upgrade with the intention of then attending university. Knowing that she would either need to return to work or go to school, Lisa wisely put her child on a nursery school waiting list last year. Lisa has completely changed her life and defined a new future for herself. CUPS Bursary Fund will assist with child care costs and groceries for the next year or so. After that, Lisa will probably be fully incorporated into mainstream society and no longer require CUPS&rsquo; assistance.</p><p>Lisa arrived at CUPS highly motivated. She was ready to engage with any programs that would support her desire to change her life. With CUPS&rsquo; support, Lisa has achieved her goal and is well on her way to realizing her potential as an individual, a daughter and a mother. As a supporter of CUPS, you are also responsible for changing Lisa and her child&rsquo;s lives for the better. In supporting CUPS, you have made a new and brighter future possible for Lisa and her child.

To rescue and provide appropriate veterinary based care and treatment to injured and orphaned wildlife with the goal of releasing vigorous individuals capable of successfully returning to their natural habitat. &nbsp;</em></strong></p><p>The Calgary Wildlife Rehabilitation Society rescues injured and orphaned wildlife in Calgary and the surrounding area. Animals are either rescued by our team of volunteers, are brought to us by the public, come through Calgary 311 services, or are filtered through local veterinary clinics. Once onsite, the animals are medically examined by our trained wildlife technicians (RAHT or B. Sc), overseen by our staff veterinarian, and an appropriate course of treatment is implemented. Animals are kept at our facility until they are deemed medically fit by our staff veterinarian to be released back into the wild. An appropriate locale is carefully selected by the staff and all healthy individuals are released back into their natural habitat. Migratory animals are kept until the appropriate time of year. Animals unable to be released due to the severity of injuries sustained are euthanized or kept as education ambassadors.&nbsp;</p><p>The Calgary Wildlife Rehabilitation Society works closely with Sustainable Resource Development to ensure that all animals are being taken care of appropriately. We are an accredited organization (Alberta Veterinary Medical Association) and do not charge for our services.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>2. To provide relevant public education and outreach to schools and other community groups through presentations, visits, displays and literature</em>. &nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Calgary Wildlife Rehabilitation Society provides education programs to the public, including schools, seniors&rsquo; residences, libraries, fairs, festivals, The Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Ronald McDonald&rsquo;s House and other appropriate venues. The Education program serves to inform the public about our services, address conservation issues and provide information about native wildlife. Our educators volunteer their time, donating thousands of hours a year to the hundreds of programs that we book. When appropriate, an education ambassador is sent as part of the education program. We currently have 3 education ambassadors: Lito (Swainson&rsquo;s Hawk), Oberon (Great Horned Owl) and Ophelia (Great Horned Owl). Each of these animals was brought to the center injured and due to the severity of the injury could not be successfully released back into the wild.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>3. To maintain connections with other local organizations whose primary interest is wildlife, environmental conservation and related public education </em></strong></p><p>The Calgary Wildlife Rehabilitation Society maintains working relationships with the Cochrane Ecological Society, Medicine River Wildlife Center, the Alberta Wilderness Association and other similar organizations. We actively maintain communication with such organizations and will transport animals to their facilities under the direction of Sustainable Resource Development when it is in the best interest of our wildlife patients.&nbsp;</p><p>CWRS has been asked to give talks about wildlife and conservation at the Marda Loop Justice Film Festival and for Nature Calgary. CWRS is invited every year to host a booth at Bow Habitat Station, a local fish hatchery and nature interpretive center. These are just a few examples of other local organizations with which CWRS maintains a positive and collaborative partnership.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>4. To provide volunteer opportunities and service to the community by making available a venue for members, service groups, and volunteer minimum-security inmates to contribute to a community service while acquiring new skills. &nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Calgary Wildlife Rehabilitation Society has a roster of over 200 active volunteers who contribute to the functioning of our society. These volunteers are members of our society. Volunteers help with animal care (cleaning cages and feeding animals), pickups/rescues (picking up animals at veterinary clinics or rescuing animals that are injured), education (running education programs in schools, seniors residences and other public relations events) and as board members.&nbsp;</p><p>Minimum Security inmates volunteer their time, under supervision, to help with site maintenance.&nbsp;</p><p>Service groups volunteer their time to help with construction projects.</p>"	"public://profiles/DSC_0030medium.jpg"	""	"An orphaned skunk receiving care"	"<p>We receive no direct governement funding and must rely on donations to raise the money required for food, housing, medical supplies and our staff of six.

Sally spoke of her husband of 10 years constantly calling her names, tracking her movements within their town and recently becoming physically aggressive with her in front of their children. She commented on her husband&rsquo;s love of hunting and his recent concerns she was cheating on him.</p><p>She had her children hidden under a blanket in the backseat with their family dog, bags in the trunk she had packed months before and all their legal documents hidden in her pant leg from that morning. The helpline counselor asked Sally where she was and then connected with the local police to ensure she and her children were able to leave their family farm with the protection the situation required. Police were on their way to formally escort the family to safety.</p><p>A formal assessment around the extent of the abuse and safety precautions Sally had taken over the years brought forward her resistance to violence and ability to protect her family in the most desperate of times. Next the counselor was able to connect with the local pet care program so the family&#39;s dog would be well cared for during this time of crisis.

Amy was taking some classes at an outreach high school, but life circumstances and choices were weighing heavily on her; she was struggling. Drugs and alcohol were a problem and she was partying a lot, she had behavioral challenges and was was skipping out on school, she had unhealthy relationships and an unplanned pregnancy.</p><p>Her mom was at a loss, saying that Amy had no hope, no direction, and was generally very unhappy. She was worried. Then a glimpse of hope appeared on what she calls &ldquo;&hellip;the day that everything changed. Amy came home from school in a good mood (emphasizing that good moods were not common for her). She was excited to say that she was nominated for a leadership program because a teacher at school thought she was a leader with a potential.&rdquo;</p><p>Imagine, as a mom, how she must have felt that day &ndash; Amy wasn&#39;t&rsquo;t referred to a program because someone saw another problem that needed to be fixed; this time it was a special spark in her daughter that earned her a spot in an innovative program called &ldquo;In the Lead&rdquo;.</p><p>It took a while for things to shift for Amy. But slowly, with a relentless focus on her strengths, she began to believe them and use them in new and promising ways. She was developing leadership characteristics in weekly classes where the facilitator led engaging conversations with her peers, she was connected with a Volunteer Coach who helped to mentor Amy through her journey, and she was giving back to the community through group volunteer events.</p><p>She became outspoken, using her voice to stand up for herself and others. She was independent, strong-willed, and engaged. She had focus and ambition. Her mom says it best &ndash; &ldquo;when Amy was in the program she became more positive, more confident and more at ease. She was happy, she had hope&hellip;her light was back, I could see it in her eyes. She is now on a journey to becoming the person she was meant to be.&rdquo;</p><p>This is only one story of one youth in one program at Calgary Youth Justice Society, but the great news is that Amy is among 400 youth every year who are given a chance to change, and do. Even still, there are too many overlooked young people in our community, like Amy, who are waiting for someone to notice what&rsquo;s strong instead of what&rsquo;s wrong.</p><p>Remember those characteristics that Amy used to be known for&hellip; cocky, opinionated, angry and defiant?

The program is tailor-made to each youth, has a high level of collaboration with the justice system and community partners, and retains long-serving volunteers who deliver a professional service.&nbsp;Youth often say they now realize their own power and the opportunity to make a positive choice, they have a new idea of their role and responsibilities in a community, and they feel better about themselves as a result of the sanctions they were given. Sanctions are often chosen to fit the strengths, future plans, interests and current challenges of the young person before them.

"670"	"Calgary Zoological Society"	"3"	"<p>Connecting with nature is essential for protecting wildlife. The Calgary Zoo is that connection. We have endless stories to share about our animals who act as ambassadors for their species, our people and our conservation work.</p><p>Residents of the Wechiau Hippo Sanctuary Share Their Stories: &nbsp; It was a simple concept &ndash; create a sanctuary to save hippos &ndash; and over a decade ago, the Wechiau Community Hippo Sanctuary was founded to do just that. Nestled along the banks of the Upper Black Volta River in the northwest corner of Ghana, on the border with Burkina Faso, the sanctuary protects one of only two remaining hippo wallows in the entire country.</p><p>Living with Africa&rsquo;s most dangerous animals in your backyard wasn&rsquo;t easy. The hippos&rsquo; watery home was also a primary source of drinking water, and crops planted close to the river for easy irrigation were often eaten by hungry hippos at night. Conflicts between people and hippos were inevitable &ndash; something had to change.</p><p>In 1998, the chiefs and elders of 17 communities came together and embraced a new model of conservation that would protect the hippos and help their people. With help from the Calgary Zoo, two distinct zones were created along a 40-kilometre stretch of the river &ndash; one zone for humans and one for hippos. Boreholes were dug to provide fresh drinking water at seven sites throughout the sanctuary. Finally, hippos and people could peacefully co-exist.</p><p>---&nbsp;</p><p>The Calgary Zoo is more than just a place to see animals. Whether we are inspiring our visitors to love nature, saving species in western Canada from extinction or working with scientists on the other side of the globe, our ultimate goal is simple: to help wildlife and keep it wild. The successful care of endangered species in captivity and in the wild is not easy, but there is no alternative. Through education and exposure, we help our visitors understand and care about the natural world around us. We are proud to provide a place where visitors can learn about protecting the world around them while creating action and developing future conservationists.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"	"public://org_profile/Zoo Hippos Web Capture Janu 27 2015.PNG"	"Calgary Zoo Hippos in the water"	"Calgary Zoo Hippos in the water"	"<p>It&rsquo;s easy to get Calgary Zoo visitors excited about nature &ndash; you&nbsp; can&rsquo;t help but feel a connection with the amazing creatures that call the zoo home. We celebrate the magical moments that happen here to open people&rsquo;s hearts and minds, and help them take the next step &ndash; from recycling their cell phone to supporting conservation organizations.</p><p>We are passionate about conservation. And we know that it takes good science to successfully protect endangered species.&nbsp; Our dedicated biologists have supported and provided technical assistance to conservation projects in more than 20 countries. The zoo specializes in community-based conservation initiatives, one of which (Wechiau Community Hippo Sanctuary in Ghana, West Africa) received the UN&rsquo;s Equatorial Prize. Through the Husky Energy Endangered Species Program,&nbsp; we are recognized as a North American leader in the science of species reintroduction. Our team may come from diverse backgrounds, but have one thing in common &ndash; a passion&nbsp; for conserving our world&#39;s biodiversity.</p><p><strong>In Our Backyard:&nbsp;</strong>We are sharing our messages of hope and inspiration through our on-park experiences with our guests and encouraging them to make a difference in the world around them. Working with governments, non-profit organizations, specialists, industry and communities, our team of conservation biologists conduct groundbreaking scientific research. Some of the species we are studying include whooping cranes, swift foxes, northern leopard frog and black-tailed prairie dogs.</p><p><strong>Across the World:&nbsp;</strong>When committed communities get the support they need, the conservation results are truly inspiring. But communities in developing parts of the world must have a reason &ndash; largely economic &ndash; to protect wildlife. So we&nbsp;start by alleviating poverty: creating employment opportunities, focusing on education and improving the overall quality of life for community members. When people prosper, nature benefits.&nbsp;We choose projects that apply sound science, include local communities and have the greatest conservation impact. Then, we determine the best way we can help.</p><p><strong>2015 Highlights from the President and CEO:</strong></p><ul><li>To strengthen the appeal of the zoo, we introduced two new spectacular events, Dinosaurs Alive and ILLUMINASIA&nbsp;Lantern and Garden Festival. These provided our guests with an escape to a different world; a journey back in time when dinosaurs roamed the earth and an enchanting evening into the beauty and history of Chinese lantern making.</li></ul><ul><li><p>Our 1.3 million visitors, our second best attendance in the zoo&rsquo;s history, were treated to new and innovative experiences. We transformed some of our popular habitats to offer the next generation of conservationists&rsquo; new<br />ways to interact with our animals such as the new slide at the wolf habitat and the new viewing windows at the<br />Japanese macaques.</p></li><li><p>Thanks to everyone&rsquo;s hard work, the zoo ended 2015 in a positive financial position. As of December 31, 2015 we have put aside $3.5 million for future meaningful conservation activities in Canada and around the world, helping sustain wild animals and wild places.</p></li></ul><p><strong>2015 Donor Report:&nbsp;</strong>Over the past year, donors like you have made it possible to:</p><ul><li><p>...employ women from 17&nbsp;communities by opening a new&nbsp;shea butter processing factory at&nbsp;the Wechiau Community Hippo&nbsp;Sanctuary in Ghana, West Africa.</p></li><li><p>...conduct the 20th year of&nbsp;swift fox counting.

That number might sound low, but it&rsquo;s actually quite impressive. With help from the Calgary Zoo, whooping cranes have recovered from an all-time low of only 21 birds in the 1940s.</p><p>We are one of three major facilities &ndash; and Canada&rsquo;s only one - that breeds whooping cranes to increase the wild population. The birds that are hatched and reared in captivity are either released to the wild to bolster new populations or held back to supplement the breeding program.</p><p>The intricacies of going from whooping crane egg to migrating bird often seem endless and the road to reintroduction is complex. Projects like this depend on sound science to improve inseminating, incubating, hatching and monitoring of whooping cranes.</p><p>Each spring, about a week before the Calgary Zoo&rsquo;s whooping crane eggs hatch, they are whisked off by plane to one of two breeding facilities that we work with to save these magnificent birds. A zookeeper accompanies the precious cargo &ndash; anywhere from one egg up to as many as six &ndash; carrying them in a custom-made duffel bag equipped with its own incubator.</p><p>Under carefully controlled conditions, eggs are incubated, hatched and watched by attendants who wear white crane costumes to ensure that the fledglings do not imprint on humans. Once the chicks are capable of flight, they are either taught to migrate from Wisconsin, or some are released into a non-migratory flock.</p><p>We are like proud parents each time one of our birds is released back to Mother Nature, but we know that the population is still fragile. Our Calgary Zoo biologists are dedicated to the recovery of whooping cranes to ensure that this proud and mighty bird flies annually through the Alberta and Saskatchewan skies.</p><p><strong>Animal Care</strong></p><p>Providing world-class care to our animals involves the creation of natural habitat exhibits, engaging enrichment, knowledgeable zookeepers and an exceptional veterinary team. The Calgary Zoo is home to the best zoo and wildlife hospital in western Canada. In addition to caring for animals that are sick or injured, our dedicated veterinarian team provides preventative care for healthy animals, studies diseases, conducts conservation research and trains the next generation of zoo vets.</p><p>The Calgary Zoo participates in 26 Species Survival Plans and 49 Population Management Plans with the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) for species at risk or threatened with extinction. These programs protect the long-term genetics of the captive species creating sustainable &lsquo;insurance populations&rsquo; of animals.</p><p><strong>Community Based Conservation</strong></p><p>Saving species, protecting habitat and promoting sustainable living are worldwide challenges that require a global effort. The Calgary Zoo works around the world with an international network of colleagues to ensure maximum conservation impact, the application of sound science and the inclusion of local communities. In addition to scientific research, the zoo helps develop capacity in local communities to manage their own natural ecosystems in a way that both conserves wildlife and benefits local people.</p><p>The zoo&rsquo;s newest community-based conservation project is working with lemurs. We&#39;re setting our&nbsp;sights on the tree canopies of Madagascar, the only place in the world where lemurs are found in nature.&nbsp;Building on our success protecting eight endangered species across western Canada and our award winning work safeguarding hippos in Ghana,&nbsp;we&rsquo;re now expanding our efforts to help one of the world&rsquo;s most endangered primates.&nbsp;Our conservation model enables&nbsp;local communities to manage their own ecosystem in a way that both protects wildlife and benefits local people.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Educating the next generation of conservationists</strong></p><p>The Calgary Zoo connects people of all ages with nature through engaging educational programming. Understanding the natural world is a vital key to inspiring actions that promote conservation. By connecting&nbsp;over 1.2 million visitors of all ages&nbsp;with nature and sharing the conservation stories of our planet&rsquo;s most endangered species, the Calgary Zoo teaches about the challenges of our world today and how we can take action to create a brighter tomorrow.</p><p>Zoo education takes many forms, from formal classroom programs to hands-on exploration. Approximately 65,000 school children take part in formal zoo education programs and field trips every year - an incredible opportunity to engage the next generation. The zoo offers curriculum-based school programs for kindergarten to grade 12, generating excitement about nature and inspiring students to be conservation stewards.&nbsp;Education builds a legacy for future generations &ndash; a love of nature and a commitment to conservation.</p>"	"public://profiles/DSC_1879.JPG"	"Education program inspires conservation stewards"	"Education program inspires conservation stewards"	"<p>As you can tell by the picture above, Riley really loves lemurs!

"382"	"Canadian Centre for Male Survivors of Child Sexual Abuse (cc4ms)"	"3"	"<p>1 in 6 men - or more - has been a victim of childhood sexual abuse before the age of 18. &nbsp;For women, it&rsquo;s 1 in 3 before the age of 18. There are 323 assault centres in Canada, primarily for women and children.</p><p>For men? There are<em> four (4) dedicated treatment centres </em>- Victoria, Vancouver, Ottawa and Montreal &ndash; therefore, none on the prairies nor in the northern territories. These four centres provide excellent service but are unable to fulfill the demand. Most survivors, therefore, are left to dull their pain and shame through addictions - substance abuse, gambling, sex, violence and work. Many men simply try to forget the rape because they are told in many ways to &lsquo;get over it&rsquo;.</p><p>Survivors of this childhood trauma also have to cope with the devastating effects of betrayal because, in&nbsp;94% of the&nbsp;cases, it was someone the children knew and trusted who raped and traumatized them. As a result, most survivors don&rsquo;t disclose the crime for 20 years during which time the pain leads to depression, anger, anxiety, sleeplessness, homelessness and often, suicide.</p><p>Before healing can start, disclosure must happen. Before disclosure can happen, a survivor must realize that healing is possible and that he can access it. He needs to know that there are people, including professionals, who are eager and able to help him recover.</p>"	"public://org_profile/HHH-logo-CKC.jpg"	"Canadian Centre for Male Survivors of Child Sexual Abuse"	"cc4ms"	"<table border=""1"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0""><tbody><tr><td><p>Since the spring of 2012, cc4ms has operated as a referral agency.

As well, they have agreed to help us build a world-class dedicated treatment centre here in Calgary. In May 2015, we organized our first annual Bringing Healing! Treatment Training Seminar which 20 therapists attended.&nbsp; Sessions were led by two of the founders who have created three of the four dedicated treatment centres. Currently, we are working with nine therapists (six females/three males) and recruiting even more. We also intend to establish standards and qualification for therapists working in this area.</p><p>As well, we have partnered with twelve well-respected community organizations such as Southern Alberta HIV Clinic, AIDS Calgary, Simon House, Fresh START, 1835, John Howard Society, Jewish Family Services, of Calgary, the Distress Centre, Calgary Police Service as well as the Wellness Centres of our three post-secondary institutions. These partners are experts in their fields but trust cc4ms to help their survivors.</p><p>Evidence-based holistic programs are being developed and clients are evaluated both before and during treatment to ensure they are receiving appropriate and effective therapy.</p><p>------&nbsp;</p><p>Protocols and outcomes are determined by our Clinical Care Coordinator in conjunction with our Treatment Advisory Council (TAC) composed of multidisciplinary practitioners familiar with childhood sexual assault, therapy and trauma informed practices as they pertain to men.

Furthermore, we recognize that healing takes different paths and lengths of time so we are client sensitive.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Education:</strong> Bringing awareness of this situation, that 1 in 6 of Canadian men under the age of 18 has been sexually abused, is an important step towards healing and greater understanding leading to support.</li><li><strong>Advocacy:</strong> Generally, male survivors have been left to advocate for themselves. We will work with other groups in this field so that survivors have a strong, clear voice.&nbsp; As well, we will advocate that offenders are more appropriately handled in the light of this very serious crime and the lack of rehabilitation prospects.</li><li><strong>Research:</strong> Very little research has been produced in Canada concerning AMS of CSA - or indeed, child sexual abuse.

"562"	"Canadian Mental Health Association - Calgary Region"	"3"	"<p>The reality for many people dealing with mental health challenges, is that they have adopted a mask &ndash; one that camouflages the threads of shame, misunderstanding, and sometimes loneliness.</p><p>But in Calgary that is changing, thanks to the Peer Options programs at CMHA. Here, the peer movement has moved into plain sight for everyone to see!</p><p>With the various Peer Options programs to choose from, each curriculum provides individuals a concrete understanding of building healthy relationships and creates a safe place to share with fellow peers their lived experience who are now focused on wellness and recovery just like them.</p><p>There are four different streams for Peer Options including, Art of Friendship, Community Art of Friendship, Community Circle of Friends and Welcome Wednesdays. In each program, peers have the opportunity to set personal recovery goals, connect with the community, build self-awareness and apply effective recovery tools to live their best quality of life.</p><p>Many graduates of the Peer Options programs give back through peer leadership offering inspiration, understanding, mentorship and hope.</p><p>This especially rings true for two peer advocates at the CMHA Calgary office &ndash; both graduates of Peer Options now supporting others who are reaching out for help.</p><p>Catherine MacAllister, is a 21 year old peer in the Calgary main office, who moved from Ireland as a teen. She recalls suffering from anorexia and using other unhealthy coping mechanisms to silence her demons of demeaning self-talk and feelings of isolation and loneliness. Just seconds from the gym doorsteps, she received an alarming phone call from her doctor that she must retreat immediately from any workouts, as her heart beat was too low. That was the turning point for Catherine. &ldquo;It was either get help or be consumed entirely by my thoughts, and for my own sake and sanity I reached out&rdquo; she says about her decision to make the positive changes she required to begin her road to recovery.</p><p>With similar heritage of English and Welsh descent, Donna Shukys too is a peer advocate at CMHA Calgary. After graduating as a peer support specialist, Donna volunteered with the Community Education team at the CMHA where she was introduced to the peer options program. &ldquo;I had gone through a lot of change in my life and it was too much for me to process and move through. My anxiety levels ran high and my depression was hard to manage. Once an overachiever, it all became a blur&rdquo; she explains.</p><p>Both Catherine and Donna maintain that there is a fine line between feeling supported and feeling pitied after breaking the silence of suffering from mental health concerns.</p><p>While some members of the community applaud and connect on a different level because of the honesty, others turn a blind eye and begin to treat you differently &ndash; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s as though there&rsquo;s an &lsquo;us&rsquo; and a &lsquo;them&rsquo;&rdquo; Catherine says.</p><p>&ldquo;For those who knew me, my journey and supported me, nothing changed. I was perceived as brave by some and others were concerned that by supporting an issue that carries so much stigma, I would open myself up to being harshly judged. In many cases this did happen, but I didn&#39;t take it personally because although it involved me, it wasn&#39;t about me.&rdquo; Donna realized.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Just knowing that you&rsquo;re not alone and that options do exist, creates an instant connection&rdquo; Catherine added. &ldquo;The more we openly talk about it, the more it normalizes a topic that should be normal in the first place.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;When we are not well, we can hurt others without realizing&rdquo; Donna explains. &ldquo;I believe as we progress through our journeys, we learn more things about ourselves. Recovery is possible! I am living proof of this.&rdquo;</p><p>When asked separately to describe their experience with Peer Options; hope, community and empowerment are the attributes both Catherine and Donna used almost unwaveringly.</p><p>&ldquo;I wanted to start living not just surviving&rdquo; Catherine expressed. After the curtains close and the charade is over, the only masks being worn are by those who don&rsquo;t understand what mental health really is. We all have it, and it&rsquo;s time we all start talking about it!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"	"public://org_profile/WHY_peers- B&W.jpg"	"Helping others on the Recovery Journey"	"Supported in Recovery by CMHA"	"<p><strong>30,599 total individuals served through all CMHA - Calgary programs/services.

Unexpectedly, I began experiencing issues with my vision and was diagnosed with a condition called Usher Syndrome which affects both hearing and vision while causing progressive degeneration of the retina. The syndrome ultimately results in extensive hearing and vision loss. For me, it meant I would become both deaf and blind.</p><p>My whole world had changed. I had to resign from my job because I could no longer read, write or drive. Many of the daily things that I used to take for granted were now seemingly impossible. Luckily, my doctor referred me to CNIB.</p><p>CNIB was there for me in this major challenge of my life. They guided me towards the resources and support I needed. I learned how to read braille, how to use a white cane properly, how to use a computer and how to slowly regain my independence.</p><p>It was a big change, but CNIB was very helpful. They came to my house and helped make it easier for me to access things like the stove and microwave. When your independence is taken away from you, it&rsquo;s a huge thing. When I was sighted, I never thought of that word, independence. Not once. Now everything I do is focused on getting it back.</p><p>Thanks to the help of CNIB, I now live an active and fulfilling life and I am grateful that they were there to support and encourage me on my journey.</p><p>- Diane, CNIB client</p>"	"public://org_profile/diane_photo (2) ReSZ WEB_0.jpg"	"Diane and her guide dog "	"Diane and her guide dog "	"<p>CNIB passionately provides community-based support to ensure Canadians who are blind or partially sighted have the confidence, skills and opportunities to fully participate in life.&nbsp;With seven offices throughout Alberta and Northwest Territories, we are a national organization with a strong local presence.</p><p>From toddlers who are born blind to seniors who develop age-related vision loss, our personalized vision rehabilitation services are offered to all age groups &ndash; at no cost to our clients.</p><p>Close your eyes and imagine that you have just lost your vision &ndash; and ask yourself: How will I cook my next meal?

How will you keep warm or travel?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>It may be hard to picture, and too far in the future to worry about, but we shouldn&rsquo;t take our energy supply for granted. Electricity can be generated from solar, wind, geothermal and nuclear energy, but currently these technologies are too expensive, and too inefficient, to replace petroleum on a global scale.</p><p>Who will find and develop the technology to exploit the non-renewable resources we are certain to need in the future? <em>Geoscientists!</em></p><p>There is a direct connection between everyday items we know and love and the natural resources they come from.

How will you charge up your solar-powered car if the sun doesn&rsquo;t shine? How is electricity generated for your electric car? With the rise of greenhouse gases and carbon taxes there is increasing pressure to cut carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants, and nuclear energy is curtailed by public fear. Geothermal energy isn&rsquo;t widely available, while solar and wind resources are sporadic and the infrastructure takes up space. Water resources are precious and will become political issues. Water must be found for growing populations in under-developed countries. Who will solve these problems that the world will face in the future? <em>Geoscientists!</em></p><p>If you live along the coastline, how will you know if there is a tsunami danger? If you are in a landslide, earthquake, or volcanic area, what&rsquo;s the risk? How will you know if your home is built in a safe and stable location? <em>Geophysicists will tell you!</em></p><p>The youth of today are the decision-makers of tomorrow and will need to make informed decisions based on science.

Shocked by the human rights violations Afghan women were facing under the Taliban regime, they began to explore how they as Canadian women could help Afghan women in a tangible and effective way.&nbsp;</p><p>Calgary became the national office of CW4WAfghan and has remained one of the most robust and active chapters in our network. There are <strong>720 Calgary and area residents </strong>who reach out in support our goals and objectives by attending our events, volunteering or keeping informed through signing up for our monthly news bulletins. Each year the local members bring together more than 600 Calgarians for its annual gala, featuring international human rights advocates like news anchor Lisa LaFlamme in 2015. Last fall the Calgary chapter hosted the CW4WAfghan National Symposium at Banff Park Lodge to connect&nbsp;volunteers from all over Canada who share a passion and commitment to improving human rights in Afghanistan. Throughout the year CW4WAfghan Calgary engages students from elementary through high school who volunteer at our events, host our speakers in their classrooms, and have started their own movements in support of human rights. A decade ago,<strong> </strong>students from George McDougall High School in Airdrie<strong> </strong>collaborated with the chapter to found Students 4 Change. This group, led by Calgary member and teacher Glyn Hughes, collaborated with us to develop our online, free Teachers&#39; Resource Kit (<a href=""http://www.cw4wafghan.ca/resources/educators-resource-kit"">www.cw4wafghan.ca/resources/educators-resource-kit</a>)&nbsp;which is now used throughout Alberta. Students 4 Change continue to hold an annual breaking bread event and have raised thousands of dollars for education programs in Afghanistan.</p><p>&quot;<em>I was inspired by Mr. Glyn Hughes, a very admirable, motivated social studies teacher at my high school to join a group called S4C.

Over 50% of the teachers trained in 2014 were female. We signed a new 3-year protocol with Afghan Government to train 3,600 teachers and launched the Lantern Program in a new province, Kapisa. Exceptional improvement was demonstrated by Lantern-trained female teachers during classroom observation visits, with unprecedented evidence of application of active learning methods</address><p><strong>Afghanistan Reads! | Afghanistan Lowalee! Community Libraries and Literacy Program:</strong> In 2014, nearly 600 literacy students graduated from the Afghanistan Reads! Program in six provinces. In partnership with the Linda Norgrove Foundation, the program put literacy within reach of adult woman and out-of-school girls through basic literacy programs; reinforces literacy by nurturing a culture of reading; encourages excellence in the teaching of literacy; and ties classes in with other skills development, including livelihoods and like skills like health, hygiene, and nutrition. Recent assessment found momentous improvement in students&rsquo; reading and writing skills; increased confidence and presentation skills; and increased participation in the life of their village after literacy classes, such as speaking up in village meetings or taking on leadership roles in their communities.</p><p><strong>Darakht-e Danesh&mdash;Knowledge Tree&mdash;OnlineLibrary for Afghan Educators:</strong> After many years in the development stages, CW4WAfghan proudly launched the The Darakht-e Danesh Library, Afghanistan&rsquo;s first comprehensive digital educational resource collection! The Library is housed within an interactive, multilingual custom-designed web platform, and is comprised of more than 1,600 resources in 14 subject categories, for both primary and secondary teachers. Users register at <a href=""http://www.darakhtdanesh.org"">www.darakhtdanesh.org</a> where they can then search the database to download or print diverse educational materials, as well as upload their own materials to share with others.

We raised $200,000 and in March 2016 we opened a new exhibit to&nbsp;tell the story of how our community became stronger and more connected.</p><p>This new exhibit tells the stories of our mountains and&nbsp;communities with a series of&nbsp;vignettes. It starts with the&nbsp;geological&nbsp;setting of the region and moves through stories about native people, the coming&nbsp;of the&nbsp;European explorers, the railway, coalmining, quarrying,&nbsp;the&nbsp;1988 winter Olympics and the development of&nbsp;the Canmore community through to&nbsp;recent times.&nbsp;</p><p>We EXIST to tell stories.&nbsp; That&#39;s what we do! Our mission is to:</p><p><strong><em>&quot;Tell the&nbsp;stories&nbsp;of our mountains and our communities to you.&quot;</em></strong></p><p>Our purpose is to be&nbsp;an authoritative resource centre in the Canmore area for the preservation and exhibition of the historical and geo-scientific heritage of the Bow Valley.

"<p>In a normal year we entertain over&nbsp;<strong>20,000&nbsp;</strong>visitors and locals<strong>&nbsp;</strong>visiting our two facilities and participating in our various programs. We run the Museum and the North West Mounted Police Barracks in Canmore and this is what you will discover when you visit the two venues:</p><p>Our main facility is our Museum, at the Canmore Civic Centre in the centre of Canmore.&nbsp;As of March 2016, our new&nbsp;permanent exhibition: &quot;<em>From Coal to Community</em>&quot; tells&nbsp;stories of both the geological and social history of the area. There are hands-on opportunities for everyone and videos provide information about the history of the Canmore area. The Museum is open seven days a week, all year long, except for a couple of days&nbsp;at Christmas.</p><p>The other facility is&nbsp;the&nbsp;North West Mounties Police (NWMP) Barracks, situated on the high Street in Canmore. This attractive, white-painted, log cabin style building was erected in 1893 to house a contingent of the NWMP&nbsp;as the area developed rapidly due to the arrival of the railway. This is a heritage building and a small exhibit in the building&nbsp;tells the story of the arrival of the &quot;mounties&quot; and the subsequent history of the people who lived in it.&nbsp; This is where we tell the rest of the stories, especially of life in the early part of Canmore&#39;s history. During winter months we rely on volunteers to run the facility which is open, on average, three days a week&nbsp;including the weekends. During the summer we employ students who keep the facility open seven days a week.</p><p>A third component of how we carry out our mandate is the development of education programs, particularly those to complement grade school curricula. We recently partnered with Lafarge to develop a program for grade 3&nbsp;classes whereby the children&nbsp;visit the Museum and Lafarge&#39;s premises at Exshaw to&nbsp;learn all about the rocks and minerals of our area and about making cement out of the raw material found in the valley.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to permanent exhibits, we plan a series of temporary exhibits within the permanent space over time. The first of these exhibits will feature Graymont&#39;s quarry operations (as opposed to Lafarge&#39;s) in the Exshaw area. This exhibit is currently being developed and is scheduled to open sometime in the Spring of 2017.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We have a board, comprised of&nbsp;twelve people, who meet regularly once a month to work on normal board activities such as fundraising, planning, governance, etc., and who also roll up their sleeves and get involved directly in&nbsp;many of the programs of the Society.</p><p>Our 2017 annual budget&nbsp;is $457,000, funds&nbsp;to be provided as follows;</p><ul><li>$145,000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Town of Canmore grant &nbsp; &nbsp;</li><li>$101,000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other grants &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>$121,000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donations &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</li><li>$51,000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Retail &nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>$39,000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admissions and programs&nbsp;</li></ul><p>This&nbsp;budget includes a provision for raising at least $100,000 for the Lamp House project.

Our sole focus is always ensuring children remain with their family where possible, reducing toxic stress and promoting healthy brain development in the early years.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2. <a href=""http://caryacalgary.ca/our-programs/teens-tweens/"">Teens and Tweens</a>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Vulnerable teenagers need our support more than ever. <strong>carya&#39;s</strong> school programs work with teens from Grade 6 to Grade 11 to support them through this important second stage in brain development. Our programs for boys and girls are designed to promote healthy relationships, self confidence, self awareness and empower youth to take control of their own life trajectory.</p><p>We work with teens outside of the school environment with workshops and one-day programs to empower and develop resiliency. We also support the entre family unit through family counselling programs.</p><p><strong>3. <a href=""http://caryacalgary.ca/our-programs/learning/"">Community Development</a>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Our community development teams work with older adults to help bridge the gap between them and their communities. We focus on empowering older adults to become leaders and contributors, passing on their life experience to the next generation.</p><p>Community development also includes our early literacy partnership in Bowmont, Bowmont Families Together, which promotes a community approach to raising children. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>4. <a href=""http://caryacalgary.ca/our-programs/older-adults/"">Older Adults</a>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Calgary is home to more than 133,000 older adults.

Being so young and having a tiny baby to care for was terrifying.</h5><p>Thankfully, I had the full support of my parents. The only thing they insisted on was that I finish my education. I started researching schools that would allow me to bring my son, because I could not afford child care. When I heard about the Louise Dean Centre, I knew it was my only option.</p><p>It wasn&#39;t until I started at Louise Dean in September 2001 that I realized how much of a blessing this school was. I was able to start working part-time after being approved for financial aid through the school. I met many strong and amazing girls who were in the same situation I was. They could all relate to what I was going through and, best of all, there was no judgment. My teachers were equally amazing; in fact all the staff were very supportive and caring. Louise Dean began to feel more like a second home than a school.</p><p>Having the Learning Centre within the school to provide affordable child care while we studied was a tremendous privilege. I will always remember Mindy, who was Dominick&#39;s caregiver. She was the most wonderful woman I had ever met. All the anxiety and worry I had about leaving my young son with a stranger was instantly cured when I met Mindy and the other Learning Centre staff. They treated every child as if they were their own.</p><p>After Louise Dean, I went to Bow Valley College for a year and then enrolled in the social work degree program at Mount Royal University. Then I met my now-husband Andrew. He was a pilot with Air Canada at the time and based in Toronto. After a few months of long hard thinking, I made the decision to be with him. I had to give up my acceptance to Mount Royal, but I enrolled in a business and health care college in Ontario and went on to graduate with a diploma in community social work.&nbsp;</p><p>I am proud to say that today I am the mother of two amazing boys! Dominick is now 16 years old and in Grade 11. He is a very talented electric guitarist and in his second year of Midget hockey. In 2013, Andrew and I welcomed another little boy.&nbsp;He is the funniest, kindest, most caring little guy you will ever meet. He is obsessed with hockey, airplanes, dinosaurs, skateboarding, soccer and BMXing. If you ask him how old he is, he will tell you he is 16, just like his big brother.</p><p>I have always imagined the day when I would be in a position to give back to the place that gave me my start in life. And for the past three years, my family has been in that position. For me it&#39;s more than just donating items to these young moms. Being involved in the Santa Sleigh Project is my way of showing them that just because they had a baby younger than most, success is not impossible &ndash; all of them can go on to fulfill their dreams.</p><p><em>Thank you to Elisa Revoy for sharing her story with us after participating in the 2016 Santa Sleigh Project at Louise Dean Centre.</em></p><p><em>The Louise Dean Centre is a partnership between Catholic Family Service, Calgary Board of Education and Alberta Health Services.

In the 1960s, CFS took a bold, unorthodox stance and prioritized services to &ldquo;unwed&rdquo; mothers. Over the years, we have continued to innovate.

We provide professional education and training services to organizations worldwide to ensure their water, sanitation and hygiene programs are effective, replicable and sustainable.&nbsp;</p><p>What does that look like on the ground? It looks like a woman in Zambia named Mary Banda.</p><p>Mary illustrates the incredible impact one person can have when they gain the knowledge and skills to provide clean drinking water and somewhere safe to go to the bathroom for their families. With that knowledge, they can then help other families in their community experience the same formative change.&nbsp;</p><p>Mary first encountered CAWST in 2006. She had lost her husband and was the single mother of six children living in a poor area on the outskirts of a town called Ndola. When she learned that her children&#39;s health problems were linked to unsafe drinking water, Mary set-out on a mission to improve the health of her family, and her community.</p><p>Mary attended a workshop provided by CAWST&#39;s partner in Zambia, Seeds of Hope International Partnerships (SHIP), where she gained the knowledge and skills she needed to understand why the water in her community was unsafe, how it was affecting her family&#39;s health and how to ensure her family could sustainably access safe drinking water and sanitation.</p><p>The impact was immediate. Having seen her family&#39;s health improve, Mary set out on a quest to expand access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation in her community. Nearly a decade later, Mary has helped build over 5,700 biosand filters and has made over 300 household visits as a community health promoter. She has been certified by CAWST as a biosand filter technician -- the first woman in Africa to achieve that designation.&nbsp;</p><p>The impact Mary achieved once she was equipped with the knowledge and skills needed to enact change in her community is but one example, among thousands, of how CAWST&#39;s focus on knowledge and skills results in meaningful, sustainable change.</p><p>----&nbsp;</p><p>Access to clean water is a human right, and yet still half the world lacks access to safe drinking water or sanitation. CAWST was born in Calgary to address this crisis in the most sustainable manner: by teaching local populations how to address their safe drinking water and basic sanitation needs and then supporting them in their actions.</p><p>CAWST is proud of its Calgary roots, having been founded by Calgarians, while one of the key solutions we teach people how to build and maintain, the biosand filter, was invented at the University of Calgary.</p><p>CAWST educates local organizations, government agencies and community-level individuals how to sustainably expand access to safe drinking water and sanitation.&nbsp; This model of education and consulting support allows us to magnify our reach by ensuring the clients we train are implementing appropriate, effective and sustainable water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) project.&nbsp; CAWST has a target of reaching 20 million people with safe drinking water or sanitation by 2020.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"	"public://org_profile/CAWST Mary (WHY) Feb 18 2015.PNG"	"Zambian Mary Banda is a certified biosand filter technician and has helped thousands of people access safe drinking water."

Much of our work is focused on eight countries: Afghanistan, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Haiti, Honduras, Lao PDR, Nepal and Zambia.</p><p>In each of those eight countries we have partnered with in-country organizations to create locally-staffed centres (called Water Expertise and Training (WET) Centres) that provide locally-adapted water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) training and education services.&nbsp;</p><p>The WET Centres are core to our strategy of addressing the global water and sanitation crisis by building local knowledge and skills. Over time, the WET Centres become increasingly independent, allowing CAWST to expand its focus to other countries knowing that the WET Centres are doing locally what CAWST does globally.</p><p>These WET Centres are key to sustainable development, as they are run by local staff who ensure that water and sanitation solutions are locally-appropriate and sustained.&nbsp;</p><p><em>&quot;This innovative process of mentoring and coaching by CAWST allows the WET Centre to deliver more than 80 per cent of its own training and consulting support services, which allows us to make a deep and sustainable impact on WASH issues&quot; - Evans Chiyenge, manager of the Zambia WET Centre.</em></p><p><em>&quot;CAWST has given us something that no one can take away from us - the knowledge, and the empowerment to do something with that knowledge. We are all working together towards the same objective of improving access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation.&quot; - Maria Inestroza, Honduras WET Centre.</em></p><p>CAWST also operates a Virtual WET Centre designed to make WASH resources and training available to anyone with an internet connection. For example, CAWST&#39;s WASH Resources website features the world&#39;s largest online collection of WASH education and training resources and has over 6,500 registered users from 164 countries.</p><p>Domestically, CAWST educates Canadian youth on local and global water issues through its Youth Wavemakers program.&nbsp; Wavemakers is a unique program that empowers youth to take action on water issues meaningful to them. The program provides educators with tools to inform and engage youth on local and global water issues, and helps to catalyze independent action through experiential learning components. There is an annual Youth Summit, which provides a platform for youth to launch Action Projects. Wavemakers provides youth with seed grants to support their projects, and mentorship is provided to aid the project in coming to fruition. These youth then get the chance to showcase their projects at CAWST&rsquo;s annual World Water Day event, which is Calgary&rsquo;s largest celebration of World Water Day. Since 2008 the Wavemakers program has reached 28,000 educators and youth, who in turn have reached over 100,000 people through increasing awareness and taking action on water issues.</p>"	"public://profiles/CAWST_teaching_model.jpg"	"CAWST provides practical training tools to empower local populations to improve WASH conditions."

"<p>By supporting CAWST&#39;s overseas service delivery, donors are achieving a &quot;ripple effect&quot; impact through CAWST&#39;s training of thousands of organizations worldwide.</p><p>When you support CAWST, you are helping to give a family the knowledge and skills they need to treat their own drinking water, build an appropriate latrine and practice healthy hygiene in the home. When a family is healthy, the parents can work, children can go to school and income can be used to support the family instead of being spent on hospital visits and medication.</p><p>The long-term effect of empowering families is incredible. Not only is that one family healthy, but they are equipped to pass those knowledge and skills on to other families in their community.</p><p>By supporting CAWST&#39;s Virtual WET Centre, you can be on the leading edge of the innovative use of technology as a tool to help expand global access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation.

An engineer by profession, he was unable to immediately land a job in his field.&nbsp; Philip wasted no time juggling his time between survival jobs. His relationship with his family started to suffer as he came home every day, feeling exhausted, downhearted, and at times, feeling humiliated at the thought that he will not be able to live his dream as a successful professional in Calgary. Acknowledging his dilemma, he welcomed the offer of support from the Centre for Newcomers.</p><p>At the Centre Philip and his wife upgraded their English language skills, worked with settlement and employment services staff to address their priorities. Inspired, and armed with his career plan, Philip pursued and finished a training course related to his profession. He continued to connect with the Centre as he applied for jobs.&nbsp; Though worried and down to their last $15, he received the good news, a job offer! Now a successful Project Co-ordinator for an Oil and Gas company, his success did not come easily. It took some time, risks and sacrifices.&nbsp;</p><p><em>&ldquo;Thanks to a devoted team of professionals at the Centre for Newcomers.&nbsp; My family cannot thank you enough for the advice and suggestions to help me set my priorities. My wife has now adjusted to the new routine, working part time and being the super mom and wife. My son is now in school.

They had been trying to have a baby for over five years, and as soon as the little one was born, he was immediately whisked away to the NICU for tests and monitoring. Nervous and anxious, they were finally allowed in to the NICU, only to see their newborn baby in an incubator, attached to scary tubes and monitors - not what new parents were expecting. They were told that he was having trouble breathing and was experiencing some seizures, but they had yet to determine the cause. Later that night, the doctor finally sat down with them and said, &ldquo;there has been some damage to his brain and there is a good chance your son will never walk or talk and will likely have to be tube fed, he has Cerebral Palsy.&quot;</p><p>In the weeks following, the parents were completely numb but had unconditional love for their son like any new parents would. Throughout the first year and the hundreds of appointments with doctors and therapists, they hoped like any parent would, that their son would just be OK and healthy. Acceptance was one of the most difficult hurdles during this time. Throughout his first five years, he attended special preschools and by the time he started what would be the equivalent of grade one, they finally came to accept the cards they have been dealt and dedicated their lives to helping him progress and be happy.</p><p>The family turned to the CPAA - not only to find answers and resources, but also in hopes of meeting other families to lean on. To their amazement, they were given an overwhelming amount of support. They have now turned their experience into a lifelong passion to help not only their son, but also other families to realize that things don&#39;t have to be as bad as they seem and that support is there, when they are ready to receive it.</p><p>As we are now into 2015, this baby boy has just turned 18 and consistently keeps his parents on their toes - even eating them out of house and home! He may be non-verbal, and not as equipped to do as many things as his peers, but he has taught his family so much. His mother left her finance job after being in the industry for 13 years and decided to follow her newfound mission to ensure that her son&rsquo;s voice was heard. That mother is me.

So we began working with him one-on-one building his interviewing skills and his confidence.</p><p>We met with Frank to review his goals and challenges. In this meeting we discovered that he was&nbsp;a very personable and determined individual who enjoyed helping people.

I&rsquo;m sixteen but my life is not like most of my friends&#39;. </strong></p><p>My parents divorced, which is pretty common, but the divorce was awful. &nbsp;I ended up living with my Mom which was not a good thing. &nbsp;She hated my Dad and to make it worse, she drank a lot. &nbsp;Living with her was hard. I ended up having to take care of her most of the time. &nbsp;Thankfully, I got to spend time with my Dad and my soon to be &lsquo;step-Mom&rsquo;, they were engaged. &nbsp;They cared about me and I actually felt safe with them. &nbsp;They wanted me to do well in school and I got to do other fun stuff too.</p><p>I felt bad for my Mom but I decided I wanted to move in with my Dad and step-Mom when I turned 16. &nbsp;Just before my birthday, my Dad was in a car accident and he died. &nbsp;I felt like my life was turned upside down. &nbsp;I was at my Mom&rsquo;s house surrounded by relatives who couldn&rsquo;t care less about me and what I was going through. &nbsp;I loved him, he was my Dad and he had just died.&nbsp; My Mom was drinking even more too. &nbsp;I couldn&rsquo;t talk to her or anyone. &nbsp;I felt so sad and hopeless; I didn&rsquo;t know what to do, but I knew I didn&rsquo;t want to be there.</p><p>I tried to figure out a plan, but I had no idea how to do it. &nbsp;I had so many questions; I felt confused and alone.&nbsp; Could I live by myself and not with my Mom? &nbsp;Would I get in trouble? &nbsp;How would I register for school?&nbsp; Could I just leave home when I turned 16? &nbsp;Could I live with my step-Mom and have her take care of me?&nbsp; Would my Mom call the police and report my step-Mom if I went to live with her? &nbsp;Would anyone I lived with be arrested? &nbsp;All I really wanted was to move in with my step-Mom. &nbsp;I had already spent so much time with her and my Dad that I felt close to her &ndash; closer to her than my Mom.</p><p>I decided to search on the net and found CLERC. &nbsp;I sent them a message explaining my situation and all my questions. &nbsp;They answered me right away and it seemed like they could help me. &nbsp;That gave me hope. The lawyer from CLERC met with me and she was able to answer all my questions and give me advice. &nbsp;It felt good to know that I could tell her anything and that she had a duty to be loyal to me and not tell anyone what I told her unless I gave her permission.&nbsp; I finally felt like there were things I could do to change my situation for the better and that CLERC would help me.&nbsp; It was cool that my step-Mom was able to be involved in the process.&nbsp; Eventually, CLERC represented me in court which was scary and not at all like on TV.&nbsp; I felt relieved when my lawyer walked me through it step-by-step.</p><p>My lawyer really cared about me &ndash; it was amazing!&nbsp; She heard and understood me and did everything she could to help.&nbsp; In the end, my step-Mom was awarded guardianship and I was able to move in with her.&nbsp; It was great to be able to be with her, someone who loved my Dad and could understand how I felt. We helped each other face the death of my Dad, grieve and move on with our lives.</p><p><strong>At 15 years old, Victoria had already endured a troubling past. </strong></p><p>When her mom passed away, she went to live with her father where she was viciously assaulted by her brother. Her father was removed as her guardian and she was sent to live with her aunt and uncle only to suffer sexual abuse by her uncle who later went to prison for his actions.</p><p>In December 2015, Victoria was finally placed with Tom and Nancy Green and their three children. Things were stable for Victoria and she became a part of the Green family. Then, without warning, Victoria experienced a serious medical issue. Tom and Nancy were not her legal guardians and found themselves helplessly unable to make decisions about her care. In order to be able to make decisions regarding Victoria&rsquo;s health and treatment, the Green&rsquo;s decided they needed to become her legal guardians. Victoria was referred to CLERC by the Office of the Child and Youth Advocate in early 2016, after a judge decided that her interests needed to be represented independently as part of the Green&rsquo;s application to obtain legal guardianship.</p><p>A CLERC lawyer met with Victoria and discussed the situation with her. She expressed that she felt loved and accepted by the Green&rsquo;s and for the first time in her life, finally felt safe and happy. CLERC conveyed Victoria&rsquo;s consent to, and desire for, the Green&rsquo;s to become her legal guardians to the Court and the Green&rsquo;s application was successful. Tom and Nancy expressed their gratitude to CLERC for &ldquo;saving Victoria&rsquo;s life&rdquo; by helping put an end to the repeated trauma she had endured in the past and giving her the chance at a normal childhood with their three other children who &ldquo;embraced Victoria as a sister and were already developing a healthy and supportive relationship with her.&rdquo;</p>"	"public://org_profile/CKC1_0.jpg"	""	""	"<p><strong>We Are:&nbsp;</strong>We are the only registered charity in Western Canada providing specialized legal support to vulnerable children and youth.

Keith&#39;s co-worker was looking for an alternative fundraising opportunity for Children&#39;s Wish. As an active guy, Keith jumped at the chance. It was there that he met Patty, a Wish mum on their team. Despite the cold conditions, Patty&#39;s story lit a fire in Keith that warmed his heart. He was inspired.</p><p>The team has grown more tightly knit since that first year. Keith is one of a core group of 10 people - like Dan Owen of OCL Studios and Jean Hunt of Ski Cellar Snowboard - who row and fundraise every year. They have even attracted former opponents to the team who were Wish parents! To this point, they are nearing the $500,000 total mark. Even in years where the Dragon Boat race was cancelled, Keith and his teammates put on functions at the Red and White Club with help from Dan of OCL Studios to make sure the team hit their fundraising marks.</p><p>Once he was in, Keith began lending his time to other Wish initiatives. He has taken part in Wish granting events, helping staff deliver the pwoer of joy to a Wish child. He has volunteered at numerous other events like the Holt Renfrew Holiday Shopping Night as well as larger first-party events like the Wishmaker Walk. As he puts it, &quot;Anything Children&#39;s Wish needs, I&#39;m there. I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m on speed dial now.&quot; He has even been honored at our Gala for his outstanding philanthropy.</p><p>Keith is one of dozens of dedicated volunteers who lend their time to yearly initiatives to grant Wishes.

"387"	"Chinook Country Historical Society"	"3"	"<p>Imagine a city without public libraries, without parks or a performing arts centre.&nbsp; Who were the driving forces behind making Calgary one of the best places to live?&nbsp; What was their passion?&nbsp; How did this passion and determination change how we live today?</p><p>Many of the stories of the prominent people who were instrumental in building our city and province are well documented, but what about the lesser known people in our history like William Reader or Annie Davidson? How did they contribute to our culture?</p><p>Imagine a library without any books? Within the first few days of opening Calgary&rsquo;s first public library in 1912, every single book had been borrowed. Clearly, Calgary was thirsty for knowledge but Annie Davidson already knew that. A 70 year old widow and mother of 10 she understood the value of books and the need for a library in what was a burgeoning city.</p><p>Annie Davidson moved to Calgary in 1906 to be closer to her children. She brought with her a passion for reading. It didn&rsquo;t take her long to find others who loved to read as well and she soon established the Calgary Women&rsquo;s Literary Club where like-minded ladies would get together to talk about the books they read. However Annie Davidson and the other ladies of the club recognized that most of the books in Calgary were in the private collections of the few people who could afford them. Even the schools have very few of them in their collection. They were determined to make books available to everyone.&nbsp;</p><p>But getting the first library built wasn&rsquo;t easy. In order to get the library approved, they needed to get 10 percent of the people who were eligible to vote to sign a petition asking city council to build a library.&nbsp; Keep in mind that at this time, women were not allowed to vote, so the ladies had to get the men of the community to agree to build the library. Their first attempt was a unsuccessful as they didn&rsquo;t get enough signatures.&nbsp; Undeterred, they went around knocking on doors a second time and succeeded in getting enough signatures.</p><p>By 1908, just 2 years after Ms. Davidson arrived, City Council approved the building of the library and on January 2, 1912, it opened its doors to the public.&nbsp; Within a few days, almost 10 percent of the people in Calgary had registered for library cards.&nbsp; Shortly after the library opened, the shelves were totally empty &ndash; all 5,200 books that were there on opening day had been borrowed.</p><p>Unfortunately, Annie Davidson never saw her dream come true.&nbsp; She died at the age of 78 in 1910, before the library opened.&nbsp; Her spirit lives on in the Memorial Park Library, the library that was built as a result of her passion and determination.</p><p>We strive to make our history relevant to today and the future. We research and tell the inspiring stories of Albertans, including the achievements of Lougheed, Cross, Burns and Edwards, but also the stories of important but less well known individuals such as Davidson and Reader. In literature and presentation, we show how a small number of individuals with a determined spirit and a strong faith in their mission can affect the course of history.</p><p>The Chinook Country Historical Society is a chapter of the Historical Society of Alberta which was established in 1907 as one of the first acts of the legislature of the newly created province. Embodying the passion of our first Premier, Alexander Cameron Rutherford the act states, &ldquo;The object of the Society shall be to encourage the study of the history of Alberta and Canada, to rescue from oblivion the memories of the original inhabitants, the early missionaries, fur traders, explorers, and settlers of the north and west of Canada, to obtain and preserve narratives in print, manuscript or otherwise of their travels, adventures, labour and observations, to secure and preserve objects generally illustrative of the civil, religious, literary and natural history of the country.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"	"public://org_profile/SunsetChinookArch.jpg"	"Chinook Arch Sunset Calgary"	"Chinook Arch Sunset Calgary"	"<p>Each year we showcase history of the Calgary region in monthly presentations from September through May and for 11 days during Historic Calgary Week in late July/early August.&nbsp; We present some 75 programs that explore the diverse culture and history of the region.</p><p>Although CCHS organizes and supports Historic Calgary Week, we work with many other local organizations that have an interest in history.&nbsp; Many of these organizations showcase their specific interest in history as part of our overall program.

"378"	"CIVIX Canada"	"3"	"<p>In his early 20s, Taylor Gunn set out to develop a program that would teach kids about voting, foster their connection to the community, and eventually reverse the decline of voter turnout.</p><p>With a very limited amount of resources and support from education stakeholders, Taylor recruited a small team to build a student engagement model that would secure the participation of hundreds of thousands of students in the first-ever province-wide parallel election program in Canada. On October 2nd 2003, more than 335,000 students took part in the inaugural Student Vote program during the Ontario provincial election.</p><p>Since then, Student Vote has been brought to the federal level, and to other provincial and municipal jurisdictions across the country. By building extensive partnerships with election offices, school boards, media outlets, community and financial support, Taylor and the CIVIX team are ensuring that our democracy is brought to life in the classrooms and homes of young students across Canada.</p><p>-----&nbsp;</p><p>The participation of citizens in the electoral process is a central component of a healthy democracy, yet a marked decline in voter turnout has plagued Canada over the last two decades. Electoral participation reached an all-time low of 59 per cent in the 2008 federal election, and voter turnout in most provinces is hovering at 50 per cent.</p><p>More concerning is the fact that low voter turnout is disproportionately concentrated among young Canadians. In the 2011 federal election, only 39 per cent of voters were aged 18 to 24, compared to 70 percent of voters aged 55 and older.</p><p>Research suggests that the habits of voting and non-voting persist over time.&nbsp; If Canadian youth don&rsquo;t vote now, they likely won&rsquo;t become voters later in life. This has serious implications for the future of our democracy.</p><p>CIVIX exists to give young Canadians a solid base of interest, knowledge and experience to inspire their citizenship. Without it, they will continue to stay away from political participation, public policy and voting.</p><p>With it, they will guarantee a healthy and robust democracy for Canada.</p>"	"public://org_profile/3546022837_dd62c62f61_z.jpg"	"Elementary student casting a ballot."

Our long-term goal is to reach every school in the province.</p><p>In the most recent provincial election, more than 92,000 Student Vote ballots were cast from 838 schools, representing the province&rsquo;s best-ever participation in the program.

His mom worked multiple jobs to make ends meet and Akeem only half-jokingly says he raised himself.</p><p>As a teenager at school in Calgary, Akeem met Steve Mesler, Olympic gold medalist in bobsled, <a href=""http://classroomchampions.org"">Classroom Champions</a> co-founder, and the organization&rsquo;s first athlete mentor. Steve talked to Akeem&rsquo;s class about their futures and how to be accountable for their goals. This is something a growing roster of Olympians and Paralympians now do throughout the school year as part of Classroom Champions structured, technology-based programming delivered in partnership with in-class teachers in underserved communities in Calgary, and across Canada and the U.S.</p><p>At times, Akeem struggled in school and in his chosen sport of track and field. However, he had a positive and optimistic outlook, an ability to set goals and persevere in achieving them, and he could dream big dreams. With the help of mentors like his coaches, as well as Steve, Akeem built on his strengths. He completed his education and he also won a bronze medal in track and field for Canada at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Looking back on the tough times he endured, Akeem says he wishes he had Classroom Champions when he was growing up. For him, Classroom Champions teaches kids that &ldquo;nothing is unattainable,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;success is a state of mind.&rdquo; Now one of dozens of Classroom Champions athlete mentors himself, Akeem delivers monthly lessons to students on goal setting, perseverance, fair play, and giving back to community. Having been in a similar situation to so many of his students, he can relate to them and work closely with their teachers to help them build the confidence and the camaraderie he knows they need to succeed both in and out of the classroom.</p><p>Akeem believes his purpose has always been to be of service to others. Through Classroom Champions, he gets to give back to underserved children across Canada. He also receives a lot in return, both through the training in public speaking and digital communications that he receives through Classroom Champions and through the support of his students. &ldquo;When I went to visit my classrooms, I was having a tough time with the training and mentally sticking with it,&rdquo; he says about his preparation for the Olympics in Rio. &ldquo;Then I go and it&rsquo;s like a refresher. They helped re-energize me!&rdquo;</p><p>Akeem understands that &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do it alone. You can&rsquo;t choose success alone,&rdquo; and says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a village of individuals help get me to where I am today.&rdquo; &nbsp;For this athlete mentor, success comes from understanding the impact of your choices on other people as well as yourself, and from &ldquo;making a choice that&rsquo;s going to be beneficial for you and your family.&rdquo; Classroom Champions also believes that building a community of support for the kids who need it most is the right choice to make because through those strong connections everyone succeeds.</p>"	"public://org_profile/Classroom champions day Drayton Valley-1 processed.png"	"Akeem Haynes visits Alberta classroom"	"Athlete mentor Akeem Haynes visits Alberta classroom"	"<p><strong><em>Giving kids a champion to help them</em></strong></p><p>Many deserving young students in underserved communities face significant barriers to obtaining the critical skills they need for personal, academic and career success.

This is the focus of everything we do. Our vision is that CTH contributes to a future where every child will belong to a family and feel valued and secure. Through the use of evidence-based practices and innovative solutions, CTH will strive to preserve, reunify and build stronger families who can care for their children and contribute meaningfully in their community.</p><p>We provide a broad array of strength-based and family-centered services that teach, coach, and support families to create new possibilities and achieve better futures together.</p><p>Our services ensure that children have stable, healthy and safe living environments in which to grow and develop.

The Youth Centre at CommunityWise serves immigrant, refugee and Indigenous youth ages 12 &ndash; 24 and saw the need to do something about racism many of the youth face. Beltline Youth Centre wanted to put on a community celebration of diversity and inclusion, showcasing the talent of the youth who use the centre and inviting wider community to join in.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>A great idea! But how is it possible to organize an event on top of all the everyday demands of running a youth centre??

We were delighted and spread the word to other member groups immediately. The Aboriginal Friendship Centre, another member group with offices at CommunityWise has been collaborating regularly with us and was interested in supporting the Anti-Racism Day event.&nbsp;</p><p>Suddenly in only three weeks time, we were organizing a big community event together! What better way to acknowledge and address racial discrimination than to work with diverse communities and all ages towards a shared goal?&nbsp; What better way to come together than in a fun, celebratory and educational event?</p><p>The event attracted around 100 children, youth and adults, which happens to be the maximum capacity of the main common room! People were spilling out of the building into the yard. Attendees enjoyed a free meal sponsored by our local City Council Ward, funding secured by CommunityWise staff. CommunityWise board members came out to the event, as did representatives from other organizations in the building. Children and youth from Calgary After School programs and from the Youth Centre had opportunities to perform and share their experiences through hip hop and spoken word.&nbsp; The audience made up of a diverse range of CommunityWise members, educated each other on the issue of racism from the perspective of youth and through stories shared by Aboriginal Friendship Centre representatives.</p><p>Recognizing the need, collaborating with members and providing the space, CommunityWise had a vital role in this unique and transformative event.

"321"	" Deaf & Hear Alberta (formerly Deaf & Hard of Hearing Services)"	"6"	"<p>Barriers to communication have a direct and measureable impact on learning, employment prospects, relationships, social inclusion, safety and mental health.</p><p>90 percent of all Deaf children are born to two hearing parents. Deaf children are not having their communication needs met in early childhood or in the classroom. That&rsquo;s why Deaf &amp; Hear Alberta is implementing a new program that gives Deaf children a boost in the early stages of their life to acquire language skills in their first language of American Sign Language.&nbsp;</p><p>A Deaf student finishing high school typically graduates from Grade 12 with a Grade 3-4 reading level. Deaf &amp; Hear Alberta puts trained tutors in the classroom to work one-on-one with struggling Grade 1 and 2 students to improve their English comprehension, literacy skills and therefore their future prospects.</p><p>Deaf &amp; Hear Alberta&rsquo;s&nbsp;<strong>Interpreting Services</strong>&nbsp;provides almost 7000 hours of interpreting annually to facilitate communication between Deaf users of American Sign Language and hearing audiences. Our roster of over 70 highly skilled ASL-English interpreters provide communication access to Alberta&rsquo;s Deaf community.</p><p>Our&nbsp;<strong>Accessibility Services</strong>&nbsp;department ensures that Deaf individuals remain safe in their homes and are able to lead productive lives with signaling equipment, warning detectors, and personal alerting systems.</p><p>Almost one in four Canadians has a hearing loss. That translates to almost 250,000 Calgarians. Research by audiologists indicates that it takes someone who is losing their hearing 5 to 7 years to admit they have a hearing loss and then do something about it. Once fitted with hearing aids, 15 &ndash; 18 percent of people never wear them, receiving no benefit from their sizable investment.</p><p>To address these issues, Deaf &amp; Hear Alberta has launched a new education series called&nbsp;<strong><em>Sound Advice</em></strong>. This series alleviates the fear of hearing loss, demystifies all the options for hearing aids, helps participants develop realistic expectations about their hearing health, provides new skills in reading visual cues like lip-reading, and offers an in-depth program in brain retraining.</p><p>Children and youth are the fastest growing demographic at risk for hearing loss, with an estimated one in five already having some hearing damage, in large part resulting from excessive volume from personal music players, concerts, etc. Thanks to The Calgary Foundation, we are able to work with junior high school students to develop a compelling message that will convince children and youth to&nbsp;<strong><em>Practice Safe Sound</em></strong>!</p><p>When someone cannot hear well enough to communicate, the individual is at risk of withdrawing from the world around them. People with hearing loss at any age may be affected, but elderly seniors are most at risk of social isolation. When the lack of hearing inhibits brain functioning, a higher risk of the onset of dementia is the result. Severe hearing loss is also linked to depression, anxiety and paranoia. Deaf &amp; Hear Alberta is developing a core of trained volunteers with our&nbsp;<strong><em>Peer-to-Hear</em></strong>&nbsp;program to provide companionship, counselling, mentoring and support to those hard of hearing persons at risk of social isolation, therefore reducing the risks for mental health issues.</p><p>Through the assistive technology available from our Accessibility Services Department, hard of hearing persons are able to remain safe in their homes, communicate with their loved ones, retain their social connections and fully participate in their community.</p>"	"public://org_profile/DH Web Capture M+C Expanded.png"	"Woman and boy practice ASL"	"Woman and boy practice ASL"	"<p>Our client groups are distinct and different. The Deaf community is a unique cultural group united by shared history, stories and visual language &ndash; American Sign Language. Those who are born deaf or lose their hearing in early childhood (before they learn spoken language) make up about 0.1 percent of the population.&nbsp; The culturally Deaf base their identity on their use of American Sign Language. Those who are late-deafened, or lose their hearing later in life, brings this sector to about one percent of the population.</p><p>People may lose their hearing at any time in their lives, but aging and noise-induced hearing loss are the two main causes. Severity of hearing loss may range from mild to profound.&nbsp; The hard of hearing&rsquo;s primary mode of communication is verbal.</p><p>Recognizing these fundamental differences in modes of communication is what forms the foundation of our work. Programs and services within Deaf Services are targeted to the Deaf community or those who want to learn how to communicate with the Deaf community; and programs and services within Hearing Services are targeted to those with a hearing loss or at risk of losing their hearing.</p><p>OUR&nbsp;MISSION&nbsp;| We enhance the lives of Deaf, deafened, and hard of hearing persons by removing barriers and building bridges to communication.</p><p>OUR VISION | We are working toward a world free of communication barriers for the Deaf, deafened, and hard of hearing.</p><p>OUR IMPACT | Hearing loss affects 23% of adult Canadians; we serve 38,000 deaf and deafened Albertans.&nbsp;</p><p>OUR RESULTS | 2016:</p><ul><li>Continued renovations with new &quot;fish bowl&quot; office, accessible washroom doors and an extraordinary kitchen makeover;</li><li>Launched &quot;Peer-To-Hear&quot; Pilot program with 9 mentee/mentor matches who met once a week for three months;</li><li>Launched &quot;Sound Advice Program&quot; to provide more opportunities for people with hearing loss to learn and share information (e.g., Book Club, Colouring Night, Speaker Series...);</li><li>Launched three-month Emergency Pilot to enable faster response times towards unmet emergency requests;&nbsp;</li><li>Developed &quot;Extraordinary Technology&quot; to provide more service in small town Alberta via Skype, Facetime and Telehealth&quot; where deaf Albertans contacted us for help with their medical, legal and other types of appointments.</li></ul>"	"public://org_profile/DH Box_Educate Balance_0.jpg"	"Education for families in Deaf community"	"Education for families in Deaf community"	"<p>Established in 1961, the Deaf and Hear Alberta has been breaking down barriers to communication for over 50 years.

We invite you to truly experience performance, to be affected each time you come to the theatre.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong>DSW &ndash; never leave unchanged</strong></div><p><strong>I have attended lots of performances presented by DSW</strong> over the past 5 years and in that time I have witnessed many positive developments in both the dancers and the presentations. At DSW performances I am drawn irresistibly into the world of the dance through the enhanced strengths and focused intent of the dancers. I really enjoy watching the development of the young choreographers as they show their works at the beginning and then at the end of mentored workshops.&nbsp; Consistent hard work in the creative process has obviously translated into aesthetically rewarding performances for the dancers and for me as an audience member. As a life-long eclectic arts-lover I have seen that every art form needs individuals or organizations with the vision to expand the frontiers of that form. DSW must be commended and celebrated for doing that in Calgary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>Audience Member: Sondra Corff, PHD.,&nbsp; life-long eclectic arts-lover</em></p><p><strong>DSW is the only organization in Calgary that offers consistent professional development programs for dance professionals in contemporary dance</strong>, so I value it greatly. It is a forum where community building takes place, every experience offered by DSW helps me to connect with other artists in the community (from dance or other genres), as well as with artists outside the community. It helps me to feel a part of something greater than myself. It has always served as an important conduit for the vital transition of being a student/ emerging artist and entering phases of development that lead to becoming an established and more accomplished artist in the professional community locally and nationally. Without DSW I would not have been able to accomplish as much as I have in my professional career.</p><p><em>Participant Artist: Helen Husak, Lieutenant Governor&rsquo;s Award Winner</em></p><p>I consider my varied experiences at DSW to be invaluable, <strong>there is no comparable programming available to me as a dance artist in Calgary.</strong> In 2014 I became a member of the Dance Action Group, I was mentored in a choreographic process by Davida Monk, I&rsquo;ve taken morning classes through DSW, attended performances, discussed work at talk backs and at the undressing the dance series, and worked as an outside eye for the Alberta Dance Festival. These experiences have developed my technique, my choreographic eye and improved my ability to communicate verbally about the art I&rsquo;m creating and viewing. Most importantly DSW has given me the chance to share my experience with other artists, be influenced by their unique perspectives and connect with artists I haven&rsquo;t worked with in the past.&nbsp; &nbsp;The most significant positive aspect of my experience with DSW is constant learning and growth. Each experience at DSW is a tool that fuels me as an artist and challenges my perspective allowing me continue to develop.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Participant Artist: Catherine Hayward</em></p><p>What about Dancers&rsquo; Studio West?</p><p>I have been a practitioner, advocate and champion of Calgary&rsquo;s arts since early 1980. During that time I have seen the remarkable growth and vitality of Calgary&rsquo;s artists contribute to the quality, character and economy of our City. It makes me proud. But while other genres of arts practice have shown resilience, dance continues to lag behind its colleagues in Calgary and the Province. Dancers and dance companies seem isolated. Taken individually, the diverse work of our dance artists excels artistically, but contemporary dance has yet to take its place in the arts lexicon in the same way as theatre, music, film, and visual art. This situation became clearly evident to me while I was Managing Director at Calgary Arts Development. It was during that time that I became more acutely aware of the work being done at Dancers&rsquo; Studio West under the artistic leadership of Davida Monk. I had a few occasions to have in-depth conversations with Davida about the state of contemporary dance. <strong>I was impressed by the clarity of vision on behalf of both DSW and the contemporary dance community as a whole.</strong> With the courage and energy of the organization and with Davida&rsquo;s leadership, Dancers&rsquo; Studio West is building a vision that contains the promise of propelling contemporary dance to its deserving place in the cultural life of our community. It is for this reason that I am proudly serving on the Board of Directors for Dancers&rsquo; Studio West.</p><p><em>Board of Director: Tom McCarthy</em></p>"	"public://org_profile/DSW_06_02-326 copy.jpg"	"Dancers' Studio West - never leave unchanged"	"Dancers' Studio West - never leave unchanged"	"<p>In the 2014-15 season, DSW launched the<strong> Dance Action Group (DAG)</strong>.&nbsp; DAG is a small ensemble of aesthetically diverse performer/choreographers under the direction of Artistic Director Davida Monk, committed to, and experienced in, DSW&rsquo;s approach to artistic rigour and critical dialogue.&nbsp; In addition to forming the artistic core of the Dance Action Lab, the members of the Dance Action Group co-operate to fulfill opportunities for community development and organizational support. &nbsp;Throughout the season, the members of DAG will be active in organizing and leading of Critical Dialogue Series, in co-curating and co-hosting of community work in local studios, and in offering outside eye services.</p><p><strong>Dancers&#39; Studio West Society Season:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Undressing the Dance Dialogues</strong>&nbsp;- Between September and March, DAG members animate a series of six public discussions of specific works seen in Calgary, or selected topics of dance aesthetics and creative practice.</li></ul><ul><li><a href=""http://www.dswlive.ca/season/aadf/""><strong>Annual Alberta Dance Festival</strong></a>&nbsp;(<strong>September</strong>): DSW&rsquo;s annual favourite, the two-weekend festival features fresh contemporary dance created by Alberta choreographers.The artistic purpose of the Annual Alberta Dance Festival is to provide a range of aesthetically diverse choreographers, including emerging artists, with creation and performance opportunities; to integrate the outside eye services of DAG in the development of the work; to engage the public in discussions around the work, and to build artistic relationships among artists of all levels of experience.

"6"	"<p><strong>We often realize that we are in the right place at absolutely the right time. &nbsp;Last week was one of those times. </strong></p><p>We were working with a small rural school and met a young boy named Paul. Initially Paul sat off to the side of the school-wide assembly, seemingly bored and un-engaged. We assumed he was off in his own world, perhaps daydreaming about lunchtime or what he was going to do after school. But during the first break, Paul quietly approached us, with tears in his eyes, and simply said &quot;I have been bullied for 3 years and no-one in this school cares.&quot; He proceeded to tell us about the numerous times he went home hungry because people stole his lunch, and that he had never wanted a birthday party because he knew that no one would come. He had several other stories to share but then he dropped the real bombshell. A week earlier he had gone out to the family shed and held his dad&#39;s shotgun in his mouth, ready to pull the trigger. &nbsp;He was worn down and tired of the living nightmare his life had become. He simply wanted to give up. Thankfully, he didn&#39;t pull the trigger that day. We did not ask him why...we simply hugged him and told him how happy we were that he was here with us. We promised him that if he stayed the day, he would realize that there is hope and that he is not alone in this world. Paul was in Grade 6. &nbsp;Just a young boy growing up in a not-so-perfect world. Imagine if he had gone through with his intentions. Imagine the impact it would have had on his family and his community.</p><p>What happened later that afternoon is exactly why we continue to do what we do at Dare to Care. Paul, who had felt like giving up only days before, was now surrounded by 15 -20 of his classmates. They were hugging and crying and individually apologizing for what they had done to him. I think you&#39;d agree that Paul&#39;s life changed that day. &nbsp;</p><h5><strong>The sad reality is that there are 150,000 &#39;Pauls&#39; in this country. What if one of these children was your own child, and you had no idea? Would you want someone to be there for them?</strong></h5>"	"public://org_profile/CALGARY FOUNDATION2_0.png"	""	"Be a hero...help a child."	"<h5><strong>NO CHILD should ever feel alone, afraid, or unwelcome in their school or community.</strong></h5><p>Bullying is not just a school issue. &nbsp;Bullying is a societal issue that is impacting individuals in all areas of school, community, sports, work and home life and we all play a role in making sure our world is more accepting and kind. Dare to Care was the first fully comprehensive program launched in Canada in 1998 to tackle the pervasive and crippling issue of bullying and mental health amongst our children and youth. &nbsp;Our belief is that all children and youth have a right to feel safe, welcome, and included in their school and community. &nbsp;Dare to Care consists of three programs:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><em>Innovative and age appropriate workshops for students, athletes, and sports teams.</em></li><li><em>Support and education for parents &nbsp;to recognize the signs of bullying and mental illness</em></li><li><em>Extensive Professional Development for teachers, administration,coaches, and officials&nbsp;</em></li></ol><p><strong>Because of bullying:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>150,000</strong> Canadian students miss school each day&nbsp;</li><li><strong>7 out of 10</strong> children quit organized sport by age 13</li><li><strong>53% of teachers</strong> who quit state it&#39;s because they feel ill-equipped to deal with bullying and other challenging &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;behaviors in their classroom.</li></ul><p><strong>Our 2015-16 Results:</strong></p><ul><li>Impacted over 75,000 students, parents and teachers last year</li><li>Expanding into Calgary amateur sports in the September 2017</li><li>Received the 2016 Government of Alberta Inspiration Award for Leadership in Bully Prevention in schools and communities</li></ul>"	"public://org_profile/CALGARY FOUNDATION_1.jpg"	""	""	"<p>The Dare to Care program is designed to assist schools and community groups in establishing inclusive and safe environments where everyone has a sense of social responsibility. &nbsp;Since 1998, Dare to Care has delivered three flagship programs:</p><p><strong><a href=""http://www.daretocare.ca/programs"">1) Age-appropriate workshops for </a>&nbsp;students/athletes/sports teams&nbsp;</strong>: Through developmentally appropirate assemblies and skill development, children and youth are given the knowledgfe and skill set to collectivley make a difference in their lives and the lives of others. &nbsp;The Dare to Care Student Day emphasizes the important concepts of awareness, empathy, resilience and social responsibility.</p><p><a href=""http://www.daretocare.ca/programs""><strong>2) Parent Information Sessions:</strong></a> &nbsp;Including the parents within the school &nbsp;and sporting community is integral in the success of the Dare to Care program. &nbsp; Parents attend a 2.5 hour information session that will provide them with the awareness and skills to be able to help their children negotiate the sometimes difficult and confusing social world. As well, the session will focus on the self-monitoring of the parent&#39;s own behavior when in school or at a sporting event.</p><p><a href=""http://www.daretocare.ca/programs""><strong>3) Professional Development for Teachers/ Administrators/Coaches/Officials: </strong></a>&nbsp;Teachers, administrators , and coaches play a critical role in creating a climate of support and empathy inside and outside of their classroom or sporting team, yet over the past 17 years we have heard the same feedback repeatedly from educators and coaches....they feel very ill-equipped to effectively deal with &nbsp;bullying. Professional development provides the tools and support needed to implement policies and strategies to prevent and intervene in bullying.&nbsp;</p><p>Many bully prevention programs have come and gone without having any significant impact on the culture of the school or community. &nbsp;The reason is simple, if we don&#39;t mobilize the silent majority or bystanders, nothing will ever change. &nbsp;The silent majority/bystanders are the untapped resource in every school and community. &nbsp;These are the students, players, parents, teachers, etc., who witness the bullying but feel too afraid or ill-equipped to intervene. &nbsp;</p><p>Through age-appropriate workshops for children and youth; through education and support for parents; and through extensive professional development for teachers, coaches, youth leaders, etc., the Dare to Care program is helping to shift the imbalance of power away from the few who bully and into the hands of the caring majority. &nbsp;</p><p><em>For a detailed look at the various Dare to Care programs click see our<a href=""http://ckc.calgaryfoundation.org/sites/ckc.thecalgaryfoundation.org/files/documents/org_docs/DARE%20TO%20CARE%20INFORMATION%20PACKAGE-SCHOOLs_0.pdf""> Information Package for schools</a>.</em></p>"	"public://profiles/DARE TO CARE_SAD BOY.jpg"	""	""	"<p><strong>Schools and Sporting organizations cannot effectively deal with the pervasive issue of bullying without significant support from outside resources.</strong></p><p>Dare to Care&#39;s ability to work with schools and sporting organizations is impaired only by budgetary constraints. &nbsp;We have always prided ourselves in providing program subsidies to all schools and sporting organizations so that no one is denied the support they need due to lack of &nbsp;funds. &nbsp;The only way we can continue to do this is through the generous donations made from private and public sources:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Donate directly on our&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.daretocare.ca/"">website</a></strong></li><li><strong>Donate through&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.canadahelps.org/en/charities/dare-to-care-bully-prevention-life-skills-inc/"">Canada Helps</a>&nbsp;for monthly giving or a one time donation</strong></li></ul><p><em>Here is how your donation helps prevent bullying across Canada:</em></p><ul><li><strong>$500 = 1 school or sporting group receives subsidy</strong></li><li><strong>$10,000 = 20 schools or sporting groups receive subsidy</strong></li></ul><h5><b>Join the conversation to create #BullyFreeSchools and #BullyFreeSports across Canada by following us on <a href=""https://twitter.com/DareToCare2?lang=en"">Twitter</a>, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/daretocare/"">Facebook</a>&nbsp;and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/daretocare2/"">Instagram</a>.</b></h5>"	"public://org_profile/CALGARY FOUNDATION3_0.png"	""	""	"lisa@daretocare.ca"	"https://www.facebook.com/daretocare/"	"@daretocare2"	"http://www.daretocaresocialchange.com/"	\N	"834066177RR0001"	"403.620.5156"	"lisa@daretocare.ca"	"Lisa Dixon-Wells"	\N	"150000"

"541"	"Discovery House Family Violence Prevention Society"	"6"	"<p>Susan came to Discovery House, like many mothers we support, with a heartbreaking and complicated story. After surviving an abusive relationship for years, she reached out for help to overcome her addictions and be reunited with her two young children. The addiction was a direct consequence of the abuse, and she had asked her mother to look after her children during the recovery period.&nbsp;</p><p>But leaving an abusive relationship is a process, not an event, and Susan wanted support to start a different kind of life for her and her family. With the Discovery House team and Child and Family Services, she created a service plan that included safe housing at Discovery House and counseling supports so she could be with her family again.</p><p>It was not an easy transition for this young family and Susan struggled with being a full-time parent. For years, her abuser had called her &ldquo;ugly,&rdquo; &ldquo;worthless,&rdquo; and a &ldquo;waste of space.&rdquo;&nbsp; She had no self-esteem, felt incapable of succeeding in anything and thought she was a bad parent. The abusive relationship took a toll on her children, who were often emotional and confused.</p><p>Now that the family was together, each individual was paired with a Case Manager and able to receive one-on-one support. Susan and her children all started to feel safer and free to plan for a stable future. Susan registered both kids in kindergarten. She set personal goals and even got accepted into a local college program.</p><p>Of course, there were setbacks along the way, but Susan had new tools at her disposal to work through them. The Discovery House team works hard to empower women to take back control of their lives and build a new future free from abuse. With the support of the case managers, this young mother started to believe in herself again and the children got their Mom back, a little bit healthier and happier.</p>"	"public://org_profile/Photo 1.png"	"Discovery House supports families to live free from abuse. "	"A mother and her child share a bonding moment. "	"<p>Leaving an abusive partner is the most dangerous time for women and children who have lived through ongoing abuse. Given the high risk, it is essential that these families have a safe place to stay, heal, and start to plan for a new future.</p><p>Founded in 1980, Discovery House was the first long-term women&rsquo;s shelter in Calgary. Over the years, we have grown to support 120 families at any given time, all on their journey to living free from domestic abuse. &nbsp;We strive to make our communities free of family violence by providing integrated residential and community services for abused women and children to enable them to live safely in the community.</p><p>Women with children leaving physical, emotional, financial, sexual or spiritual abuse all receive one-on-one support from trained Case Managers. Together, they determine what their unique goals and priorities are, be that improving parenting skills, finding housing, budgeting and financial assistance, gaining employment, going back to school or legal support.</p><p>Calgary has one of the highest rates of domestic abuse in Canada. The Calgary Police Service received nearly 16,500 domestic dispute calls in 2013 and nearly 3,000 of those calls resulted in pressing charges against the abusers. This, coupled with low vacancies and high rents means that there is a very real need in Calgary for long-term supports.</p>"	"public://org_profile/Photo 4.png"	"A woman playing with two children."	"We support 120 families in Calgary at any given time. "	"<p>Discovery House Family Violence Prevention Society is comprised of two main programs; the Shelter Program and the Community Housing Program. Teams work with families to obtain housing, fulfill basic needs, and navigate the financial and legal support systems with an emphasis on safety, healthy relationships, and housing stability.</p><p>The Discovery House building is home to the <a href=""http://discoveryhouse.ca/our-work/residential/"">Shelter Program</a>. It has 19 apartments and 24-hour security personnel who oversee a state-of-the-art surveillance system. Families are welcome to stay for up to one year, during which time clients and staff work together to connect to services in the community or take advantage of in-house workshops and assistance. Outreach programs continue with each family for one year after leaving the shelter. The team includes Adult Case Managers, Child and Youth Case Managers, Child and Youth Development Workers, a Family Support Worker and a network of peers.</p><p>Domestic violence has no boundaries, and the <a href=""http://discoveryhouse.ca/our-work/community-housing-program/"">Community Housing Program</a> strives to serve all women and children in need. Keeping that in mind, the Community Housing Program uses the Housing First model to support 100 families affected by abuse in long-term, stable market rental housing. The model has a strong history of success in housing the homeless population, but Discovery House was the first in Canada to apply it to situations of domestic abuse. In the Community Housing Program, families receive support from their Case Manager, a Mental Health Specialist, a Child and Youth Support Specialist and a Housing Liaison. Families are welcome in the program for up to two years. All of our services are individualized and voluntary, so families can access as much or as little support as they desire to accomplish their goals.</p>"	"public://profiles/Photo 2.png"	"A mother and her daughter."

In 1977, The Drug Information Centre changed its name to Distress Centre/Drug Centre and was accepted as a member of the United Way. In 1980, Distress Centre launched Canada&rsquo;s first peer-to-peer youth crisis program &ndash; the teen line, which was later renamed ConnecTeen.</p><p>In 1999, Distress Centre continued to experience tremendous growth as we introduced several new programs and partnerships including the Mobile Response Team. In 2005, Distress Centre, along with the City of Calgary and United Way, launched 211. This further established Distress Centre as the hub of crisis support and the &ldquo;go-to&rdquo; place for community referrals in Calgary. In 2010, Distress Centre celebrated its 40th Anniversary with one memorable crisis line number, 403.266.HELP (4357), and continued to provide free professional counselling to individuals, couples and families in crisis. In 2012, Distress Centre launched their online services from 5-10PM daily.</p><p>In 2013, following the June floods, Distress Centre responded to an over 40% increase in help-seeking calls to 211. In July, the 211 service is expanded to High River to help those impacted by the floods. In November 2013, ConnecTeen launched their texting service.</p><p>In 2016, 211 played a critical role in supporting the Fort McMurray/Wood Buffalo evacuees when wildfires ravaged the area in May. 211 provided evacuees with up-to-date information and connected donors/volunteers with agencies they could support.

Its respected team of biologists finds answers to important environmental questions and establishes the value of wetlands to society.</p><p>DUC delivers the Project Webfoot education program to thousands of students and teachers annually and partners with interpretive centres where the public explores and learns about wetlands firsthand.</p><p>DUC works with all levels of governments, advocating for programs and policies that benefit wetlands and stop critical wetland loss.</p>"	"public://org_profile/pintailweb.jpg"	"Ducks Unlimited Canada "	"Pintail hen and her brood"	"<p>As a science-based conservation organization, we have our own dedicated team of&nbsp;experienced scientists from&nbsp;The&nbsp;Institute for Wetland and Waterfowl Research (IWWR).&nbsp;They find answers to important environmental questions and establish the value of wetlands to waterfowl and society. Our science&nbsp;helps guide our various conservation programs.</p><p>Habitat Retention&nbsp;programs secure habitat for the long term. This include the acquisition of land, conservation easements and agreements, and the implementation of best management practices (BMPs) to retain productive capacity of the landscape.&quot;footer&quot;</p><p>Wetland Restoration&nbsp;programs involve the restoration or enhancement of degraded or drained wetlands through the restoration of hydrological or ecological function. We restore wetlands by simply plugging drainage ditches, or through more elaborate measures involving dykes, dams and engineered water control structures.</p><p>Government and Industry Relations&nbsp;programs support all conservation programs. This includes working with various levels of government (federal, provincial, municipal, etc) and industry to change behavior or land use to meet conservation objectives. Examples include advancing effective provincial wetland policies or helping designate protected areas in the boreal forest.</p><p>Landowner Relations&nbsp;programs provide support to the thousands of dedicated landowners across Canada that we partner with in delivering on-the-ground conservation efforts. Together with landowners, we develop practices that benefit both them and the environment.</p><p>Upland Restoration&nbsp;programs restore upland areas around wetlands to a condition that better supports nesting waterfowl. This is done through the conversion of annual cropland to grassland (including hayland, pastures and areas managed specifically for nesting waterfowl), and by encouraging farmers to adopt winter wheat into their annual cropping practices.</p><p>Habitat Asset Management&nbsp;programs maintain the condition of habitats (both upland and wetland) that we retain and restore.</p>"	"public://profiles/duckhandsweb.jpg"	"Ducks Unlimited Canada"	"Research is a key component to our conservation strategy."

Over the past 63 years we have grown, adapted and worked hard to make a difference for all Albertans and their families by providing direct services, financial assistance, a summer camp and an equipment program. &nbsp;We also provide public education, research and advocacy in the province of Alberta.</p><p>For Daniel, being at Easter Seals Camp Horizon has changed him and the way he sees life. &nbsp;He is more confident and realizes that he still has a lot of ability even if he has a disability. &nbsp;For Dermott, receiving his new wheelchair through Easter Seals Alberta after his old one left him helpless allowed him to leave the house with confidence again. As a senior, being part of the community he helped build is important.</p><p>The history of what is now the Easter Seals Alberta Society begins in 1951 and has reflected the needs of the times. As new disability related organizations formed and others folded, and government policy and activities changed, our organization maintained a focus on the needs of Albertans with physical disabilities.&nbsp; In 1951, motivated by the polio epidemic sweeping the continent, Albertans gathered to raise funds for services and equipment needed by children disabled by the disease. &nbsp;That year, the first Easter Seal and Easter lily appeared in this province. &nbsp;In 1959, our services expanded to assist physically disabled adults and seniors to ensure that everyone, regardless of age had someone in their corner.</p>"	"public://org_profile/Becky and Paige.png"	"Easter Seals Alberta- Making a Difference"	"Alberta Easter Seals Society- Making a Difference"	"<p>No one expects to be diagnosed with an illness or injury that affects mobility, independence and dignity. But one in seven Albertans face those challenges daily. Thankfully, these individuals and their families can rely on the Easter Seals Alberta Society to provide mobility equipment, summer camps and other services to provide the best quality of life as possible. &nbsp;</p><p>Throughout Alberta we provide low-income individuals with physical disabilities of any age with the mobility equipment they need to remain independent and to participate in their communities. The equipment we provide through our <strong>Equipment and Support Services (ESS) </strong>program is life changing. It allows for greater freedom, independence and encourages Albertans with disabilities to live to their full potential. Feeling inspired and empowered, our clients can then better focus on their goals in life which can include accessing their community to volunteer, gainning employment, shopping for groceries and attending medical appointments without having to depend on others.</p><p>As a last resort program it acts as a safety net to ensure low-income does not remain a barrier for these men, women and children by ensuring that they do not &ldquo;fall through the cracks&rdquo;.</p><p><em>&ldquo;Easter Seals is a blessing for seniors with limited mobility and on a fixed income. Without organizations like this, life would be almost unbearable for those seniors. They would be confined to their homes or apartments and have little or no independence.&nbsp; Without the help of Easter Seals, it would be impossible for seniors on a fixed income and with mobility concerns to have a reasonable quality of life.&rdquo;</em> &ndash; Dermott, ESS Client</p><p>On average there are 17 clients a month in Calgary and area on our wait list waiting for over $60,000 worth of equipment.&nbsp; Provincially, our monthly average is 67 clients a month waiting for over $250,000 worth of equipment. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In most cases, we retain ownership of equipment that is purchased and provided.&nbsp; When that equipment is no longer needed, it is returned to be refurbished and recycled out the next client on our list when possible.&nbsp; This has become a very cost effective way of running our program as last year we provided 207 Albertans with mobility equipment at a total cost of $440,357.&nbsp; Out of those 207 clients, 85 received recycled equipment which saved our organization a total of $245,442.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Average Cost of a Helping Hand</strong></p><ul><li>&nbsp;Power wheelchair ..................................$3,500 - $12,000</li><li>&nbsp;Portable house ramp .............................$600 - $1,100</li><li>&nbsp;Porch lift ..................................................$4,500 - $7,000</li><li>&nbsp;Power scooters .......................................$2,900 - $5,500</li><li>&nbsp;Electric lift assist chairs .........................$1,000 - $2,300 &nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Another big part of what we do is creating memories, promoting healthy self- esteems, and making dreams come true for the many children with disabilities that attend our summer camps each year at <strong>Easter Seals Camp Horizon</strong> located in Bragg Creek.</p><p><em>&ldquo;The kids at school focus on my disabilities, while the people at camp focus on my abilities.

Specifically, funds raised through EMS Foundation support education, injury prevention, research and equipment.</p><p>Considering supporting EMS Foundation today! There are many ways to make a tax receipted general donation to EMS Foundation:</p><ul><li><strong>Monthly Giving -&nbsp;</strong>As little as $10 per month can help support EMS Foundation!&nbsp;Choosing the Monthly Giving Program not only helps you to budget by spreading out your charitable donation but also helps us in forecasting our cash flow so we can determine in advance the work we can support.

"238"	"Ethno-Cultural Council of Calgary (ECCC)"	"7"	"<p>My name is Dewan and I was quite an accomplished man before I moved to Canada in 2014. I take pride in my previous career as a United Nations employee and enjoyed frequent international travels. After my retirement, all I aspired for was to reunite with my children in Calgary. Moving to Canada was a life-changing moment for me. Having been a resident of a capital city with over 8.5 million people and warm sunny climate, coming to Calgary was a big change. I never realized how difficult it is for older adults like me to live and settle in Canada</p><p>I was very lonely at first, especially because I had to be on my own most of the time when my children had to work. I missed my relatives, friends, my own home, and my country of birth. So I decided to go out and look for new friends. I met Bangladeshi older adults who, like me, were experiencing similar difficulties connecting with people of their own age group. One day, I met a Bangla teacher who connected me to Ethno-Cultural Council of Calgary (ECCC), an organization that provides leadership training to immigrants and refugees. What caught my interest was their training program that provides practical tools, skills, information and contacts that I can use to help me help others. I loved the fact that the training ends with an action plan that I can shape and implement to achieve my goal of helping immigrant and newcomer older adults help themselves through connections.</p><p>In between three training sessions that I attended, I went around contacting as many older adults that I could, learned about services available, improved my communication skills, and gained more confidence in talking to people whom I have never met.&nbsp; I felt good about connecting my contacts to programs and services. I finally started to realize that as I was helping other people, I was also helping myself feel adjusted to life in Canada.</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t want to stop. I attended more training sessions at ECCC and served as a community connector for older adults. Through the bi-weekly training sessions, I learned about services for older adults as well as provincial and federal benefits and services that I never imagined exist. With more knowledge, I was able to help more people. I also encouraged those from the Bangladeshi community to participate in events, overcome loneliness, and find friendship and support.&nbsp;</p><p>With support and encouragement from ECCC staff, I worked diligently with the Bangladeshi Community Centre to develop a Seniors&rsquo; Club which now meets twice a week. The club has been gradually attracting a larger group of older adults at every meeting. The club is not only helping older adults, but also adults who are transitioning to retirement.&nbsp; The club helps people prepare ahead of time for their retirement, which I know will give them a sense of security and a happier life.</p><p>I am working hard with the Bangladeshi community to promote the club as a safe and welcoming group that provides genuine support to those who have to offer as well as to those in need.</p><p>Participating in ECCC&rsquo;s leadership training program helped me fulfill my desire to support and improve the life of others. I have come to realize that a newcomer retiree like me who started with barely no contacts outside of my family, can make a huge difference in the community. I am so proud to say that I did not only get help for myself, but others too.&nbsp;</p>"	"public://org_profile/Resident led engagement.jpg"	"Group of resident-led engaged participants"	"We collaborate and engage with resident-led communities"	"<p>The Ethno-Cultural Council of Calgary came into existence in 2002 amidst the rise in racial tension following the events of September 11, 2001. From its inception, ECCC has been in the forefront of many initiatives addressing issues of diversity, human rights, racial inequities and public participation. It has built the leadership, presence and participation of diverse communities in civic activities, public consultations and policy making. The Council has also developed innovative approaches that strengthen the role of ethno-cultural communities in the design and delivery of social services, in domestic violence prevention and in neighbourhood strengthening. It has started important research on the impact of policy changes to Calgary&rsquo;s immigrant population.</p><p><strong>Vision -&nbsp;</strong>Calgary is a just and equitable society for all.</p><p><strong>Mission -&nbsp;</strong>We facilitate the collective voice of Calgary&rsquo;s ethno-cultural communities towards full civic participation and integration through collaborative action.</p><p><strong>Approximately 1700 individuals participate annually in ECCC&rsquo;s various programs and initiatives. Many participants go on to lead projects that benefit their own communities as well as the broader public. </strong></p><p>For example, a group composed of Vietnamese-Canadian mothers who were moved by the impact of the Calgary floods on children and families put together a fundraising concert with volunteer artists that raised $6,000 for flood relief. In another example, members of several Somali groups&nbsp; and partners came together to create a community assessment report of the Somali-Canadian Community in Calgary (Pathway to Belonging 2013) that is now spawning actions to address issues of isolation in the community.</p><p><strong>Our key strategies are:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Leadership development and civic engagement as a cornerstone and constant element of all our work</strong></li><li><strong>A Community Broker Model that builds on the strengths of communities and help them engage larger systems </strong></li><li><strong>Community-based solutions to important issues, like prevention of domestic violence </strong></li><li><strong>Collaboration and social innovation that brings different sectors and groups together to develop new approaches</strong></li><li><strong><strong>Combining research and community action to effect systems and policy change</strong> </strong></li></ul><p><strong><strong>ANNUAL REPORT Highlights 2014-2015:</strong></strong></p><p>The past year saw many ethno-cultural organizations grow their ability to play important roles in influencing change. These evidences of the growing capacity of ethno-cultural organizations to effect social change inspire ECCC and its 49 member organizations. They also are impetus for ECCC to continuously adapt to trends affecting our political, economic and social landscape to better support our member organizations and their communities.</p><p>We&#39;ve been spurred to exert leadership and to further strengthen collaboration with our member organizations and communities to collectively respond to these developments. We have developed our Theory of Change around four strategic approaches:</p><ol><li>community-led solutions;</li><li>community broker strategy;</li><li>civic engagement and mobilization; and,</li><li>public policy and systems&nbsp;change.</li></ol><p>All our programs will integrate and connect under these pillars.</p><p><strong>Program Results:</strong></p><ul><li>323&nbsp;Leaders, Brokers, and Community Organizers trained</li><li>464&nbsp;Volunteers were recruited who contributed&nbsp;5,651&nbsp;Volunteer hours</li><li>3&nbsp;Publications and toolkits launched</li><li>Collaborated with&nbsp;<strong>193&nbsp;</strong>Organizations, community groups and agencies&nbsp;as partners and networks</li></ul><p><strong>Executive Director&#39;s Report</strong></p><p>There is growing recognition of ECCC&#39;s unique role and contribution in providing ethno-cultural perspective to national&nbsp;initiatives and organizations.

Healthy Relationships </strong></p><p>Our primary prevention approach to domestic violence and building healthy relationships works on three levels:</p><ol><li>Engaging men in domestic violence prevention and developing role models in healthy relationships</li><li>Working with young men and boys to create a new generation of men</li><li>Strengthening Community intervention to encourage healthy families and relationships</li></ol><p>We create safe environments for men and boys to talk about how they are impacted by immigration, violence and abuse, and how they can overcome these cycles.

Research and Policy</strong></p><p>We publish policy papers and tool kits that assist ethno-cultural community members to become informed and engaged in systems and policy change initiatives. Our research and policy briefs also inform policy makers of the needs of ethno-cultural communities.</p><p>Our research and policy work focuses on participatory research that engages community members and public education and community led action on systems and policy change. For example we:</p><ol><li>Conduct research on the effects of changes to the family reunification program on Calgarians.</li><li>Produce a user friendly guide on changing immigration policies and provide public education presentations on the topic.</li><li>Engage with ethno-cultural communities around civic participation.</li><li>Produce educational policy briefs on issues of concern to ethno-cultural community members.</li></ol>"	"public://profiles/leadership engagement.jpg"	"Attendees at a Leadership engagement session"	"We develop, train and engage leaders through Community Organizers"	"<p>An inclusive city needs the efforts and contributions of all members.

Now that she was raising her own family, she was determined to make a better life for her kids. She found a partner who she thought would help lift her up, but instead, when things got tough, he yelled at their kids and sometimes hit them. The cycle of abuse was repeating.</p><p>Three of Darleen&#39;s four children were born premature and suffered from developmental delays. Her daughter Sara experienced &quot;severe, severe delays -- she didn&#39;t walk, she didn&#39;t talk.&quot; She didn&#39;t interact much with the rest of the family. Doctors suspected that she suffered from some form of autism.</p><p>One of Darleen&#39;s older children had been referred to the EvenStart program by Child and Family Services, so she had Sara assessed at the earliest opportunity. &nbsp;She was accepted, and soon started attending the five-day-a-week, half-day program. She was picked up and delivered home each day on an EvenStart school bus.</p><p>Darleen said it was difficult at the start because Sara wasn&#39;t accustomed to other people, and added &quot;she was about the mentality of a one-year-old, so what little speech they could get out of her you couldn&#39;t understand. She mostly communicated in grunts and pointing.&quot;</p><p>But she rapidly saw improvement. &quot;Sara did speech therapy, she did occupational therapy, she did play therapy, pretty much everything (EvenStart) had to offer she took part in,&quot; she said. The results were remarkable. &quot;She started to talk, she started to actually interact to some degree with you.&quot;</p><p>Sara had been very distant with her siblings. But, after working with the early childhood therapists and teachers at EvenStart, &quot;she started interacting with the other kids at home, she kind of did a 180,&quot; said Darleen.</p><p>People started to exist around her,&quot; she added. &quot;Even something as simple as her bringing a toy to you, to engage you, was something she hadn&#39;t done before.&quot;</p><p>Sara stayed in the program until Grade One, at which time she was ready to enter a &quot;regular&quot; school, according to Darleen. &quot;She has trouble with transitions, so transitioning to regular school I thought would be a lot harder than it was.&quot;</p><p>&quot;They do still figure she is delayed, but I think the difference early intervention has made is huge in her life,&quot; she said. Sara is now in Grade Six, and Darlene reports that &quot;the teacher said that academically, she&#39;s bang on now. She&#39;s caught right up. They still see some emotional regulation issues but they said she&#39;s really come a long way.&quot;</p><p>According to Darleen, Sara &quot;loved everything about (EvenStart), the arts and crafts, and she still talks about the teachers she had. She&#39;s got photo albums ... with pictures of her teachers throughout the years.&quot;</p><p>Darleen is grateful for all the help she and her family received, including the therapeutic work with Sara and home visits from EvenStart staff. &quot;It&#39;s huge, they&#39;ve helped me in so many ways in terms of emotional support and parenting advice. &nbsp;It&#39;s made a huge difference in my kids&#39; lives.

The children get a chance to dress in costume, learn new languages and handle artifacts as they learn what make different cultures unique.</p><p>Tours of the Fort Calgary Interpretive Centre and 1888 Barracks are also essential in telling our story.&nbsp; A visit to Fort Calgary begins with a brief history of the founding of Fort Calgary and the founding of the North West Mounted Police in Canada. Individuals/Groups are greeted by our interpretive staff who will bring to life the defining moments in the opening of the Canadian West through authentic experiences and our original location. A video presentation is included to enrich the guest experience. The remaining portion of the tour is self-directed and visitors can explore our many temporary and permanent exhibits. Visitors are encouraged to have their picture taken in an authentic Mounted Police uniform. It is also highly recommended that visitors leave time to explore the site and stroll along the scenic Bow and Elbow Rivers.</p><p>Special Events are integral in reaching larger audiences and connecting with our community. Winter Carnival, Mountie Day, Canada Day, Heritage Day, Alberta Culture Days and Doors Open YYC are all free, family oriented events. These events give Fort Calgary a chance to reach a broader demographic of people who may not have the financial means to visit Fort Calgary.</p><p>We also encourage people to make their own history with our Food and Beverage Department.

His dad is a doctor, his mother a nurse, his brother and sister are honours students and so was he. You wouldn&rsquo;t expect him to be an addict, driving the getaway car for his pals who were robbing pharmacies to get Oxycodone, but there he was. He didn&rsquo;t get there overnight; and he didn&rsquo;t come back overnight either &ndash; both roads were long and filled with heartache. The road down was a terrifying, lonely freefall and the road back was like an ascent of Everest accompanied by many Sherpas taking many forms.&nbsp;</p><p>When John&rsquo;s family moved to the US years ago his parents were concerned about the quality of schooling and decided to home school their three children. When they moved back to Canada, John was just going into grade 10 and while homeschooling did wonders for his academic record, his social skills &hellip; well, they were more than lacking. He felt that he didn&rsquo;t really fit in anywhere and kept to himself mostly. Eventually some guys invited John to hang with them and he began to feel that he was part of something and not alone. They would smoke and drink, then blaze (smoke pot) and graduated to harder drugs eventually taking the highly addictive Oxycodone and it&rsquo;s there that his life really began to take a tailspin.</p><p>While John started to use Oxy occasionally, he soon came to depend on it and developed an addiction to the drug. As John&rsquo;s Oxy use increased his school attendance decreased along with his grades that quickly dropped from A&rsquo;s to D&rsquo;s and F&rsquo;s until he dropped out of grade 11 midway through his fall semester. With dwindling resources to support their habit, John and his friends thought it would be a good idea to go directly where their drug of choice was and started robbing pharmacies. What seems to be a good idea to an addict typically is not and their brilliance soon ended with all of them being arrested and charged.</p><p>A judge looked at John&rsquo;s limited criminal history and believed that John was a good person and, had it not been for the addiction that he developed, he would not have done the things that earned him his record.</p><p>Embarrassed, dejected and determined to prove to his family that he was the good person that they believed he was, John found Fresh Start Recovery Centre and began his journey on the road to long-term recovery. John enrolled in Fresh Start&rsquo;s 12-week, 12-Step program, excelled, moved into our second stage program.&nbsp;</p><p>John&rsquo;s family was also determined to understand the disease of addiction and what they could do to help their son&rsquo;s recovery without enabling him. Both parents enrolled in Fresh Start&rsquo;s family Healing Program and made a six hour round trip every week for five weeks to attend the two hour classes. Just before one full year into his recovery John thought he&rsquo;d visit his old friends and share with them how well he was doing and perhaps inspire them. Not having a full appreciation of his vulnerability and not realizing that recovery doesn&rsquo;t have the same meaning for everyone the visit ended with him giving into peer pressure and blazing with his old pals.</p><p>John immediately realized his mistake, left his friends and told his family what had happened.</p><p>Embarrassed and dejected John came to back to Fresh Start to pack his things and go to another recovery centre feeling that he had let us down. One of the Fresh Start&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sherpas&rdquo; drove John to the other centre and during the 40 minute drive convinced him to give himself another chance with the realization that addicts are never cured of their disease but - as with other chronic illnesses like diabetes &ndash; are able to manage it and enjoy a normal, healthy life.</p><p>John ended up coming back to Fresh Start, going on to complete his program for a second time, living in Fresh Start&rsquo;s supported second and third stage housing while earning his high school equivalency and then pursuing his dream of a career in Medicine.</p><p>A few short weeks ago a doctor stood in front of 120 people at one of Fresh Start&rsquo;s Birthday Celebrations and presented his son with his 2 year medallion and through wavering voice and teary eyes thanked Fresh Start for being by John&rsquo;s side during his long climb of recovery. He was grateful that John had achieved two years of continuous sobriety and honours standing in his pre-med program.</p><p>Who knows, someday in the future the doctor that treats you and perhaps saves your life could be the addict - in recovery - that you helped to save.</p>"	"public://org_profile/FS WebBnr Snip Feb25.JPG"	"Fresh Start building and logo"	"Living in Fresh Start’s housing allows the pursuit of dreams."

"489"	"Friends of Fish Creek Provincial Park Society "	"8"	"<p>I remember swimming at Sikome Aquatic Facility when I was 10 years old, watching the trucks drive over the bridge across the Bow River along Highway 22X, and thinking that Fish Creek Provincial Park really was on the edge of the city. That was long before neighborhoods like McKenzie Towne, Cranston, Auburn Bay, Chapparal and Silverado were developed - and Shawnessy and Evergreen were under construction. Growing up in Deer Ridge, I was always thankful to live so close to this park and enjoyed many visits to Sikome, Mallard Point and the vast grassland area along the Bow River. I always had the impression that the park was a wild place, far away from the stresses of school, parents and city life, a place where I could be alone and relax, or spend time with friends without grownups around. In the past 20 years the city of Calgary has grown and literally engulfed the park. Each year more people enjoy the park, but the potential impact on this area also increases. Fish Creek is a truly unique and amazing area that all Calgarians are fortunate to have as an extension of our own backyard. The Friends of Fish Creek exists so that people can enjoy the park and all it has to offer, and work to raise awareness about preserving this valuable natural resource so future generations will enjoy it as much we do today.&nbsp;</p>"	"public://org_profile/Creek.jpg"	"Fish Creek"	"Fish Creek"	"<p>Fish Creek Provincial Park is one of the largest urban parks in Canada and is an extensive protected natural area with much to offer. The park is a place to appreciate and experience nature close to home, be active, spend time with family, and relax and unwind in this beautiful, unique setting.</p><p>Fish Creek Provincial Park receives over 3 million visitors a year. It is a major recreational facility for the surrounding communities and has been a mainstay of family recreation for close to 40 years. The park&rsquo;s ecosystems need to be protected. Financial and voluntary contributions to the Friends of Fish Creek are reinvested into the park and the majority of volunteer programs the Friends offer have measurable and visible impacts.</p><p>HISTORY - The Friends of Fish Creek was incorporated as a Registered Charity in 1994 and for the past 20 years we have been dedicated to preserving this park for the benefit of the people who depend on it. We collaborate with park management, volunteers, community organizations and Society members, the majority of whom live within the nearby communities.</p><p>The Friends of Fish Creek office is located at the Cookhouse in the historical Bow Valley Ranch area of Fish Creek Provincial Park. We started as volunteer-run non-profit organization and now have 4 staff members, additional support staff, over 700 Society members, approx. 400 volunteers, many of whom are high-skilled volunteers with a wealth of knowledge to share, over 100 community partners throughout the city and province, including local businesses, community associations, non-profit groups and local media outlets.</p><p>The Friends create informed park users by engaging community members through public awareness and encouraging the responsible use and enjoyment of Fish Creek Provincial Park. Through environmental education and the fostering of ecological literacy, the Friends inspire stewards to respect the park as an amazing natural resource for the community to enjoy.&nbsp;</p><p>MISSON - To engage the community through education and awareness to conserve a truly unique naturalized urban park.</p><p>VISION -&nbsp;A sustainable Fish Creek Provincial Park that improves the quality of life for present and future generations.</p>"	"public://org_profile/ScoutsNaturalistBadgeProgram_0.JPG"	"Scouts Naturalist Badge Program at Fish Creek Provincial Park"	"Scouts Naturalist Badge Program at Fish Creek Provincial Park"	"<p>The Friends collaborate with volunteers to deliver programs, courses, events and activities throughout the year to help create informed users and preserve the ecological integrity of the park. New Wellness programs such as Yoga, Guided Meditation and Running Clinics provide innovative ways for people to relax, rejuvenate and reconnect with nature in Fish Creek.</p><p><strong><a href=""http://friendsoffishcreek.org/programs/minibus/"">PARK TOURS</a></strong> - In the Summer of 2014 we expanded on the Minibus program to include tours of the park that focus on the unique geology of this area, the wetlands, natural features, unique history, nature photography as well as private tours. Minibus tours provide people with accessibility issues and mobility problems a means to experience Fish Creek Provincial Park. Participation at community outreach events in the nearby communities enable the Friends to connect with and engage people about who we are, what we do and how they can help preserve the park.</p><p><strong><a href=""http://friendsoffishcreek.org/programs/speaker-series/"">EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS </a></strong>- Long standing educational programs like Speaker Series and the Birding Courses are primarily volunteer-run and attract hundreds of people a year to the park. These programs help inform community members about the wonders of the natural world both in and around Fish Creek Provincial Park,&nbsp; strengthen our message of environmental conservation and appreciation, and help increase the Society&rsquo;s reach and the number of members we have.</p><p><strong><a href=""http://friendsoffishcreek.org/park-protector-signup/"">YOU CAN SUPPORT OUR PARK</a> </strong>- The majority of our educational programs receive little or no funding but are made possible by our skilled staff and dedicated volunteers. You can support the Friends by volunteering, making a donation, joining our new Park Protector monthly donor program, or by joining us as a member.</p><p><a href=""http://friendsoffishcreek.org/td-learning-naturally-program/""><strong>TD LEARNING NATURALLY NEEDS YOU!</strong></a></p><p>In the 2012&ndash; 13 school year 3,678 students between grades K&mdash;6 were provided with an unforgettable learning experience in Fish Creek Provincial Park. Through the TD Learning Naturally program, children from 31 economically disadvantaged schools learned firsthand about the wonders of the natural world through&nbsp;programs like Insect Intrigue, Wildlife Cycles, Plant Communities, Wetlands, Tree Tales, the Fish Creek Family, Fish Creek Land Histories and Stories, and more.</p><p>This essential program has never been funded by the Provincial Government and its continuation is in jeopardy. The Friends of Fish Creek need your support in helping this program continue. Each programming day costs approx. $500 and&nbsp;enables 50 kids to learn about nature in Fish Creek Provincial Park. You can now support this program with a onetime donation of $20, $50, $100, $125, $250, $500 or another amount. Please consider this opportunity to&nbsp;enrich the life of a young person who otherwise would not have been afforded this opportunity. 100% of your generous donation will go directly to funding Learning Naturally and encouraging environmental stewardship in the next generation. You will receive a valuable tax receipt for your donation.</p><p>Volunteers help the Friends every single day in an endless number of ways.

"482"	"La Fondation franco-albertaine"	"8"	"<p>I was born in a French-Canadian family on a farm near the small town of Plamondon (pop. 250) situated approximately 200 kilometres north of Edmonton. As a family, we spoke French at home however we only had one hour of French per day at school.</p><p>This amounted to many children growing up with a poor knowledge of their first language and sometimes ending up not comfortable to speak it anymore.</p><p>As an adult and father, I met a francophone leader from Edmonton who made me realize what a treasure my parents had bestowed on me with my French language and culture and how it was slipping away. French is my&nbsp; heritage, it&#39;s another window on the world, another way to understand any situations, its music and songs, plays and dances - it&#39;s another sense of humor, another way to live, another way to love, it&#39;s friends everywhere in my country and around the world who share my language.</p><p>Other francophones from Plamondon and I founded the French-Canadian association of Plamondon/Lac La Biche followed by helping to establish a francophone school and cultural centre.</p><p>Now that I&#39;m retired, I would like to leave a legacy, to help my community grow and develop beyond my ability to be there to do so. Younger people are now at the head of the French association, more than a hundred children are in the French school in my village and I want to make sure they have financial support to help them discover the beauty of their French legacy.</p><p>That is where La Fondation franco-albertaine plays an important role in my personal story as it has enabled me to set up an endowment fund to help them year after year to leave wonderful experiences and develop new projects.</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reed Gauthier, Donor</p><p>The Francophone heritage in Alberta dates back to the earliest days of the fur trade when the Montreal peddlers came to the Northwest region in search of adventure and business opportunities. The voyageurs married Cree women and the first Francophone communities, Métis communities, were established. Members of religious orders came and were followed by settlers. In this process, which spanned over 200 years, significant contributions were made to the settlement of the West and the founding of Alberta. Early pioneers knew the importance of establishing institutions such as schools, churches, and community organizations.<br /><br />The French-speaking community has since grown and contributed to the social, cultural and economic development of the province. As the community expands, the need for resources and services in French increase, thus putting more financial strain on non-profit organizations and the public sector. Through the promotion of philanthropy, <em>La Fondation franco-albertaine</em>, with more than $330,000 given back to the community, works towards the development and vitality of the many francophone cultures that are an essential part of our Canadian identity.</p><p>---------------------------</p><p>Je suis né dans une famille canadienne-française sur une ferme près du village de Plamondon (population 250 personnes) situé à 200 kilomètres au nord d&#39;Edmonton.

Je me suis ensuite impliqué sur de nombreux comités francophones provinciaux.</p><p>Maintenant je suis à la retraite et je désire laisser un héritage qui aidera ma communauté à continuer à grandir et à se développer au-delà de ma vie.</p><p>C&#39;est là que La Fondation franco-albertaine joue un rôle important dans mon histoire en me permettant de créer un fonds de dotations qui continuera, longtemps après mon départ, à appuyer les causes qui me sont si chères au coeur.</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reed Gauthier, Donateur</p><p>Le patrimoine francophone en Alberta remonte aux premiers jours de la traite des fourrures lorsque les marchands montréalais sont venus dans la région du nord-ouest à la recherche de l&#39;aventure et des occasions d&#39;affaires. Ces voyageurs ont épousé des femmes cries et les premières communautés francophones de la province, des communautés métisses, ont été établies. Ensuite, les membres d&#39;ordres religieux ont été suivis par des colons. Au cours de ce processus qui a duré plus de 200 ans, des contributions importantes ont été apportées pour la colonisation de l&#39;Ouest et la fondation de l&#39;Alberta.La francophonie albertaine est d&#39;importance historique, politique, économique, culturelle et sociale.

Here is one example:</p><p>&ldquo;I was concerned about my daughter when I realized that, at 9 years old, she was having serious trouble reading. It was when I was visiting a family resource centre that I noticed FESA&rsquo;s Literacy and Parenting Skills (LAPS) program. I decided to attend in hopes of helping my daughter. I began learning more about how to help with her literacy challenges, and after several weeks I was feeling more confident with my own literacy and parenting skills. While taking this program I discovered that I enjoyed, and had a talent for helping other parents.</p><p>By the next year my daughter&rsquo;s reading skills were greatly improved and I had become a leader in the group. Because of my progress and my ability to help others, I was asked to become an assistant to the facilitator. FESA provided me the training I needed, and soon I was able to lead and facilitate my own programs.</p><p>Fast-forward to today: My daughter is about to successfully complete high school, and now has also begun working as an assistant.

They are also rich in history - Aboriginal communities built their teepees here, buffalo roamed and the once vibrant Glenbow Township thrived here for short time. &nbsp;Sitting between Calgary and &nbsp;Cochrane, these lands could easily be developed into stunning, sought after residential areas. But land owner Tim Harvie and his three sisters Carol (Raymond), Katie and Pauli (Smith) did want to see their lands developed. &nbsp;They wished to honor their father and mother&#39;s wishes and preserve these lands for all to enjoy. So they sold these lands at a low cost to the Government of Alberta and with the funds - created the Glenbow Ranch Park Foundation. The Foundation was created to build the infrastructure and programming needed to make this park what it is today. They hoped that the Foundation would always exist to encourage stewardship of the land, support research initiatives, promote park use by all and ultimately grow and development the park with support from other local land owners and the Government. With Tim Harvie still an active board member, their vision remains, and will always remain, at the heart of what we do here at the Foundation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"	"public://org_profile/school at park small.jpg"	"A class of school children dressed in brightly colored shirts overlooking the Bow River valley from Glenbow Ranch Provincial Park."

Located along the north shore of the Bow River between Calgary and Cochrane, the park boundaries encompass more than 1,300 hectares of foothills parkland and native grasslands. These surroundings provide fantastic opportunities for the foundation to teach visitors about significant natural features, endangered ecosystems and rare species, archaeological finds such as teepee rings, the historic Glenbow town-site and quarry, and the ranching and industrial history of the region.</p><p><strong>OUR MISSION</strong>: The Glenbow Ranch Park Foundation supports park development and the visitor experience at Glenbow Ranch Provincial Park.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>OUR VISION</strong>: Glenbow Ranch Provincial Park is a pre-eminent destination that inspires all visitors to become stewards of the land .</p><p><strong>OUR HISTORY</strong>: The foundation was established in 2007. The GRPF is part of the Harvie family&rsquo;s contribution to the build-out of the provincial park, making it accessible to all Albertans. We are a registered charitable organization working to make Glenbow Ranch Provincial Park a great destination for visitors and to residents of Alberta.</p><p><strong>ACCOMPLISHMENTS</strong>:</p><p>- Since 2011 we&rsquo;ve built nearly 30km of trails and visitor facilities throughout the park including our most recently completed section of the Calgary to Cochrane Trail.&nbsp;</p><p>- Since 2016 our in school educational programming (Discover Archaeology and Discover Grasslands) has taught over 2,500 children from Cochrane and Calgary about the rich history of the lands that surround them and the need to protect them.&nbsp;</p><p>- Since &nbsp;our golf cart tours have offered hundrends of families, seniors and those with mobility issues a chance to see the park in its entirety all while learning about the cultural and historical uniqueness of the park.

For 2 years they lived in poor conditions in a safe house in Lebanon. Arriving in the spring of 2013,&nbsp; the family lost their home in the Calgary floods. It was a difficult adjustment, coping with so much loss and trauma.&nbsp;</p><p>When Baseer and his brother were chosen to be part of the Green Fools Social Circus Program in July 2013, they were apprehensive, as they did not speak English. The Green Fools Social Circus Program welcomed Baseer and his brother and provided an inclusive, supportive, inspiring, and breakthrough week. Baser and his brother were championed as they braved new experiences, trying out stilt walking, juggling, unicycle and trapeze. The program and the instructors made it possible for the participants to excel at their new skills. This gained confidence and inspired Baseer and his brother to make new friends and overcome fears, all while building a sense of joy and self worth. When Baseer&rsquo;s father saw the final performance at the end of the week, he said: &ldquo;My children learned so much from the camp:&nbsp; motivation, self esteem, courage and self confidence. They were so happy at the camp you cannot imagine!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Opportunity&rsquo;s that provide inclusion and support are proven to help youth in need become productive and positive members of a community. This work can subvert the possibility of depression, suicide, gang association, or violence. Giving kids a chance makes all the difference in the world.</p><p>As we take our award winning theatre works and Cirque du Soleil endorsed Social Circus Programs to young people all over the world, we see that the spark of creativity is in everyone. We have worked with youth from Africa to Nunavut desperate to find their place.&nbsp; At Green Fools, we aspire to make social circus a life changing experience, engaging audiences from all walks of life, diverse cultural and socio-economic backgrounds. We create theatre and circus that isn&#39;t always bound to a theatre. We bring it to the street, to communities, to schools. Our stilt walkers perform in hand crafted masks and costumes, inspiring so many different people at festivals and events around the world. Our theatre shows have garnered awards and have toured internationally, shining a light on social issues and the enduring spirit of the human heart with our original stories and puppets. Our training opportunities have also earned acclaim and tour worldwide, offering programs in circus skills, puppetry and mask for all levels.&nbsp;</p><p>The Green Fools believe that a positive arts experience can have a profound effect on an individual or community. It is often difficult to measure but when one experiences communities coming together for a common goal &ndash; it can be a catalyst for enormous change. The essence of our theatre shows and our social circus programs are an alternative intervention into the lives of young people who need to be inspired, encouraged and given the opportunity to succeed. Our past experiences implementing social circus projects in remote communities have demonstrated to us that a simple belief in young people gives youth the motivation to believe in themselves. And with the valued support from the greater community we can ensure our most vulnerable youth can and will continue to thrive well into the future.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"	"public://org_profile/Directions2.jpg"	"Green Fools "	"Green Fools are EVERYWHERE!"

He wasn&rsquo;t sitting up. He didn&rsquo;t seem to be using his right arm and hand. After countless appointments with the family doctor, they saw a pediatrician &mdash; and with that first CT scan came the diagnosis they weren&rsquo;t prepared for. Ethan had suffered&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>a stroke</strong>.</p><p>It might have happened before Ethan was born or soon after. There&rsquo;s really no way to tell. The family was in shock &ndash; they had thought strokes only happened to elderly people. At first, the family was told to expect the worst: that Ethan might never speak, that he might not walk.</p><p>The next few months were a blur of MRIs, occupational and physiotherapy therapy, fittings for leg and foot orthotics and hand splints. Then in 2010, Melissa saw an article in the local paper about Heart &amp; Stroke-funded researcher Dr. Adam Kirton at the Alberta Children&rsquo;s Hospital pediatric stroke program. There was a picture of him working with a young stroke survivor to further his rehabilitation &mdash; something Ethan really needed. &ldquo;I knew that if I had to go to the hospital with that picture in my hand to track this man down, I would,&rdquo; says Melissa.</p><p>The Deck family learned that Ethan&rsquo;s situation wasn&rsquo;t actually all that unique: pediatric stroke &mdash; either in the womb or in the first 28 days of life &mdash; occurs once in every 4,000 live births.</p><p>Within three months, Ethan and Melissa were meeting regularly with Dr. Kirton and have been working with him ever since, trying to build new pathways in Ethan&rsquo;s brain. For example, Ethan&rsquo;s left arm was casted from fingertip to elbow to force him to use his affected right side. This built new pathways in Ethan&rsquo;s brain until it became automatic for him to go to his right side.</p><p>Dr. Kirton&rsquo;s clinical trials, which are a bit like day camps, are all about improving the motor function of children affected by stroke. The imaging technology he uses to map the brain helps his team develop new treatment options for children &mdash; and so far the results are really promising. Kids are gaining mobility, independence and confidence, and this work is leading to further research, education and support systems for children and their parents.</p><p>&ldquo;I think if there&rsquo;s a message for Canadians in Ethan&rsquo;s story, it&rsquo;s this: stroke can happen to a person of any age, and research is tremendously important,&rdquo; says Melissa. <a href=""http://www.heartandstroke.ca/stroke/stroke-news/life-after-stroke"">Read more</a> about Heart &amp; Stroke-funded research that supports recovery for Canadians who have had a stroke.</p>"	"public://org_profile/HS-CLN-WHY-Img_family photo.jpg"	"Picture of father giving son a ride on his back while wife and mother gazes on happily in the background"	"We give children and youth the best start for a long, healthy life"	"<p><strong>Saving moments.

It took years to&nbsp;figure out what was wrong, because she wasn&rsquo;t considered to&nbsp;be in a high risk group. A couple of months later, she came&nbsp;to HIV Community Link. &ldquo;When I got here I was treated very&nbsp;well, there was not judgement, no stigma&rdquo;, says Ann.&nbsp;Before living on the street, Ann had worked in an office for&nbsp;years. &rdquo;I was on the street from 2004 to 2008. I can understand&nbsp;now how it happens. It&rsquo;s very easy. They say one paycheck&nbsp;away is what a lot of people are at right now from living on&nbsp;the street,&rdquo; says Ann, who is happy she doesn&rsquo;t have to be&nbsp;worried about her basic needs anymore. She adds that HIV&nbsp;Community Link helped her with her Assured Income for the&nbsp;Severely Handicapped (AISH) and housing applications. But&nbsp;the most important part, she says, is &ldquo;coming and meeting&nbsp;people, people that you didn&rsquo;t have to be afraid to say you&nbsp;are HIV positive. I use the many services offered at HIV Community Link for people living with HIV including counselling, massage,&nbsp;acupuncture, food hampers, Friday lunches, laundry machines&nbsp;and attending conferences. This helps people to live with&nbsp;their condition and cope with it,&rdquo; shares Ann, adding that it&rsquo;s&nbsp;really important to educate health professionals so everybody&nbsp;gets tested, not just those who are considered to be at a&nbsp;greater risk. &ldquo;HIV is everyone&rsquo;s disease.

"303"	"HomeFront Society for the Prevention of Domestic Violence"	"10"	"<p>My story is one of perseverance and strength.</p><p>I married Brian, the man of my dreams, and quickly found out I made a mistake. My life was a fairy-tale alright, just one told from the side of the villain. I felt trapped, yet mesmerized by a type of magic that held me there &ndash; really it was wanting to believe that he could change and that things would be different.</p><p>With frequent beatings and never being good enough, I endured and existed with each day eating away at my self-confidence and self-worth.</p><p>In 2010, the beating was particularly severe so I called 911. From this call, I was connected with HomeFront and this is when my life started to change.</p><p>I wasn&rsquo;t ready to leave at this time, but HomeFront stayed with me &ndash; checking in with me to see if I was safe, and listening to where I was and what I needed. At first, Brian&rsquo;s power and control over me seemed to dictate my future and I had trouble seeing a life without him.</p><p>In 2012, the beatings escalated &ndash; only now I was pregnant. For the first time I felt a sense of panic and urgency &ndash; I needed this child to be safe and the only way was to leave. HomeFront was there to help me create a safety plan and relocate to another province. I still keep in touch with HomeFront as they continue to listen, support me and help me stay safe.</p><p>I had a baby boy. I&rsquo;m a happy, independent mom and a woman who feels dignified and respected.</p><p>HomeFront&rsquo;s support opened my eyes to a life free from abuse. With HomeFront, I began to believe in myself and honour the strength I now realize I always had. I am grateful to HomeFront. Best of all, I&rsquo;m raising my son in a safe and healthy home, and together we are living our very own happily ever after. Thank you, HomeFront!</p><p>----- &nbsp;</p><p><strong>HISTORY |</strong>&nbsp;In 1990, representatives from a variety of community organizations within the domestic violence sector got together to form the Mayor&rsquo;s Task Force on Community and Family Violence.&nbsp;This project brought together 60 community groups within the sector with the common goal of launching a specialized domestic violence court in Calgary. By 2000, Calgary instated Alberta&rsquo;s first specialized domestic court. Thirteen years later, the program is still around and is still committed to ensuring perpetrators take accountability for their actions. Today this program is known as HomeFront.</p><p>HomeFront was one of the first organizations to bring together all of the individuals and organizations connected to the justice system. Initially, HomeFront supported 1,000 perpetrators and the individuals they&rsquo;d victimized. Today, HomeFront has more than 30 staff members, 20 volunteers and a $3.5 million budget.</p><p>HomeFront&rsquo;s committed partners and dedicated employees continually strive to instate different programs that address the needs of all individuals affected by domestic violence.&nbsp;Within the last year, HomeFront has focused on expanding its Domestic Conflict Response Team, which provides intervention and referral service for individuals dealing with chronic or high-risk incidents of domestic violence where charges have not been laid.</p><p>The High Risk Management Initiative, which provides risk assessment, risk management and intense intervention strategies for high-risk cases, is also in the process of expanding. Soon these programs will be serving the entire city.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"	"public://org_profile/Image 39.jpg"	"We help to change lives..."	"We help to change lives..."	"<p>HomeFront is creating safe communities by eliminating domestic violence through direct client services, justice coordination, and facilitating community action. At our core, HomeFront is based on collaboration. We work alongside the courts, judges, lawyers, police, child services, shelters and local treatment agencies to ensure victims and their families have the opportunity to move their lives in a positive and healthy direction and break the cycle of abuse.</p><p><strong>VISION | </strong>Together with our partners, HomeFront is working towards a common vision to significantly reduce the incidence and repeat nature of domestic violence in Calgary.</p><p><strong>IMPACT | </strong>We are an integrated part of the justice system, and since the inception of HomeFront, domestic violence re-offence rates in Calgary have been cut in half and victim engagement in the justice process has more than doubled.

Generally in these cases, calls have been made to the police, but no charges were laid. &nbsp;The Domestic Conflict Response Team works with families in their homes to provide early intervention in order to interrupt the cycle of abuse at its early stages. They help connect families to the proper resources and referrals for community services and treatment programs, provide safety planning, and any other supports they might require to improve safety and prevent future incidents of domestic violence.</p><p><strong>The Domestic Violence Intervention and Resource Team (DVIRT)</strong>&nbsp;supports victims of domestic violence after charges are laid and the case is entering the justice system.

The right home, with the right support, has given him a second chance. A severe anxiety attack left Bob hospitalized for seven weeks, broken and uncomfortable in his own skin. A successful businessman for 25 years, he had it all &mdash; a beautiful wife and son, a magnificent home, a Mercedes. He was the last person anyone expected to fall apart. The anxiety attack changed his life forever.</p><p>While Bob was in the hospital, his wife drained every last cent from their bank accounts and vanished, leaving him with only his car, his stereo and a chair. He tried to go back to work after his release but the pressure of his prominent position was too steep a hill for him to climb without proper support.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t eat or sleep.

As a provider of affordable housing with nearly forty years of experience, Horizon Housing has been successful serving tenants with a variety of special needs including individuals living with mental health challenges, physical disabilities, families and seniors living below the poverty line and the working poor. Tenants enjoy a home free of judgement, full of hope and surrounded by a community of mutual respect and support.</p><p><strong>We are proud to provide residential rental housing that is appropriate, affordable, integrated and supported.</strong></p><p>Throughout the years, Horizon Housing has seen the benefit of partnering with various support agencies to offer homes to individuals living with special needs.

We now offer homes to individuals living with mental health challenges, physical disabilities, brain injuries, families and seniors living below the poverty line and the working poor.</p><p>Partnerships are vital to the work we do. Our support agency partners refer tenants to us and provide needed supports, such as case management and counseling, to ensure each tenant is able to successfully integrate into community and sustain their housing long-term.&nbsp; By combining support programs of our partner agencies with the stability of a home, our tenants can work through life&rsquo;s challenges and begin to contribute to a community that grows healthier and more vibrant as a result of their success. We believe the foundation of our success and the success of our tenants in making homes with us is possible when we can provide safe, secure and supported homes.</p><p>Horizon Housing owns and manages 15&nbsp; different residences in Calgary (eight group homes and seven apartment buildings). These residences provide a safe home to over 700 tenants. We promote a mixed-use, integrated concept for our apartments, which promotes community integration and reduces the stigma attached to a particular group while enhancing the quality of life for our tenants. Our buildings are our trademake of care, competence and experienced property management.</p><p>Horizon Housing Society is known as an experienced, professional operator and a leader in the affordable housing sector.&nbsp; Our professional policies and practices demonstrate our commitment to providing quality homes and remaining a welcome neighbour in the communities we operate.</p><p><strong>Our Accomplishments: </strong>In 2013, Horizon Housing Society won Calgary Residential Rental Associations&rsquo; Building of the Year (100+ units) award for our Alice Bissett Place property in Inglewood.

She was 36 years old and had no prior health problems. At the time, my oldest daughter, Lynn, was&nbsp;four and my youngest daughter, Katie, was one. Our lives were turned upside down that day, and changed forever.</p><p>Looking back, I can honestly say that the first two years after Diane&#39;s passing were a blur. I was in survival mode - running around at 100 mph, trying to work full time, run a household and be both mom and dad&nbsp;for my girls. I was especially worried about Lynn and how her mom&#39;s passing would affect her, as she was old enough to know exactly what had happened to her mom. I knew I needed to seek counselling for her immediately - thank goodness for Hospice Calgary!</p><p>Today we are doing well. We&#39;ve come a long way in the last four years - thanks to Hospice Calgary. Sure, there are still tough days when we miss Diane dearly. But what the Hospice has taught us is it&rsquo;s okay to have those days - it&#39;s natural. That grief has no timetable and everyone deals with their&nbsp;grief in their own unique ways. I&#39;m so grateful for everything Hospice Calgary has done and continues to do for me and my girls.

The Neurosequential Model is not a specific therapeutic technique or intervention; it is a way to organize a child&rsquo;s history and current functioning. The goal of this approach is to structure assessment of a child, the understanding&nbsp;of the primary problems, identification of key strengths and the application of interventions (educational, enrichment and therapeutic) in a way that will help family, educators, therapists and related professionals best meet the needs of the child.</p><p>Following more than two years of intensive certification and thousands of personnel hours dedicated to master the core concepts and implement the Neurosequential Model of Therapeutics (NMT) in their clinical setting, Hull Services was invited to become a Flagship Site for the ChildTrauma Academy (CTA)&nbsp;in the Neurosequential Model of Therapeutics.

It began with volunteer staff in an office space donated by Mount Royal College and was the first incorporated settlement agency in the Calgary area. In 1981 and 1982 following increased funding from the government, CIAS began advocating for more ethno-cultural staff in mainstream agencies. Additionally, they began expanding public education and outreach activities and with an emphasis on providing first language supportive counseling to new immigrants.</p><p>n 1997, as part of its 20th anniversary celebration, the Calgary Immigrant Aid Society launched the first Immigrants of Distinction Awards (IDA) with Dr. Martha Cohen, Order of Canada, as the Honorary Chair. The Immigrants of Distinction Awards continue to this day, recognizing the diverse talents among newcomers to Canada as well as celebrating diversity in the workplace. These awards exemplify the agency&rsquo;s commitment to promote the benefits of a diverse society. In 2007, as part of the 30th anniversary celebrations, Calgary Immigrant Aid Society became Immigrant Services Calgary.</p><p>We are dedicated to putting immigrants first and providing a range of services to help them settle into their new lives and community.</p><ul><li>We remain committed to accessibility, community consultation, partnership and collaboration and the ongoing process of self-assessment and evaluation. These principles enable the agency to continue to creatively and effectively meet the diverse needs of an expanding immigrant and refugee population.</li></ul>"	"public://org_profile/ISC Pic 1.jpg"	"Helping newcomers feel at home in Canada"	"Helping newcomers feel at home in Canada"	"<p><strong>Three service departments work with immigrants and their families: </strong></p><p><a href=""http://immigrantservicescalgary.ca/how-can-we-help/newcomer-support""><strong>Settlement and Language Bank Centre</strong></a></p><ul><li>Support for newcomers to adjust to life in Canada</li><li>Information about community resources and referrals</li><li>Weekly group orientation sessions</li><li>Interpretation and translation services</li><li>Civic education and citizenship classes</li><li>Employment workshops, information, and programming</li><li>Volunteer opportunities for newcomers and Canadians</li><li>Mentorship opportunities</li><li>Community-based programs</li><li>Seniors&rsquo; program</li><li>Supportive counseling</li></ul><p><a href=""http://immigrantservicescalgary.ca/how-can-we-help/english-language-information""><strong>Immigrant Language and Vocational Assessment-Referral Centre </strong></a></p><ul><li>Assessment of English proficiency and first-language literacy skills</li><li>LINC/ESL eligibility assessment, information and referral</li><li>Career, educational, and vocational planning</li><li>Referral to support services</li><li>Workshops and information sessions on skills training/bridging and upgrading programs, accreditation procedures, apprenticeship and other related topics</li></ul><p><a href=""http://immigrantservicescalgary.ca/how-can-we-help/family-support""><strong>Mosaic Family Resource Centre</strong></a></p><ul><li>Pre- and post-natal programs</li><li>Early childhood and preschool programs</li><li>Literacy programs</li><li>Afterschool and Youth programs</li><li>Family support programs</li><li>Parent support groups</li><li>Counselling Services</li></ul><p><a href=""http://immigrantservicescalgary.ca/how-can-we-help/community-awareness""><strong>Other work includes</strong></a></p><ul><li>First-language support</li><li>Advocacy</li><li>Public education</li><li>Community development</li><li>Pre-arrival support</li></ul>"	"public://profiles/ISC Pic 3.jpg"	"Three services departments offer supportive programs and services.

Patricia was in an extremely abusive relationship and addicted to alcohol. It was time to change.</em></p><p><em>Determined to create a better life for herself and her five children, Patricia found the courage to leave this abusive relationship and address her own problems with alcohol. She and her children came to Calgary to find a better life... W</em><em>ith the Inn&rsquo;s facilitation, Patricia completed a residential treatment program for alcoholism, numerous parenting courses, extensive counselling, and she experienced a lot of personal growth. Her children were returned to her care and&nbsp;this family is doing well in a home of their own.</em></p><p><em>Patricia started school in September 2014 and hopes to become a youth worker.

They come at all hours of the day and night, with little more than they can carry and occasionally, with only their pajamas as clothing. Inn from the Cold staff jump to action immediately. After the registration and assessment process is complete, the family transitions to their sleeping accommodations in our emergency family shelter. They are given new clothing, toiletries, blankets, sheets and each child is given a toy. And this is only the very beginning of the support that we offer families&hellip;</p><p>During the bitterly cold winter of 1996/7, St. Stephen&rsquo;s Anglican Church opened its doors to provide shelter and hope to Calgary&rsquo;s homeless families and others in need. In October 2008, Inn from the Cold opened Calgary&rsquo;s first Emergency Family Shelter, located in the heart of the Beltline community. For families going through the stress and trauma of being homeless or who are at imminent risk of homelessness, the Inn offers the programs and supports required so they can begin to stabilize and rebuild their lives.&nbsp;</p>"	"public://org_profile/Our Impact_1.jpg"	""	"Striving for a community where no family is homeless"	"<p>Our mission is to provide emergency shelter, support and programs to homeless children, their families and others in need, with the goal of building healthy, stable families and ending homelessness. Our vision is a community where no family is homeless. We are our community&rsquo;s response to families in need of support, housing and hope during times of crisis. Our priority is to help families find safe, affordable and appropriate housing.</p><p>In 2014, over 2,200 individuals have sought shelter services at the Inn, of which 1,244 were children. This statistic reveals a drastic 130% increase in the demand for services over 2013. For the hundreds of families seeking shelter at the Inn, there is simply nowhere else to go. The need for support is greater than ever before.</p><p>The growth of family homelessness provincially and nationally has been a central issue for planning, discussion, and response since 2011, but a number of significant contextual factors have contributed to moving this from concern to crisis. There are many reasons why Calgary families become homeless, but lack of affordable, appropriate housing is the leading cause. Rising cost of living, divorce, job-loss, physical and mental health issues, generational cycles, vulnerable populations, abuse and addictions can all be contributing factors. Every story is different, but enhanced assessments delivered through a new assessment and triage program indicate that a majority of our guests are high acuity, suffering from a complexity of needs that have led them and their families to become homeless.</p><p>Of the families served in 2014, 75% of guests were first-time shelter users and 12% of respondents identified as chronically homeless.&nbsp;</p>"	"public://org_profile/Our Story_0.jpg"	""	"IFTC building on 11th Ave"	"<p>We offer shelter to children and families, and develop programs that aim to bring an end to the vicious cycle of homelessness. We support guests and their children to take important steps towards creating better futures by engaging them in intensive case management services and onsite programming. These programs range from an onsite Student Run Clinic to the Early Childhood Development program, which intervenes at an early stage to help stop homeless children from becoming homeless adults.</p><p>As Calgary&#39;s original and largest emergency family shelter, we provide critical frontline services &amp; intervention, including:</p><ul><li>24/7 emergency family shelter;</li><li>a community-based emergency shelter program;</li><li>coordinated &amp; specialized onsite programming; and</li><li>innovative assessment and case management services not duplicated elsewhere.</li></ul><p>Family homelessness is a serious and complex issue. As front-line service providers, we understand the unique challenges and risks that homeless families encounter. In consort with the Calgary Homeless Foundation&rsquo;s (CHF) <em>10 Year Plan to End Homelessness</em>, we are working with community partners and colleagues to reduce these risks, create new strategies and ensure services are not duplicated.</p><p>In assessing and triaging clients to determine appropriate services within IFTC and also appropriate referrals to service provision partners out in the community, we seek to ensure highest standard of service, safety, and security for both clients and staff/volunteers. Frequently the severity and complexity of issues faced by the family goes far beyond simply not having a home and therefore the supports need to be equal to addressing those. Predominant challenges identified through assessment processes include:</p><ul><li>Severe mental health diagnoses or indicators</li><li>Significant developmental delays and/or cognitive impairment</li><li>Active addictions</li><li>Severe physical health diagnoses or contagious conditions</li><li>Serious physical disabilities</li><li>Active domestic violence or threat of retaliation due to leaving a domestic conflict</li><li>Criminal history</li><li>Active investigation for child abuse/neglect (CFSA)</li></ul><p>Due to the holistic and ongoing support we provide after placing families in permanent housing, Inn from the Cold has one of the lowest recidivism rates in Calgary.

A review by the Joyful Magpie website describes the show as <em>theatre for the soul</em>, and goes on to say:</p><p><em>&quot;As Keir&rsquo;s story grows larger in its scope, so too does the connection between audience and storyteller. We become involved in this story that is, at times, difficult, but nonetheless engrossing. Keir captures our attention with his frankness, along with his sense of humour. And that humour is a reflection of Keir&rsquo;s belief that telling a story enough times weakens it. In other words, telling these stories is Keir&rsquo;s way of overcoming the experiences that have had far-reaching effects on his life.</em></p><p><em>And so, we remember that the stage can mean many different things to many different people.

How was I to deal with a fractured board and a community under social pressure? But, there they were&hellip; my neighbours, real people passionate about their community&hellip; unexpected allies.</p><p>Amongst them, those unafraid to feel, dream and act, was Jack Long, a well-known architect, planner and community activist. Jack gave me the courage to trust the community, to give considerate thought and act with compassion.</p><p>The result, the community banded together to find their unique solutions to complex social issues. In dealing with prostitution&hellip; they decided to&nbsp; help women trapped in the lifestyle, while police enforced the law. In dealing with inflated property taxes&hellip; they banded together to help those who could lose their homes by launching a group appeal. I found that given the proper support, the community acted with empathy and creativity. Those were exciting and powerful times that confirmed the remarkable capacity of caring for each other in community life.</p><p>A few years later, in my role as a church group volunteer, I met real people facing homelessness, like the hard working Perrez family, who immigrated here for a better life&hellip; but were constantly confronted with making ends meet to keep an apartment that they could barely afford. Inspired by Jack&rsquo;s strong belief in the power of ordinary people living in community, I turned to him to help. As always, he was eager to help, but sadly he passed away a few months later. The Jack Long foundation was founded to honour him and to harness Jack&rsquo;s belief in the power of community. Our goal was to make affordable housing a part of the neighbourhood fabric, to develop process that addressed homelessness and marginalization from a community perspective. Inspired by Jack&rsquo;s philosophy, and in his words we &ldquo;develop within that community the capacity to plan for itself&rdquo;.</p><p>We ran an experiment with one community, and it worked! A group of concerned people eagerly looked at the opportunities within their own community. They saw real people, not demographics. They saw Hazel who, at 80 years of age, would not find affordable housing within her community (that would meet her need for elder support). And they felt the loss when even one person was forced to leave because they could no longer afford to live there. They were able to see existing needs within their own community, and put a face to those desperately seeking the basic need for a home. THE RESULT: ELDERHOUSE, an innovative solution to ageing-in-place.</p><p>Naming the problem was not enough. We asked seniors themselves to help us develop a dignified, affordable, and respectful housing model, which allows them to age in their own neighbourhood. <strong>Why? </strong>Because we are serious about real solutions, and because real people tell us that studies &amp; reports are not enough&hellip; real people need real homes. And real homes are supported by real communities.</p>"	"public://org_profile/FullSizeRender 8.jpg"	"Engaging the power of community in YYC"	"Harnessing the power of community"	"<p><strong>&quot;...there is an infinity of possible viewpoints but the only one that can be said to be proper​​ is the standpoint, or viewpoint of the community itself.&quot;- </strong>Jack Long 1925-2001<strong> </strong></p><p>Jack truly lived&nbsp; his philosophy and had a profound impact on the face of Calgary in his roles as architect, planner, city councillor, and community activist over his four decade career. Avenue Magazine stated &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to find anyone else who&rsquo;s had such a profound impact on the face of Calgary in the second half of the 20th century&rdquo;. Jack was a visionary who was responsible for the design of the Calgary Science Centre (1966); he was awarded the Canadian Design Council Concrete Awards Program. The building remains relevant and is in the running to house Calgary&rsquo;s New Contemporary Art Gallery. Always compassionate, Jack was named Honorary Chief of the Stoney Indian Tribe due to his respect and work for aboriginal causes. Never shrinking from controversy, Jack successfully helped battle CP Rail in their attempt to relocate the railway tracks to run along the Bow River and along Prince&rsquo;s Island.</p><p>His passion for community activism helped community residents realize that they are responsible for the destiny of their neighbourhoods. He is well known for his&nbsp; work in his home community of Inglewood, which widely engaged community residents in planning for the redevelopment of their community as it faced its demise in the late 60&rsquo;s and 70&rsquo;s. Jack steadfastly fought for and defended the community&rsquo;s right to affect its own future stating &ldquo;To use the community viewpoint&hellip;This means the planning becomes a participational planning process, utilizing the viewpoint of Every Man the Planner&rdquo;. &ldquo;Every Man the Planner&rdquo; was the title Jack&rsquo;s Master&rsquo;s Thesis, which documented his unique work with Inglewood residents.

We are set to build a shared home, designed by seniors for seniors&hellip; something that belongs in every community. It&rsquo;s more than a building - it&#39;s about people and caring relationships, private spaces, lots of light, a friendly atmosphere, nutrition, and healthy living. A different perspective - a focus on healthy living and not simply managing health conditions. <strong>It&rsquo;s about people&hellip; not beds</strong>. It&#39;s not about the number of beds. That&rsquo;s for hospitals. <strong>It&rsquo;s a shared home</strong>. It&rsquo;s personal. <strong>Elderhouse is designed to build relationships, combat loneliness, and it&rsquo;s about belonging</strong>. Seniors are valuable; they have much to contribute; their home must be part of and open to the community. It&rsquo;s about community.

Representatives from the Canadian Jewish Federation of Welfare Funds, the Calgary Jewish Administrative Office, Calgary B&rsquo;nai Brith, National Council of Jewish Women, and the Jewish Relief Society met to discuss the establishment of the social service agency</p><p>JFSC began in September 1960 as the Jewish Family Service Bureau. The Bureau was incorporated under The Alberta Societies Act in the spring of 1961. Operations started with the services of a volunteer social worker. Funding to assist clients was obtained from various businesses in the City.</p><p>An interim Board of Directors was set up and officers elected. The Calgary chapter of the National Council for Jewish Women anticipated the need for a paid social worker and dedicated revenue from its first two Angel&rsquo;s Balls to the hiring of the first paid social worker. The Jewish Family Service Bureau became a member agency of the United Jewish Appeal. In April of 1963, office space was made available in the Jewish Community Building and the Bureau formally opened for business. Since then, JFSC has grown and evolved; it now offers a broad range of services to families and individuals in need in Calgary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"	"public://org_profile/iStock_000013992794 family.jpg"	"Family"	""	"<p><strong>We offer Counselling, Education, Domestic Violence and Community Support services.</strong></p><p><strong><strong>COUNSELLING | </strong></strong>Jewish Family Service Calgary has a team of professional, qualified counsellors who provide a variety of services including individual, couples, child, and family therapy as well as group work.

She must have been so terrified in those initial days, to wake up in that state, with tubes all over, not being able to do anything but cry.&rdquo; &mdash;Naushad Hirani, Sofia&rsquo;s father </em></p><p>Days before her surgery, Sofia was jumping on the trampoline and performing summersaults in gymnastics class. While that carefree little girl is gone forever, your support and her fierce determination are helping her to rebuild a life after cancer. Sofia was four when she was diagnosed with a group three metastatic medulloblastoma, a highly aggressive pediatric brain cancer.</p><p>Following an emergency surgery to remove the primary tumour, Sofia&rsquo;s parents Shelly Bhayana and Naushad Hirani faced life-altering decisions about their daughter&rsquo;s course of treatment to come, while also helping her to rehabilitate and relearn to move again.</p><p>They researched the side effects of craniospinal radiation in excruciating detail and finally agreed to a regimen of high-dose chemotherapy in the hopes that it would eliminate the cancer and minimize the need for radiation.</p><p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, Sofia couldn&rsquo;t catch a break,&rdquo; says Naushad. &ldquo;Even after the &lsquo;atom bomb&rsquo; of chemotherapy she endured, her cerebrospinal fluid still showed cancer cells.&rdquo;</p><p>High-dose radiation was her only hope for survival.</p><p>But the very treatments that saved her life forever changed her life. Sofia suffers from treatment-related brain injury, which has caused mobility, speech, hearing and neurocognitive deficits.</p><p>But with months of intense physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy, up to three hours a day, Sofia has regained the ability to feed herself and walk with a walker. She wears hearing aids to hear and has learned to talk and write again. She is also learning to dress herself again.</p><p>&ldquo;Sofia works so hard to do the basic things that we take for granted,&rdquo; says Shelly.</p><p>Despite her struggles, Sofia rarely complains. Little things bother her like why she can&rsquo;t run or pull on her socks by herself the way her brother and sister can.</p><p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, Sofia couldn&rsquo;t catch a break. Even after the &lsquo;atom bomb&rsquo; of chemotherapy she endured, her cerebrospinal fluid still showed cancer cells.&rdquo; Naushad, Sofia&rsquo;s Dad</p><p><strong>RESEARCH </strong></p><p>As with most children with cancer, survival has come at an enormous cost for Sofia. Roughly 75 per cent of survivors live with at least one chronic health problem and a third of these conditions are severe or life threatening.</p><p>With an estimated 30,000 survivors living in Canada today, the late effects of conventional children&rsquo;s cancer treatments are exacting an enormous cost on the survivor, the family and the health care system.</p><p>Naushad and Shelly know firsthand the magnitude of these costs.</p><p>&ldquo;Sofia will never be fully independent,&rdquo; says Shelly. &ldquo;And I worry. What if something happens to us? Who will look after her? How will this impact Shaan and Sonya? What about their childhood?&rdquo;</p><p>At age four, little sister Sonya already sees the enormity of their family&rsquo;s struggle. &ldquo;DiDi&rsquo;s older than me, but I&rsquo;m kind of like the big sister, aren&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;What did the doctors do to her mommy?&rdquo;</p><p>Your financial support is helping researchers in the Experimental and Applied Therapeutics (ExpAT) research effort at the Alberta Children&rsquo;s Hospital and University of Calgary to improve outcomes for children like Sofia.</p><p>ExpAT researchers are collaborating with researchers across the hall and around the globe to develop and test new drugs that will save children&rsquo;s lives without causing such devastating long-term health problems.</p><p><em>CAMP &amp; OUTREACH </em></p><p><em>&ldquo;The memories we made until this point were really blissful.

They understand that dealing with a disease like this is a long-term issue for the family and that support is really very important for many months, and even years, after a major event like this changes a family.&rdquo;</p><p>Thanks to you, Sofia and Sonya are regulars at our weekly PEER* program. PEER is an evidence-based exercise and physiotherapy program developed by a multidisciplinary team of researchers at the University of Calgary and the Alberta Children&rsquo;s Hospital.</p><p>During weekly PEER sessions, Sofia works with a one-to-one aide to rebuild her muscle and bone mass, cardiovascular capacity and immune system recovery, which supports her daily physiotherapy and occupational therapy routine. Thanks to you, Sofia and Sonya also enjoy our SunRise day camp.</p><p>Each summer, Sofia is a little more independent and a little more able to participate in a greater range of camp activities.</p><p>&ldquo;Kids Cancer Care is one of the few organizations that actually looks after families,&rdquo; says Shelly. &ldquo;This is the only camp Sofia can go to that provides a one-to-one aide for her. For kids with needs like Sofia&rsquo;s that is essential.&rdquo;</p><p>The whole family takes part in our weekend Family Camp at Camp Kindle and they enjoy our year-round Outreach programs, including the annual Family Ski Day and Polar Express train ride, courtesy of Aspen Crossing.</p><p>The Hirani children were overjoyed to meet Santa last year on the Polar Express. And Sofia was thrilled to go adaptive skiing during our Family Ski Day, while Shaan and Sonya skied all day. &ldquo;She was out there for two hours and she didn&rsquo;t want to come in,&rdquo; says Shelly.</p><p>Thanks to you, the Hirani children are able to get outdoors and be active together as siblings.</p><p>&ldquo;This is so important, because Shaan was older when Sofia was diagnosed and he really misses his sister,&rdquo; says Shelly.</p><p>Camp and Outreach programs also offer Mom and Dad a much-needed break, while providing an opportunity for them to connect with other parents in a supportive community that understands.</p><p>&ldquo;These kinds of events give our family a sense of belonging,&rdquo; says Naushad. &ldquo;And I think it helps our kids feel that there are people out there who do understand.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>EDUCATION SUPPORT &amp; SCHOLARSHIPS </strong></p><p>With your continued support, Sofia is able to see a tutor each week through our Education Support Program. During one-to-one tutoring sessions at home, Sofia and her tutor work on her reading and math skills, filling a critical gap not met through school or therapy services.</p><p>Sofia will always have to work exceedingly hard for the smallest of gains, but with your support and her quiet and fierce tenacity, she will continue to make progress. Thanks to you, she will receive the support she needs during her primary and secondary school years, so that one day she may pursue post-secondary studies.

Our programs are uniquely designed to meet the needs of the whole family at each stage in the cancer journey, from diagnosis through treatment and beyond. The Foundation is committed to changing the course of children&rsquo;s cancer by providing programs and funding in four key areas:</p><p><strong><a href=""http://www.kidscancercare.ab.ca/our-programs/camp"">CAMP</a>&nbsp;- You can help kids be kids again. </strong>Cancer is a frightening and lonely experience for kids. It shatters their confidence and steals their innocence. Our camps offer children a chance to escape the rigours of cancer treatment for days of fun-filled adventure with kids their own age. At Camp Kindle, they find friendship and new reserves of confidence and strength &ndash; along with a healthy dose of mischief laughter and fun.</p><p><strong><a href=""http://www.kidscancercare.ab.ca/our-programs/family-outreach"">OUTREACH</a>&nbsp;- You can help families escape the demands of cancer.&nbsp;</strong>Our family outreach programs are offered all year long. Whether it&#39;s a hockey game, yoga class or laser tag, our programs for tots, teens, parents and the whole family provide a fun, safe place to spend some time with other families affected by childhood cancer.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><a href=""http://www.kidscancercare.ab.ca/our-programs/research"">RESEARCH</a>&nbsp;- You can help give kids a fighting chance. </strong>Kids Cancer Care is committed to being a catalyst for groundbreaking research. Our investment in the experimental and applied therapeutics program at the Alberta Children&rsquo;s Hospital and the University of Calgary is making research into the most difficult childhood cancers possible, giving children access to new treatments where conventional treatments have failed. For some kids, this means a second chance at life.</p><p><strong><a href=""http://www.kidscancercare.ab.ca/our-programs/hospital"">HOSPITAL PROGRAMS</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;You can help kids heal.&nbsp;</strong>Our goal is to see every child with cancer in Alberta receive the best care without leaving the province, so they can be close to their family and friends when they need them most. By funding a range of hospital programs from specialized medical equipment to bereavement programs and educational seminar, we&rsquo;re making sure Alberta children with cancer and their families heal at all levels &ndash; body, mind and spirit.</p><p><strong><a href=""http://www.kidscancercare.ab.ca/our-programs/scholarships"">SCHOLARSHIPS&nbsp;</a>-&nbsp;You can help kids pursue their dreams! </strong>Lengthy stays at the hospital lead to missed school and missed opportunities. Cancer treatments such as radiation, chemotherapy or surgery may lead to crippling long-term disabilities that seriously impair the child&rsquo;s quality of life. The Derek Wandzura Memorial Scholarship Fund was designed with these realities in mind. Awarded annually to childhood cancer survivors in southern Alberta, the bursary gives these young people that all-important boost they need as they begin to follow their dreams. Kids Cancer Care also offers support for young people disadvantaged by cancer during their primary and secondary school years.</p><p><strong><a href=""http://www.kidscancercare.ab.ca/our-programs/scholarships"">EDUCATIONAL SUPPORT&nbsp;&nbsp;</a>-&nbsp;You can help kids get back on track!&nbsp;</strong>Survivors of childhood cancer often face long-term side-effects, which are complex and can impact their ability to learn and perform academically. Kids Cancer Care actively supports children disadvantaged by cancer, throughout their primary and secondary school years with tutoring and a range of other educational support services.&nbsp;</p>"	"public://profiles/little girl_small.jpg"	"Little girl"	"Little girl"	"<p><strong>Family Camp - Camp Kindle</strong></p><p><strong>Your <a href=""http://kidscancercare.akaraisin.com/Donation/Event/DonationType.aspx?seid=11316&amp;mid=48&amp;Lang=en-CA"">$10,000 donation</a> will bring families together at Family Camp</strong></p><p>Each spring and fall, Kids Cancer Care offers a weekend Family Camp, where families come together and enjoy family time with each other, miles from the hospital and the daily demands of caring for a child affected by cancer.

By investing in our Education Support Program, you can help turn things around for these kids by helping us to recruit and screen, match and retain specialized tutors. These tutors will design customized learning plans and meet one-to-one in the child&rsquo;s home for weekly tutoring sessions, helping the child to develop the tools and skills they need to succeed at school.&nbsp;</p><p><em>&nbsp;&ldquo;People need to understand that kids affected by cancer are going to be behind in school. I don&rsquo;t know of any child, who&rsquo;s had cancer, who wouldn&rsquo;t benefit from the Education Support Program. These kids need one-to-one help. They need repetition. They need very specialized, consistent, long-term support sustained over time. And they need patience. That&rsquo;s what these kids need.

These young people often miss more school and may fall behind their peers, putting them at a disadvantage when it comes to post-secondary education. Managing the permanent after effects of cancer and its treatments also puts financial strain on the family, making higher education a difficult option for some families. The Kids Cancer Care Derek Wandzura Memorial Scholarship Fund, an endowed fund at the Calgary Foundation, was designed to level the playing field for survivors of childhood cancer by offering them a scholarship to a post-secondary institute of their choice.

"717"	"Kids Help Phone - Alberta Region Office"	"13"	"<p>Young people in Canada have been turning to Kids Help Phone for help during their most difficult challenges for more than 27 years. Our Five-Year goal is for Kids Help Phone to be the most nimble, accessible, effective access point for young people to the support they need.</p><p>All too often, our counsellors hear from kids suffering from verbal or emotional abuse. These young people can feel worthless, depressed, and anxious. Some even start to believe they deserve the negativity.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s so important for these kids to have someone they can open up to.</p><p>Here is the story of a past service user who came forward with his story as an ambassador of our services.</p><p><em>Aiden&rsquo;s Story:</em></p><p><em>Kids Help Phone helps kids in Canada over 1 million times per year, 6 years ago I was 1 in a million. Today I reflect back to say thank you, to let you know I survived, and to speak out so others can also survive. </em></p><p><em>When I was nine years old my parents became divorced. Shortly after I became an outlet for my mother&rsquo;s feelings. At first it started with unrealistic expectations, and when I couldn&#39;t fulfil her expectations she would hit me. Shortly after that a new activity started... what she called &ldquo;special time&rdquo; locked in her room she sexually abused me, she made me powerless with threats that she would harm my brother, or even take my life. Special time became routine for nine more years... I grew numb, my grades dropped in school, I became a target of bullies, I felt like an empty shell labelled &ldquo;child&rdquo;.</em></p><p><em>In grade 12 I wasn&#39;t sure why I was still alive. Routines at home had become so ordinary I had no idea something was wrong. I felt my life was normal, and one day I casually mentioned some of the things that happened at home when one of my friends was explaining how she got in trouble. I remember the blank looks on their face after I spoke... I didn&#39;t believe it at the time but my life at home was not okay, and it should never be normal. That day was the longest day in my life so far... what started as a casual mention to a friend, became a conversation with a teacher, which then went to a school counsellor who made a call to child services. I felt I betrayed my mom, and I still remember my friend sitting with me during lunch as I cried, scared, lost, and confused. </em></p><p><em>I ended up living with my brother, safe from the routine... but not from the memories. I didn&#39;t know how to process the feelings and at that point it felt hopeless. That&rsquo;s when I found Kids Help Phone; I saw your number on the cereal box. I didn&#39;t know if you could help someone like me but I had to try. I was very scared on my first call but even though they weren&#39;t with me they quickly made me feel safe. I told you about my mother, I talked about how angry I was at myself and how I dealt with those feelings. You didn&#39;t laugh or judge me, instead you gave me hope, you gave me courage, and you told me I was brave. </em></p><p><em>You connected me with local counsellors I could talk to and you were always there on the nights I was overwhelmed. You gave me homework to keep me going, little tasks like listing what I like about myself or what I dream to be.&nbsp; When I felt alone you shared with me the idea of a &ldquo;chosen family,&rdquo; picking people I trust and can build a strong relationship with. Today I have a &ldquo;chosen Family&rdquo; that consists of my biological brother along with four sisters, a mother and a father. </em></p><p><em>On New Year&rsquo;s Eve you gave me strength to fight through another year, at midnight the first person I said &ldquo;Happy New Year&rsquo;s&rdquo; to was a counsellor named Sandra. </em></p><p><em>I came to you broken and alone, you helped me find the strength to keep moving forward. You were role models on how I deserved to be treated as a person. I want you to know I&#39;m much stronger now. In an analogy you once used, I&#39;m in the driver&rsquo;s seat now and the past memories no longer fill my rear view mirror. So many amazing things have happened that they are only minor bumps in the distance. I have a growing career; I&#39;ve gone back to my high school and spoken on hope. I&#39;ve had the opportunity to tell kids about Kids Help Phone and I will always be a volunteer in order to encourage kids to always raise their voice. I am truly thankful for Kids Help Phone being there... for me, 1 in a million...

Consider that since 2013, there has been:</p><ul><li>29% increase in counselling sessions from young people struggling with mental and emotional health concerns;</li><li>22% increase in counselling sessions from young people experiencing suicidal thoughts;</li><li>29% increase in demand for Live Chat counselling;</li><li>16% increase in callers aged 17-20+ who, in general, deal with a far more complex range of issues.</li></ul><p>These are just a few of the indications that young people&rsquo;s concerns are getting more complex. As a result of this, it can take us longer to respond to their needs. This means that, just as kids are struggling with their emotions and life challenges, we find ourselves struggling sometimes too &ndash; just to keep up with their demand for our service.

Through sport, they learn the values of teamwork, leadership, commitment and perseverance. However, for some kids, the costs associated with organized sports are too great, and severely affect their ability to participate.</p><p>I was one of these kids, but I was also one of the kids lucky enough to receive support from KidSport Calgary. This is my story&hellip;</p><p>My family arrived in Canada in 1994, as immigrants fleeing the Yugoslav Wars. My parents arrived here without any close family and knowing little English. They came from a place where they were successful professionals, and arrived in a place where their post-secondary education was not recognized.</p><p>My parents were strong believers in the importance of sport in the development of young people, and first enrolled me in organized sports at the age of seven. They registered me in water polo, a sport that was extremely popular in the former Yugoslavia. My love of the game would come very soon after my first practice, and my experiences with water polo would influence the rest of my life.</p><p>My parents were determined to make the most of their lives in Canada, and were in the process of earning University degrees for the second time as well as working jobs to support their family. In my early years in water polo, many of the costs associated with organized sport became too much for my family. In order to afford these costs my family turned to the services of KidSport Calgary. The assistance offered by KidSport would allow me the chance to work towards and experience high-level competition, and would become crucial in my development into a high performance athlete.</p><p>&nbsp;As the years passed, my parents would become successful professionals and my family would no longer need the services of KidSport. However, their support allowed me to take some of my first steps in my athletic career.</p><p>I have been able to compete at the highest levels of international Water Polo. As a retired member of the Senior Men&rsquo;s Canadian Water Polo Team, I have competed at three World Championships and two Pan American Games. Water polo has taken me across the world and allowed me to compete on six continents. I have also been fortunate enough to play water polo professionally in Europe for two seasons.</p><p>My success in sport, as in any success in life, can be attributed to numerous people and organizations that helped me along the way.&nbsp; KidSport is definitely one of the organizations that was crucial in my development as a young athlete. I am a strong believer in KidSport, and just one of the countless individuals that has had their life changed by the assistance they provide.&rdquo;</p><p>-<em>Oliver Vikalo</em>, <em>Retired from the Canadian Men&rsquo;s Water Polo Team</em><br />Currently, works for TEKsystems as an IT Applications Recruiter</p><p>KidSport Calgary and Area exist because of testimonials like this.

I am one.</p><p>We&#39;ve seen people die before our eyes, helpless to do anything. We&#39;ve responded to violent robberies, domestic disputes, homicides and suicides. We run into the dangerous situations that everyone else runs away from. We&#39;ve rang many door bells and comforted the families while telling them that their loved one has passed away.&nbsp;</p><p>The sights, smells, sounds and carnage of our job can haunt us. We are trained to have answers and control situations. &nbsp;It&#39;s hard to drop it all from your mind when you walk through the front door to your family at the end of the shift. There is a stigma around admiting help is needed to mental health concerns. Heroes aren&#39;t supposed to have emotional breakdowns, not in front of their families and especially not at work.</p><p>I tried my best to live a normal life outside of work, but I&#39;ve suffered anxiety over simple &quot;normal things&quot; that remind me of horrendous situations that I&#39;ve been called to. Sometimes I&#39;ve slept poorly and the pent up frustrations become overwhelming on my family.</p><p>My spouse was living a roller-coaster existence, never knowing when I would be called out, uncertain if or when I&#39;d be home. At home I was often disengaged, distant and really trying desperately to recover from the trauma of the job. My kids avoided me because of my anger. One day it became too much for my family and I found my bags at the door and told to get help. I realized I needed help but how do I do it without being judged or navigate thru the difficult depths of the situation I was facing.</p><p>I had heard of Legacy Place Society in it&#39;s support to First Responder and Military Families but I still didn&#39;t feel that it was something that applied to me. But stubborn me, I&#39;ll figure it out on my own. I don&#39;t need to talk about this emotional or relationship stuff to anyone. Guess how long that lasted.</p><p>Legacy Place Society provides confidential accommodation support for us. A quiet place, away from triggers that allows us to figure things out. Others also seeking this support understand where we&#39;re at as they too had to make this courageous step. &nbsp;We don&#39;t have to &quot;put on a happy face&quot; for our kids or hide away our feelings. We can freely speak about what&#39;s going on without fear of being judged or losing our jobs. This is a place where rest and healing can begin. &nbsp;A place of support and encouragement. &nbsp;</p><p>Yes the first days were tough, fighting the urge to walk away, fight off the fear I wasn&#39;t going to make it through this. But after wiped tears and conversations, and time with professional councelling, I realized I can and I will become victorious over this blip on the radar. Through tough decisions and behavioral changes, I&#39;ve grown stronger in so many ways, including going back to my family and sharing this new resiliency from within and sharing it with my co-workers. I realized for myself and also others around me, it&#39;s not a matter of if this same experience will happen but when. &nbsp;</p><p>I am grateful for the support and patience from my family and Legacy Place Society.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"	"public://org_profile/46570richmondRMCPfatal.jpg"	""	""	"<p>Our Peace Officers, Fire Fighters, Emergency Medical Services, 911 Dispatch and Military Personnel face frustrating and devastating situations on the workfront and then find themselves working hard to find a balanced life perspective on the homefront.</p><ul><li><strong>Our Mission: </strong>Provide empathetic support that builds resiliency individually and within our First Responder and Military Families. &nbsp;</li><li><strong>Our Vision: </strong>That all First Responder and Military Personnel have user friendly access to resources to build resiliency as an individual and/or as a family.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Our Values: </strong>Family, Empathy, Diversity and Inclusivity, Confidentiality, Collaboration, Integrity&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Our History: </strong>Founded in 1997 by a group of Calgary and Edmonton Police Officers who felt there was a gap between the professional life and the transition to the home front. There was a period within a year of several suicides within Policing in Alberta and discovery of situations where First Responders were having difficulties in coming home because of the stresses they were carrying from work. The sights, sounds and carnage have a way of building up within the human mind that is difficult to shake off. Sleeping in their vehicles and couch surfing at a buddies basement became a disturbing trend.

For unique circumstances in rural Alberta, assistance is assessed on a case by case situation.</p><p><strong>Peer Support Conversation And Networking </strong>- this consists of dedicated volunteers who desire to provide confidential and collaborative support in the areas of conversation about marriage, parenting, grief, spiritual wellness, addiction recovery, single parenting, anger management and journey thru PTSD recovery to name a few. No one should feel shunned, lonely or shame as they seek conversation about anything. The truth is, we never know what someone is going through until the conversation starts.</p><p><strong>Family Camps </strong>- taking time with family and do some fun stuff together &nbsp;- not at a mall but in a camp setting with nature and a multitude of activities such as canoeing, high ropes, wall climb, paint ball, horse back rides, camp fires, etc. Included are team building or youth resiliency workshops. The parents can also participate in informative wellness, marriage, or mindfulness assessments or instruction. The goal is creating memories and conversations that generate stronger family bonds.</p><p><strong>Family Resiliency Workshops </strong>- occasionally partnered with other like organizations, these workshops provide a variety of topics that could include mental health readiness, psychological first aid, spiritual wellness, parenting, special needs and marriage support to name a few.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Humanitarian Mission Trips </strong>- these self funded trips provide First Responders and Military Families opportunities to participate in outreach programs in other countries. Primarily, this includes house building in the Tecate area of Mexico or case by case situation with natural disasters. Participation with the house building (usually late March) includes involving your whole family in this incredibly rewarding build of a home for a family in need. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Education Bursaries </strong>- qualified individuals can submit an application to an education bursary that is relevant to continuing education in the field of work that supports the career/home front that is not already covered by the Services. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Benevolence Support</strong> - each of the Services have independent resources that support benevolence situations and inquiries should first go through the specific Service you work for.

As noted with the sights, smells, sounds and carnage associated with our First Responder and Military Community, it&#39;s critical that we as citizens help those who help us in times of crisis including creating stronger communities together. Ultimately, for the First Responders and Military, the challenges at times can be extremely difficult to transition through and doing normal family life can be tough. &nbsp;Suicides, family breakdowns, Post Traumatic Stress and Opertational Stress Injuries happen within the Services. We talk about the legacy of impact that is taking shape through good and bad behaviors and encourage drawing strength from the great accomplishments and extraordinary contributions that have been made while adjusting other areas of concern. Capturing and sharing with focus on transmitting personal and family values, core principles and life lessons with each other and with the family is important.

"369"	"LINKages Society of Alberta"	"14"	"<p>On June 1st, 2013, there was a big party in Downtown East Village (EV). Hundreds of people of all ages gathered for IG Day (Intergenerational Day) for dancing, singing, a barbeque and planting a community flower garden at Murdoch Manor, all organized by LINKages youth volunteers. Less than 20 days later, in the midst of mandatory evacuation orders, EV seniors scrambled to save their new garden from incoming flood waters.</p><p>East Village residents, most of them seniors, made up the largest single group of Calgary flood evacuees and would not return to their homes and belongings for almost two months. Through the ordeal, their young LINKages friends did their best to stay in touch and when it was time to come home, LINKages volunteers were there to help them settle in. Over 200 post-secondary students signed up to help with resettlement and made the core of what soon became University of Calgary&rsquo;s LINKages Club.</p><p>The evacuation and resettlement catalyzed the relationship between LINKages Society and EV. Seniors were amazed and gratified that young people would help them out and be their friends &ldquo;just because&rdquo;. The youth volunteers were moved to help and inspired by the courage, sense of humour and perseverance of the seniors.</p><p>Almost two years later, LINKages has grown to a real EV partner, collaborating with seniors, the East Village Neighbourhood Association (EVNA), The Golden Age Club and other community partners to offer community events like annual Remembrance Day ceremonies and monthly games nights. A Wii Bowling tournament at the Golden Age Club drew dozens of seniors who came to try something new &ndash; including a 94-year-old who stepped up to Wii bowl with her walker!</p><p>As EV seniors come out to LINKages events, they get to know their neighbours better, see what&rsquo;s happening in their neighbourhood and feel more connected to other services and groups as well. Friendships with U of C LINKages Club volunteers break through loneliness, isolation and sometimes mistrust some of the seniors may feel. And it&rsquo;s a two-way street &ndash; our youth volunteers enjoy their senior friends, learn from them and are inspired by them to be really engaged in their community.</p><p>Without regular opportunities to connect, youth and seniors can develop misunderstandings about one another that lead to ageism and disregard for the gifts each generation has. Seniors lose their place as mentors, models and companions to young people and young people lose the opportunity to learn from and care for their elders.</p><p>Many U of C LINKages Club volunteers are alumni of our high school and junior high programs, which train youth to be compassionate, responsible volunteers and dispel fears and misconceptions teens and elderly people may have about one another. Their friendships lead to a new sense of belonging, purpose and engagement for both generations and help make Calgary communities places where people of all ages can contribute their strengths, talents and enthusiasm now and into the future.</p><p>&nbsp;You can find out more about our community and school-based programs at <a href=""http://www.link-ages.ca"">www.link-ages.ca</a>.</p>"	"public://org_profile/Linkages2014-51.png"	"LINKages intergenerational East Village volunteers"	"LINKages intergenerational volunteers"	"<p>At LINKages, we believe communities lose vital talent, experience, energy, heritage and empathy when we lose connection with the people in our neighbourhoods. We especially lose when we forget how much young people and elders have to offer each other.</p><p><strong><em>When was the last time you had a meaningful interaction with someone significantly older or younger than you?</em></strong></p><p><em>Unless you work with elderly people or children, you likely would have to try really hard to find opportunities to regularly connect with someone from a different generation and you might even be apprehensive about doing so. Often, we don&rsquo;t live in the same city or even country we grew up in. Work and other commitments mean we don&rsquo;t spend much time in our own neighbourhoods. Families are spread out, young children and teens spend their time in age-segregated classes and activities and older people tend to become former neighbours when they move to retirement communities or assisted living residences.</em></p><p><em>To counter the trend toward age segregation and even ageism, <strong>LINKages makes meaningful opportunities for youth ages 12-24 and seniors to be friends and mentors to each other</strong>.

"An intergenerational visit."	"<p>LINKages Society of Alberta offers a broad range of intergenerational programs and services. With 20 years of experience, we are recognized as an expert in designing and delivering research-based initiatives in Calgary and other communities throughout Alberta.We partner with donors to offer these programs to our students and seniors free-of-charge, so no one, young or old, is prevented from participating due to financial barriers.</p><p>Each year, over 700 youth and student volunteers participate in our school-based intergenerational programs and we touch a similar number of elders and young adults through our community-based programs. Last year, LINKages youth and senior volunteers contributed 16,000 volunteer hours!</p><p>We build connections and community through:</p><p><strong>School-based Programs</strong> - junior high and high school students visit with seniors living in assisted-living facilities or retirement residences weekly or biweekly through the school year. Students are trained in how to be a responsible volunteer and they receive &quot;instant-aging&quot; training to help develop empathy and excellent communications and interpersonal skills through their LINKages experience. Schools and seniors&#39; residence staff member liaisons work with LINKages to help ensure the success of the programs.</p><p>LINKages Program Coordinators design and facilitate activities to support beneficial connections where each generation learns from the other. One of the first reactions from both ages is happy surprise at how much the other generation is just like their own.</p><p><strong>Tech Programs</strong> - LINKages offers shorter-term programs where student volunteers mentor seniors in computing and internet literacy. As with all our programs, these are designed to be beneficial and impactful to <em>both</em> generations. While the seniors are learning computer skills, their young teachers are also learning from their senior &quot;students&quot;.</p><p><strong>Community Initiatives </strong>- LINKages and the LINKages U of C club engage seniors through intergenerational events and activities in their neighbourhoods with an aim to decrease seniors&#39; isolation and encourage community participation. LINKages connects with local community groups, agencies and services to determine effective and impactful ways to engage youth and seniors on a regular basis to help strengthen communities and build their social capacity.</p><p><strong>Intergenerational Day (IG Day)</strong> - June 1st is IG Day! LINKages Society organizes events in Calgary that celebrate the joy of sharing experiences with people of all ages. 2015 is our 4th annual IG Day celebration. For the past several years, thousands of Calgarians have enjoyed IG Day activities at the East Village and Genesis Centre.</p><p><strong>LINK Outreach (Linking Intergenerational Needs and Knowledge)</strong> - Communities throughout Alberta understand the benefits of intergenerational programs, but for these programs to be effective and successful over time, careful planning and knowledgeable delivery are of prime importance. LINKages offers workshops, practical advice and support on best practices for implementing intergenerational programs (IGPs) to communities throughout Alberta so that they can set up their own IGPs.</p>"	"public://profiles/shutterstock_17416855_puzzle.png"	"Youth and senior intergenerational visit"	"Junior high student and senior work together on a puzzle."

And even when new immigrants are excluded, the numbers remain pretty much the same. For some, it is an <strong>embarrassing secret</strong> they keep to themselves, developing coping strategies to cover their lack of reading skills. For others, it is a barrier that keeps them in low-paying jobs, or even prevents them from getting a job.</p><p><strong><strong>Why do we Exist?</strong></strong></p><p>We started as a grassroots movement within the MD of Foothills #31 that became a non profit in 1998 and a registered charity in 1999. A small group of dedicated community members recognized the importance of creating a structure that would facilitate building a literate community&nbsp; within the MD of Foothills #31 where all community members could reach their potential. It has grown exponentially and faced&nbsp; economic down turns and the flood of 2013 which is one of the most&nbsp;devastating natural disasters in Canadian history, with creativity and perseverance. Programs and services focus on the community members of the MD however it is now recognized at a provincial level due to work done on curriculum development and training</p><p>We are a small non profit but have a large capacity because we strongly believe in the&nbsp; power of collaboration. All of our programs are done in partnership creating ownership of the issue &nbsp;and are provided&nbsp;in multiple&nbsp;communities or in the home&nbsp;to ensure accessibility for all.</p><p><strong>What is literacy?</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Literacy is more than reading and writing. It is the ability to communicate your needs and wants to the people around you and to understand what others are telling you. It includes listening, speaking, numeracy, getting along with people, problem solving, computer use and understanding and using different types of written material such as documents and prose. These are the essential skills needed in our society for people to live their <strong>LIFES.</strong></p><p><strong>A challenge that affects every Canadian&hellip;</strong></p><p>The literacy level in our communities and our country affects us all.&nbsp;<strong>The direct cost of lower literacy skills to Canadian business is estimated to be in the order of four billion dollars per year, and the total cost impact on Canadian society has been conservatively estimated at 10 billion dollars.</strong> This is only going to get worse!</p><p>Our world has changed dramatically in the last 50 years. Researchers believe in the next 100 years we will see 20,000 years of change and growth in technology. The Canadian economy will demand a highly skilled worker in the labour market.&nbsp; Technology and expectations of the present day employee continue to change dramatically and even at home there is an expectation of higher levels of problem solving ability.</p><p><strong>The reason for criminal offenses?</strong></p><p>On average criminal offenders have significantly lower literacy skills than the general population. Offenders experience literacy problems at a rate 3 times that of the general population. They are also 4 times as likely to have learning disabilities. 36% of offenders have not completed grade nine and according to the Correctional Service of Canada, the average education level of newly admitted offenders, serving two years or more, is grade seven.</p><p><strong>Families are the foundation of our communities:</strong></p><p>The health, safety, and welfare of entire families are compromised by lack of the essential skills. It tends to be intergenerational, resulting in poor academic performance, and higher school dropout rates among school-age children in homes where caregivers cannot read. The inability to read dosage information on over-the-counter and prescription drugs can be life threatening.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The principles behind Literacy for Life&rsquo;s work</strong></p><p>&ldquo;The family is the strongest element in shaping lives. It&#39;s the most powerful support network there is. It&#39;s where the cycle of learning begins, where the attitudes of parents about learning become the educational values of their children. Through education of more than one generation, family literacy programs build on families&#39; strengths and provide the tools and support they need to become stronger and more self-sufficient&rdquo;. (National Centre for Family Literacy &ndash; Kentucky)</p><ul><li>The first five years of a child&rsquo;s life are key to their development. Most early childhood development experiences take place within families and all parents can have a positive impact on the development of their children.</li></ul><p>&ldquo;It is important to effect an individual&rsquo;s literacy development early, but as literacy and learning is a lifetime process, &ldquo;it is never too late and never too early.&rdquo; Our family literacy programs impact on a child&rsquo;s literacy at the early stages as well as teach the caregiver the importance of their own learning to their success, as well as their children&rsquo;s.</p><p>We support adults in their learning and help them build essential skills for success in work, family and community.</p><p>The best learning takes place within positive relationships and environments.&nbsp; Learning should be fun and make sense.</p><p>It is never too late for an individual to make a difference in their own learning.</p><p><strong>Partnering in our community for success</strong></p><p>Through partnerships and networking Literacy for Life Foundation continually strives to find ways to support community members across the continuum &ndash; from birth to seniors.&nbsp;</p>"	"public://org_profile/support.jpg"	"People working together to build Essential Skills "	"Helping people build the essential skills for success in  life"	"<p>Literacy for Life is about more than teaching people to read - it is about helping people find a new way to live.</p><p>Consider the young single mom who had just moved to Okotoks, from one of the reserves, determined to provide a better life for herself and her two little girls.</p><p>When she told us her story we were amazed by the strength and courage it took to leave the reserve. Completely alone and without support she lacked ideas and knowledge on ways to change her circumstances.</p><p>We determined the best way Literacy for Life could begin was with our Building Blocks program. A trained Literacy Builder went to her home and together they designed a program that built on her strengths as a parent while recognizing her low literacy and lack of confidence. While working with Mom on reading and parenting skills the Literacy Builder quickly recognized the program length wasn&rsquo;t sufficient to give Mom the support she needed. We extended the program to give her the gift of time to integrate the new skills and strategies into her family&rsquo;s lives while putting other supports in place.</p><p>Mom&rsquo;s determination didn&rsquo;t stop there as she had a dream to get her GED and go back home to become a law enforcement officer.&nbsp;</p><p>Resolved to support her we connected her with a reading therapist (who normally charges for services) to identify what type of strategies could be used by a volunteer learning coach. The therapist recognized the uphill battle Mom faced. She was so moved by Mom&rsquo;s strength and determination she offered to work with the Mom at no cost.</p><p>There was one more challenge to overcome before we could start. Mom would need time for tutoring and she couldn&rsquo;t afford childcare. Determined to find a solution the Coordinator made a connection with a childcare facility requesting help in accessing the childcare. Not only did they approve a spot but they also provided a subsidy. &nbsp;</p><p>It was also during this time we identified that Mom was possibly dealing with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder. With her consent we were able to get an assessment that confirmed the diagnosis, providing valuable information on next steps.&nbsp; She needed more than we could provide and was connected to a home support agency that focused on life skills and parenting skills.</p><p>Today her story continues to unfold...</p><p>At Literacy for Life we recognize that literacy isn&rsquo;t simply about learning to read, it&rsquo;s about creating the opportunity to learn.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Some Highlights of our Story!</strong></em></p><p>1.&nbsp; Literacy for Life connects with over 1500 individuals annually in the MD of Foothills #31.&nbsp; We&nbsp;didn&#39;t miss a beat even after&nbsp;immersion into&nbsp;one of the most devastating&nbsp;disasters in Canada&#39;s history - Southern Alberta Flood 2013.</p><ul><li>Our core programs continued and as noted in subsequent points we continue to grow. &nbsp;Literacy for Life was able to support the emotional and social wellbeing of families and individuals through a variety of creative programs.&nbsp; Art Therapy, Community Clothesline Project,&nbsp;Color your Stress Away and increased service to families in the Building Blocks Program.</li><li>Literacy for Life was a leader in a cohort that was instrumental in bringing the Becoming a Community Builder Initiative to High River as well as&nbsp;the creation of &quot;Our High River&quot; a community collective.</li><li>Instrumental in facilitating the publication of the The Stories of the High River Flood Book. <a href=""http://storiesofthehighriverflood.com/"">http://storiesofthehighriverflood.com/</a></li></ul><p>2. &nbsp;We are excited to annouce the development of a new program called Natured Kids. &nbsp;It is an exciting program that supports parents and children through interconnection with nature. &nbsp;This program will be available for other agencies use in 2017. &nbsp;Natured Kids is one more family literacy program to add to our success in program development. &nbsp;Literacy for Life is a Co developer and provincial trainer for the Building Blocks In Home Family Literacy Program which is a recognized family literacy model in the province of Alberta. &nbsp;The organization has also developed two other family literacy programs - Pool Rhyme Time and LEAP - Learn, Explore and Play. &nbsp;</p><p>3.&nbsp; Developed, implemented and delivered an innovative literacy program called Building Brighter Futures. &nbsp;This program received a national&nbsp;honorary mention in Great West Life, London Life and Canada Life Literacy Award.

The Lougheeds made the House an important cultural and social hub for Calgary at the turn of the century, and so too our work to engage our community reflects this premise - making the site, and the heritage it represents, accessible and relevant to our diverse and growing city.</p><p>Lougheed House, a National and Provincial Historic Site built in 1891 and open to the public since 2005, contributes to the life of the Beltline community through arts and cultural programming and events, private weddings and corporate events, school programs, the heritage gardens and our diverse exhibition program and museum. Our total attendance grew significantly in 2016, reaching almost 100,000 visitors for both our paid indoor programs and events, and our free outdoor gardens.</p><p>The House was built by Sir James and Lady Isabella Lougheed for their growing family of six children. The family resided in the 14,000 square-foot home until 1936, and established themselves as strong supporters of the arts and the community. It is one of, if not the last, remaining pieces of architectural design of its kind on the Canadian Prairies today. It is managed by the non-profit Lougheed House Conservation Society.</p><p>We tell diverse stories about the past which helps us all to understand our community and our place in it. From the story of Sir James and Lady Isabella Lougheed&#39;s community involvement to the use of the House after 1936 by the Dominion-Provincial Youth Employment Training Program, the&nbsp;Canadian Women&rsquo;s Army Corps and the&nbsp;Canadian Red Cross Society, many perspectives on our past are available through the House&#39;s history.&nbsp;We provide access for all to Alberta&rsquo;s rich cultural heritage and foster contemporary perspectives on local arts and culture.</p><p>We offer spectacular flower and vegetable gardens (free and accessible daily until 11 p.m.) and indoors (with paid admission) we provide self-guided and guided tours, audio tours, historic interpreters (if booked in advance) and year round revolving exhibits, concerts and happenings produced in partnership with our cultural collaborators.</p><p>Our history&nbsp;<strong>is</strong>&nbsp;relevant to our contemporary community challenges, and it is the role of Lougheed House to be a dynamic connector to our past as Calgary continues to evolve and grow. &nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.lougheedhouse.com"">www.lougheedhouse.com</a></p>"	"public://org_profile/IMG_20170816_1149483 copy.jpg"	"Lougheed House and Gardens, a National and Provincial Historic Site in Calgary's Beltline."

Events such as book launches, educational talks, comedy nights, live theatre, workshops and film screenings offer opportunities for the community to connect, engage with each other, and actively participate in Calgary&rsquo;s dynamic and evolving cultural scene. We created 13 programming partnerships with our &quot;cultural collaborators&quot; in 2016.</p><p>In 2016, Lougheed House celebrated its 125th Anniversary via special programs and events, including our 125th Anniversary Party that drew over 1,000 people to our grounds in late July for outdoor music, comedy, crafts and culture.</p><p>We continue to engage our community through our core of active volunteers and members, and by reaching out to further ensure our offerings reflect the contemporary needs of our Beltline neighbourhood and wider community.

We have asked for help a few times before, and hope you can help to get us on our feet while I recover. I have a chronic illness, and latest round has hit me hard.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, a delivery tomorrow morning would be perfect. Sorry about the delay in responding - have been really sick and not able to sit up for email. Thanks again. Thank you so much for the food and good wishes. I&#39;m not able to eat much right now, but my children have already picked out what&#39;s for dinner for them and my husband.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;You guys keep me going, really. I am so grateful.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Some news. My illness has become life-threatening and I came about 10 minutes away from bleeding to death in hospital last week. Twice. And then they still couldn&#39;t get it under control in the OR. It&#39;s been a very hard week coming to terms with the seriousness of my condition and the experience of saying goodbye to my children in case I didn&#39;t survive (that&#39;s a conversation I&#39;ve never rehearsed, and it was hard. And my child wanted to talk about yogurt because she&#39;s cute and still so little). I&#39;m home now, and very weak and sick.&nbsp;My husband is exhausted and afraid. My children are stressed. I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m telling you except that you have always helped me and I have just begun to process what has happened.</p><p>Can we please ask for more food? My husband and children like everything but soup. I&#39;m eating only soup. I like the vegetable soup and convince myself it&#39;s helping to make me stronger.</p><p>Can I ask you something? I know my husband wouldn&#39;t qualify for help, but if I die can you at least keep him and my children fed for a couple of weeks? He&#39;ll need support and we don&#39;t have anyone and I&#39;d like to be able to tell him to email you.</p><p>There is always hope, so please send good vibes / energy / thoughts my way. Maybe this is the hard part we&#39;ll look back on when things are better. Thanks for listening. I hope it wasn&#39;t too much.&nbsp;Be well.&quot; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - <em>Those are just a few of Sarah&#39;s emails to our team over the past couple of months. &nbsp;</em></p><p><strong>At Made by Momma, we know that in times of crisis we can change the life of a family simply through wholesome nourishment and nurturing care.

"<p>Made by Momma is able to provide the assistance and support needed to maintain a family&rsquo;s physical and emotional health during difficult life situations. The families we assist have one thing in common; they are dealing with challenges and facing times of adversity. Some are dealing with illness, some are grieving the loss of a child or spouse, some struggle with post-partum depression, some are struggling to adjust to the demands of newborn twins or triplets, and some have lost their means of income. Whatever the reason, these families need to gather their strength to overcome the hurdles they face, and when faced with a crisis, families often do not have the means to plan and prepare healthy meals.&nbsp; Made by Momma believes wholesome nutrition is vital, especially during life&rsquo;s more challenging phases.</p><ul><li><em><strong>&quot;Since&nbsp;losing my husband, a month after giving birth to our youngest daughter, I&#39;ve&nbsp;been faced with a very&nbsp;difficult road.&nbsp;<em><strong>We built&nbsp;our life on what I thought was a solid foundation, only to have that foundation&nbsp;crack and crumble.

Connolly&rsquo;s condition was discovered when one of his brothers (Connolly and his brothers are triplets) suffered a concussion in a hockey game and entered a concussion study group at the Alberta Children&rsquo;s Hospital in Calgary. Connolly was asked to participate in the study as the &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; baseline brain which they would compare to the concussed brain. The MRI on Connolly&rsquo;s brain led to the discovery of his serious medical conditions.</p><p>Despite his diagnosis, Connolly never gave up his love of hockey and his wish was to join the Winnipeg Jets NHL team. He was especially excited to meet his favourite player, Adam Lowry. Connolly was adamant that his brothers be included in his wish experience and every time he was asked about his wish he requested that his brothers be able to do the same things he would be doing. When we asked Connolly why he wanted to include his brothers in all aspects of his wish, he said, &ldquo;I love them and also I didn&rsquo;t want them to feel left out as they are Jets fans too, though not as big a fan as me.&rdquo;</p><p>Connolly, along with his brothers and their parents, travelled to Winnipeg, where they were greeted at the airport by Mick E. Moose, a mascot sent by the Jets to welcome Connolly to the city.</p><p>Later, &ldquo;Chevy&rdquo;, the General Manager of the Jets, welcomed Connolly to the team and signed him to a two-day NHL contract, making Connolly the youngest Winnipeg Jet in the team&rsquo;s history! Connolly&rsquo;s mom said that watching her son on the ice, practicing with the Jets and hanging out with his new teammates was a priceless experience and definitely helped Connolly get over the loss of his own hockey season due to his health issues.</p><p>According to Connolly and his family, the entire weekend was &ldquo;more than we could ever have hoped for, or dreamed of.&rdquo;</p><p>Connolly is doing well and his family hopes that he will be able to play hockey in the upcoming season. His mom Aisling said that the memories of his wish experience help improve his mood, even on his toughest days.</p><p>Thank you to the Winnipeg Jets for their generosity and for making Connolly&rsquo;s wish an unforgettable experience.</p><p>When a wish is granted, it does much more than bring joy to a child&rsquo;s heart. For kids like Connolly, who are faced with life-threatening medical conditions, a wish-come-true provides them with strength to battle through darkness and gives them hope for healthier, happier days ahead.&nbsp;&nbsp;Be part of the magic and transform the lives of children facing life-threatening medical conditions.

Having tested positive for drugs, Jeanelle nearly lost her daughter in those early days, but was referred to the Youth Transitions to Adulthood (YTA) program and was given a last chance to prove she could turn things around. Since that day, Jeanelle continues to fight for herself and her daughter; living sober and building the life she had yearned for as a child.</p><p>Having grown up in foster care, Jeanelle knew that was not the life she wanted for her little girl. Neither were the abusive, unhealthy relationships that clouded her own life. &ldquo;<em>It made me realize that if I were to continue hanging around those people, the drugs, getting tossed around, where would I be? Where would my daughter be</em>?&rdquo;</p><p>Jeanelle now looks to figuring out how to juggle late night feedings with online classes and finding a daycare as her daughter grows so she can look for work. Being a parent doesn&rsquo;t come with a manual and a willingness to learn has made all the difference. &ldquo;<em>Being vulnerable and asking for help is one of the hardest things someone can do and Jeanelle has done that with such grace</em>&rdquo; shares youth worker Chelsi, who has been working with Jeanelle since she joined the program. &ldquo;<em>Going from living in a random vehicle, on the street, to maintaining a home and parenting her daughter, Jeanelle&rsquo;s transformation in such a short time is nothing short of incredible</em>.&rdquo;</p><p>Confident, yet humble, Jeanelle now knows what it means to work hard and see the results of those efforts. &ldquo;<em>My daughter is with the woman that gave birth to her, that fought for her and I&rsquo;m ready to do whatever it takes to continue focusing on what&rsquo;s best for both of us</em>.&rdquo;</p><p>Jeanelle&rsquo;s story is just one of more than 2400 lives of children, youth and families&rsquo; transformed each year through McMan Calgary &amp; Area&rsquo;s more than 20 programs and support services that evoke positive changes and improve the quality of our communities.</p>"	"public://org_profile/cropped J&A_0.jpg"	"Young mother watches over her infant daughter playing with her toes"	"Jeanelle was given one last chance to prove she could turn things around for herself, and her daughter."	"<p>On November 15 1975, Norah McNamara, John Meston, Jim Allers and Rick Newcombe, four graduates of Grant MacEwan College, opened a group home in the inner city of Edmonton. With a vision to evoke change and contribute to the community, these individuals sought to provide support to young people who required care.</p><p>The young people in that first group home were cared for within a family and home-like environment. The individual interests of the young people were fostered and visits with family were encouraged and supported. For these young people, the group home was not a placement. Nor was it just a place to live. It was a true home; a safe and caring place in which each of them was given the opportunity to realize whatever unique potential of body, mind and spirit they possessed.</p><p>This vision ultimately resulted in the foundation of McMan Youth, Family and Community Services Association as we know it today, a multi-regional organization serving vulnerable children, youth and families.</p><p>Despite our evolution, the most important things have remained the same. Guided and inspired by the passion and vision of our founders, McMan has grown into a strong and vibrant agency that remains committed to empowering people to build brighter futures and strong communities. Our Strategic Direction is focused on enhancing our services, expanding programs to address gaps in services and meet community needs and continuing to grow our expertise to ensure McMan Calgary &amp; Area remains a leader in evidence based practices.&nbsp;</p><p>During the 2015-16 fiscal year, McMan Calgary &amp; Area staff provided 35,500 service hours across more than 20 programs.

For example, what is the financial impact of wildlife on beef producers? What tools do municipalities need to effectively adapt to the impacts of climate change? Should we reintroduce beavers in some areas to increase watershed resiliency in Alberta? How do you stop animals from dying on highways and simultaneously increase highway safety for people?</p><p>Whether it&rsquo;s by conducting and effectively communicating robust science and research, or through community engagement and strategic planning, Miistakiis has a long history of getting individuals and organizations what they need to make real progress on habitat and wildlife conservation issues. Our work aims to inform decision-making, ultimately putting conservation in the hands of the people.</p><p>&ldquo;<em>Miistakis is routinely viewed as an &lsquo;honest broker&rsquo; of information and advice.</em>&rdquo;- Lorne Fitch, P.

These skills are often critical in supporting environmental policy development and land use and watershed planning, and many of their staff are considered experts in their field.&rdquo;</em></p><p>- Pat Letizia, Executive Director of Alberta Ecotrust</p><p>Working together is the key to success. We&rsquo;re proud of the relationships we&rsquo;ve built with numerous organizations that have ultimately resulted in healthier landscapes for people and wildlife. For example, our work with communities and government to identify and mitigate wildlife mortality and road safety issues along Highway 3 and Highway 1 led to an important relationship with Alberta Transportation that will see long-term conservation actions taken.</p><p><em>&ldquo;Alberta Transportation has finally acknowledged that vehicle/wildlife collisions are a significant aspect of safer roads in Alberta, and the reports that [Miistakis] did along Hwy 3 and Highway 1 are considered the guiding documents over the next few years as the Traffic Safety Plan 2020 is implemented.&rdquo;</em></p><p>-Don Snider, Alberta Transportation (now retired)</p><p>----</p><p>As we develop tools, we share them with other organizations to make their efforts more efficient and cost effective. For example, Our Road Watch on-line mapping tool (used to monitor where wildlife cross highways safely and where they are being hit) was built on an open-source platform and has now been replicated several times across the globe.&nbsp;</p><p>Another example is our <a href=""http://rockies.ca/guide/index"">Conservation Easement Web Resource</a>.&nbsp;Conservation easements can be a powerful tool for landowners looking to fulfill long-term conservation goals on their property.

Despite their value, wetlands continue to be degraded and lost due to habitat loss, fragmentation, pollution and climate change. In Calgary, 90% of pre-settlement wetlands have been lost. Wetland losses significantly impact biodiversity and ecosystem services important to human well being. Action is needed by all stakeholders to maintain and restore wetlands in and around the City of Calgary.&nbsp; Tied to this, there is a strong need to better understand the health of Calgary&rsquo;s wetlands, and to foster wetland stewardship activities.</p><p>To address this need the Miistakis Institute has designed a citizen science program called Call of the Wetland to document observations and calls from amphibians in Calgary wetlands.</p><p>Citizen science is a powerful approach to enable organizations to meet multiple goals simultaneously. Call of the Wetland aims to better understand the conservation of wetlands in an urban setting though monitoring of amphibians as an important indicator species, while also fostering wetland champions who are willing to take action to protect, maintain or restore wetlands. By engaging citizens in the monitoring process, we not only improve scientific literacy but the two-way flow of information about wetlands and the need for their protection. The positive impact within our community is therefore enhanced knowledge of Calgary&rsquo;s natural environment in an urban setting as well as an increased number of people focused on maintaining or restoring wetlands and amphibian species within Calgary.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Call of the Wetland will be launched in Spring 2017. We are seeking additional resources to continue to support a local coordinator who will recruit new volunteers and work with volunteers to submit amphibian observations and to support the citizen science data collection tools. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>How can you promote smart decision-making that leads to healthy landscapes, wildlife and people in Alberta?</strong></p><p><strong><a href=""http://www.rockies.ca/donate.php"">Donate</a>:&nbsp;</strong>Your donation helps us find lasting solutions to many of Alberta&rsquo;s environmental issues. <a href=""http://www.rockies.ca/donate.php"">Click here to donate now</a>.</p><p><strong>Get Involved:</strong>&nbsp;Is there an issue that you care about and that you would like to see funded?

On average, 200 are abduction cases, thousands are disappearances and over 30,000 children are considered &lsquo;at risk&rsquo; runaways (who we now refer to as Vulnerable Youth) who will face extreme challenges and dangerous situations once away from their home, including drugs, violence, human trafficking and homelessness.</p><p>Whether it is a disappearance, a parental abduction or a vulnerable youth, Missing Children Society of Canada supports families throughout their most unimaginable experience. The following is one family&rsquo;s journey with the Missing Children Society of Canada:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>One Closed File was 16 Years in the Making </strong></p><p>Two young siblings were reunited with their searching family in British Columbia after 16 long, difficult years. The brother and sister - whose names we are keeping confidential out of respect for their privacy - were abducted by their non-custodial mother. At the tender ages of 5 and 2, the young children were stolen away to the United States, beginning what would be a very long and damaging ordeal.</p><p>There was great concern for their physical health and safety - including the young girl&rsquo;s serious heart condition going untreated throughout the entire abduction. There was also the unimaginable emotional devastation forced upon them and their searching family. From the beginning, Missing Children Society of Canada had been actively investigating their abduction, following up on tips and connecting with the searching family.&nbsp;<strong>Nearly 16 years exactly to the day, we were thrilled to be able to successfully close this active investigation </strong><strong>and bring these children home to safety</strong><strong>.</strong>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t do this work alone,&rdquo; explained Ted Davis, Investigator with MCSC. &ldquo;The RCMP were very cooperative with us on this case, which speaks to the strong working relationship we have built with our law enforcement partners over the past 28 years.&rdquo; &ldquo;With the hope of creating a neutral mediator, the family was hesitant to have direct police involvement and approached us for help. Our law enforcement partners were open to working with us in this way, and as a result we were able to move the investigation forward and successfully reunite this family.&rdquo;</p><p>Yet our involvement in this family&rsquo;s journey is far from over. We will continue to support the family and the reunited young adults through the reunification process, including access to our Family Support Program. All of our services are provided free-of-charge to our searching families.The siblings, now young adults, are living back in their home in British Columbia. They are both doing very well -&nbsp;renewing their relationship with their fathers and updating their education.&nbsp;It has been a great relief to keep in touch with them and offer support during the reunification process.&nbsp;We are always thrilled to hear news from them on how the&nbsp;youths are happily adjusting and reconnecting with their family and loved ones. &nbsp;</p>"	"public://org_profile/MCSC-Logo-Canada Helps.png"	"Missing Children Society of Canada"	"Missing Children Society of Canada"	"<p>The disappearance of six-year-old Tania Murrell from Edmonton, Alberta, in 1983 was one of the first high profile cases of a missing child in Canada. The search for Tania received national media attention and inspired the first non-profit agencies to open their doors to help missing children and their families. These agencies focused primarily on public awareness and prevention programs. Search support was limited to basic poster distribution.</p><p>Seeking to take a more active role, the Founder of the Missing Children Society of Canada (MCSC) obtained training and licensing in conducting investigations in 1985.

"355"	"Mountain Standard Time Performative Art Festival Society"	"15"	"<p>M:ST was originally conceived and created by The New Gallery, one of Canada&#39;s oldest artist-run centres, to produce a bi-annual performance art festival. The term &ldquo;performance art&rdquo; describes art practices that originate from a visual or media arts background and involve the live presence of the artist. It can include happenings, public interventions, culture jamming, video, film, spoken word, installation, or live web streaming.</p><p>Earlier festivals and events from the 1970&#39;s onward (Workshop, Space for Space, Ex.120) reflected the support of a growing and diverse local performative arts community. Building on this tradition, the first M:ST was organized to celebrate this established arts community by presenting works from local artists alongside visiting artists from across Canada and the world. Spanning the month of April 2001, M:ST 1 featured over 30 artists presenting work within Calgary&#39;s urban landscape. M:ST 1 included workshops, lectures and panel discussions and created important dialogue between local, national and international artists.</p><p>As a result of the overwhelming success of the festival, M:ST was established as a biennial event. Since 2001 we&#39;ve continure to grow. Aside from the bi-annual festival M:ST also presents interim programming. This started in 2004 with M:ST 2.5 Grand Action, a three day seminar event that included studio visits at the Banff Centre, a panel discussion at the Alberta College of Art + Design, as well as a comunity party and networking session. In 2005, M:ST 3 expanded to a regionally-based event, including the participation of the Southern Alberta Art Gallery in Lethbridge and the Walter Phillips Gallery in Banff.&nbsp;</p><p>Since 2001 the M:ST festival has brought the works of over 250 artists to the Southern Alberta area. We collaborate with Arts Commons, Southern Alberta Art Gallery, Alberta College of Art + Design, TRUCK Gallery, Stride Gallery, The New Gallery, The Nickle Galley, Calgary Society of Independant Filmmakers, and EMMEDIA to create a uniquely collaborative and participatory environement. &nbsp;This collaborative structure allows the festival to represent each organization&rsquo;s mandate and audience, while providing opportunities for cross-disciplinary and inter-organizational exchange. The result is a unique participatory context, where artists and audience experience contemporary performative work outside of more traditional festival or gallery models.</p><p>Our objective is to showcase original, diverse, entertaining, and&nbsp;thought-provoking performative works. The term &quot;performative&quot; describes practices that&nbsp;originate from a visual or media arts discourse and involve the live presence of the artist. &nbsp;Presenting a wide range of media, M:ST&rsquo;s programming is responsive to issues in&nbsp;contemporary art, fostering discourse crucial for the growth and progression of&nbsp;performative practices and promoting dialogue through panel discussions, workshops,&nbsp;and dissemination activities.</p>"	"public://org_profile/WHY_HansOpdeBeeck.web_.jpg"	"Performing the Landscape proposes to look at new ideas of landscape"	"Performing the Landscape proposes to look at new ideas of landscape"	"<p>The mission of M:ST is to ensure that performative art practices are recognized and sustained in the Southern Alberta region.

"603"	"Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada - Calgary & Area Chapter"	"15"	"<p><strong>My name is Fiona Fifield and I was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis in September of 2005.</strong></p><p>During the May long-weekend of that same year, I was hit by a drunk driver. My symptoms started a few weeks after the crash. Prior to my diagnosis, I had spent three weeks in the hospital with a kidney infection, lost most of the strength in my left leg, as well as the loss of colour vision in my right eye. My diagnosis solidified what we were sadly thinking but not saying.</p><p>In my first few months, I found how fast my disease was progressing. I had my first MRI and the results shocked everyone. I had 16 lesions, four of them active disease. I had my second MRI two months later and was up to 19, with seven active lesions.</p><p>How I was feeling in those first few months? I was terrified! I didn&#39;t understand why my disease was so different from others in my family. My mom had Progressive MS and it slowly progressed over 30 years before she needed a wheelchair. My sister had Remitting Relapsing MS and had been doing well. Whereas I felt like I was racing to stay ahead of the freight train bearing down on me. Within two months, I had to move out of my basement suite as I was no longer able to climb the stairs. Within six months, I had lost my balance.</p><p>In my first four years living with MS, I failed three different disease modifying treatments including Cyclophosphamide, a form of Chemotherapy. In the fourth year I had paralysis from my waist down for six months. The doctors tried a Plasma Exchange during my time in Foothills Hospital. It also did nothing. The Chemotherapy did get me walking again, I was promised a year. I was told that when it stopped working there was nothing left they could do for me. The drug started to wear off within eight months. At this point my diagnosis changed to Marburg Variants, the only terminal form of MS. I went to bed on the 8th of April while still being able to pivot myself into bed from my wheelchair and awoke completely paralyzed from my breastbone down. I was raced into Foothills where within a week my paralysis ascended to my collarbone. I was on my deathbed due to my autonomic system starting to shut down and I was sent home and told that there were no more options for me.</p><p>However, then a series of fateful situations began to fall into place for me. Within a month I was accepted at Ottawa Hospital for an experimental treatment by Dr. Freedman and Dr. Atkins. The treatment was Autologous Stem Cell Replacement. This procedure saved my life, it halted my disease which nothing else anyone had done before could do.</p><p>To my knowledge, over $6 million went into the trial that turned out to have saved my life. (This trial was funded in full by the MS Society and MS Scientific Research Foundation). I wasn&rsquo;t a part of the trial but I was the 4th person in Canada that had the transplant outside of the trial. Dr. Freedman told me on our first visit with him that &ldquo;I was lucky to be the sickest of the sick.&rdquo; For any other person this statement may not bring joy but for this gal, who mere weeks ago had been given a zero chance of survival, I was overjoyed.</p><p>I owe my life to the Doctors, the people who participated in trials before me, but most of all to the MS Society for raising all the funds that went into the research. Fundraising has saved me and now many like me. If not for the staff at the MS Society and meeting Dr. Freedman, I would not be here.</p><p>I have since my transplant been a quadriplegic twice; once in 2014 and again in September of 2016. These little blimps are due to the massive damage in my system that may or may not heal over time. The nervous system is extremely complex and there is still a lot of research to be done into how it all works. I have not been able to go back to work yet. I am however attempting to change into something my body is able to handle. I do walk unaided most of the time unless fighting an infection. I am able to drive, walk, talk, and shake hands. I have been given 5 years of life that I would not have had. I enjoy meeting all the people that I would not have met if I was not here. I&rsquo;m excited to have found out that hair is nothing but an accessory and that I AM NOT MY BODY. &nbsp;</p>"	"public://org_profile/MSlogo.jpg"	""	""	"<p><strong>Through every area of our work &ndash; research to discover new treatments, advocacy to help people qualify for AISH or CPPD, support groups and social programs &ndash; we aim to help people live better with multiple sclerosis. </strong></p><p>Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic and often disabling disease, with no cure at present.

During its over 100-year existence, the Eddy had hosted icons, such as blues pioneers Pinetop Perkins and Buddy Guy and CanRock stalwart Bryan Adams, offering high-quality live music experiences while bringing people from all walks of life together. Rich or poor, black or white, politicians rubbed shoulders with music scenesters and bikers sat alongside corporate influencers. The Eddy represented the unifying power of music.</p><p>At the same time as its closing, the National Music Centre (NMC) had been scouring the city for the location of its new 160,000 square-foot facility. With a mandate to preserve and celebrate Canada&rsquo;s music story, NMC&rsquo;s new home needed to be anchored by a strong music story. The King Eddy was that story and without NMC that important story would have been lost.</p><p>Considered the largest artifact in NMC&rsquo;s collection of over 2,000 rare instruments, artifacts, sound equipment and Canadian music memorabilia, the restored King Eddy will be incorporated into the design of NMC&rsquo;s new home at Studio Bell, and music will once again ring through the Eddy as a live music venue.&nbsp;</p><p>When Studio Bell opens in 2016 at the site of the historic blues club, it will continue to be sacred ground for music lovers.

On May 29, 2014 a group of 20 NCC Conservation Volunteers came out to the Jenkins property in this area to demolish a bear attractant, an old grain bin, piece by piece. After tearing, hammering, shoveling and breaking the structure, the group managed to leave nothing but a shell of the original building.</p><p>Volunteers also worked hard to clear out the grain. A new bear-proof metal bin will replace the old wooden bin; a disappointment for the bears, but a definite win for the Jenkins family in their efforts to reduce the number of human-bear interactions in the area.</p><p>To see these NCC volunteers in action, watch:&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9vmXU8EIFg&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;list=UUEHsIQ2uDw_PThasY_hVpSQ"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9vmXU8EIFg&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;list=UUEHsI</a></p><p>To learn more about projects like this visit: <a href=""http://www.natureconservancy.ca/en/what-you-can-do/conservation-volunteers/"">http://www.natureconservancy.ca/en/what-you-can-do/conservation-volunteers/</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>"	"public://org_profile/WYCD Snippet Vol-Dec4.JPG"	"NCC volunteer pictured overlooking the view of the Rocky Mountains"	"NCC's first Conservation Volunteer event on the Waldron!"

"760"	"Next Step Ministries Society"	"16"	"<p>Abby called the Next Step Ministries emergency call line. She was desperately looking for a safe place to live and help her escape from the abuse and addiction she was currently experiencing.</p><p>Becky answered the phone. There was a frantic voice at the other end as she listened to Abby urgently telling her that she was running from a life of prostitution, drug addiction and a very abusive relationship. Her life for the last 25 years had been a living hell, she was at the end of her rope and wanted out.</p><p>Becky asked where Abby was and immediately got in her car to meet her at a fast food restaurant close to where she called from.&nbsp; When Becky arrived, there were many people in line waiting to order, but she immediately knew who Abby was. She was wearing an old pair of dirty shorts and a tank-top, her arms were marked up, she was skin and bones, her face was gaunt and had sores on them likely from drug abuse. Her eyes had a distant but desperate look in them. She couldn&rsquo;t stand still and was fidgety and constantly scanning the room.</p><p>Becky approached her and asked if her name was Abby and if she wanted something to eat. Abby said yes, I haven&rsquo;t had a meal in weeks. After talking to Abby for a while, it became obvious that she was full of fear and pain. Abby was on the run. Becky asked her if she wanted out, she said yes and Becky brought her to the Next Step Ministries house. When Abby walked into the house she fell on her knees and cried to God, thanking him for saving her and for providing her with a safe place.</p><p>Denise, our live in volunteer, showed her the house and walked her over to her room. Immediately she started crying again. It had been years since she felt safe and had her own room with a bed in it. Abby jumped on the bed, smelled the brand new pillow and hugged the blanket. It was beautiful to see this, but it was only the first step.</p><p>Over the following two days, we were able help Abby get clean underwear and some more clothes, groceries, hygiene items, and her phone changed so her abuser couldn&rsquo;t find her. In the weeks to come, we would also get her an ID card and set up on government financial assistance.</p><p>Abby started attending a program we provide to help break the cycle of addiction and abuse in her life. She started using what she was learning. The road to recovery for Abby was extremely challenging as she worked through the abuse that started when she was a little girl until she came to next Step Ministries. Even though she was in a safe place, she lived in constant fear that her most recent abuser would find her. At times her trauma was through the roof, but she stuck with the program.</p><p>She had a couple of slips, as most people do, but she was able to push through and has been clean and sober for 8 months. She has reconnected with her family and was able to get her children back in her life. She is determined to succeed and continues to go to Narcotics Anonymous meetings.&nbsp; She is doing what it takes to continue on the path of recovery and to ensure she never goes back to how her life was. Abby stays connected with us on a weekly basis and is now planning and figuring out what is next for her in life.</p><p>As we walk alongside women fighting so hard to escape their lives of sexual exploitation, their stories may vary, but they all come from a place of trauma and darkness. They are desperately searching for a way to live life with dignity and safety. Like all of us, they want to feel like they belong, they want to be good friends, good parents, good members of our community. They want to matter.</p>"	"public://org_profile/Our Story_0.png"	""	""	"<p><strong>Our Vision is for women to exit sexual exploitation and discover their identity.</strong></p><p>Next Step Ministries is a Christian organization that was established in 2010 by Phil and Jackie Reimer to help meet the needs of vulnerable and exploited people in the community of Calgary. Today, Next Step Ministries has four programs that work together to help women exit sexual exploitation and move toward a life of hope and healing.</p><p><strong>Our Mission is to walk alongside women exiting sexual exploitation as they break the cycle of addiction and abuse.</strong></p><p>The need is larger than what we first realized. In 2014, the City of Calgary put out a report called the Prostitution Response Framework, which states that there are as many as 3,000 prostitutes in Calgary. This, along with an unrelenting stream of women coming into our program has led Next Step Ministries to increase our capacity over the years in order to serve as many women as possible. With one house and the current size of our Day Program, we have been able to work with 30 individual women per year. With a second house to come online shortly, we will be able to significantly increase that number.</p><p><strong>Our Goal is to have a safe place for every woman who wants to exit sexual exploitation. </strong></p><p>Our Participants come to us facing many challenges. Each one of them has a history of being sexually exploited, close to 95% of the women come with a history of substance abuse, 100% require mental health support for diagnosable conditions (bipolar, depression, PTSD, and anxiety are the most common trends), they have a long list of physical challenges, and 93% come with criminal records and have an extensive history with law enforcement.</p><p>We track measurable outcomes for the women, but our ultimate desire when they leave Next Step Ministries is that they know that they are loved by God, loved by our team and that they have choices in life.&nbsp;</p>"	"public://org_profile/Icon-Outreach.jpg"	""	""	"<p>Our programs at Next Step Ministries are designed to help the Participants recover from their past and move forward with hope into their future.

We were fairly new to Airdrie and I was having difficulty raising three small children with a partner who had a drinking and gambling problem. The programs we accessed gave me new coping skills and my children a positive outlet during a very difficult time.</em></p><p><em>The support I received from the staff and programs helped me to leave an abusive environment and make positive steps to ensure a safe, healthy home for my children. Becoming a single parent I joined the Single Parent Support Group which gave me the opportunity to connect with others experiencing the same day to day struggles and joys. Through Community Links, my children have been given the opportunity to experience drop-in PLAY groups, youth empowerment workshops and summer camps. These have been extremely beneficial, especially for my oldest son. I truly believe that his involvement in the summer camps set him on the right path to becoming the amazing young man he is today.</em></p><p><em>Over the years, I have walked into the Community Links office overwhelmed with different circumstances in my life and the staff have helped me get focused and connected to whatever program, resource or other agency I needed (i.e. warm clothing, Mental Health support, housing, parenting).

After delivery, what was thought to have been a slipped disc in Emily&rsquo;s back, was diagnosed as three large cancerous tumours.</p><p>Unfortunately, with Emily&rsquo;s serious health complications and her starting chemotherapy treatments after Sullivan born, the decision was made to put Sullivan on pasteurized donor human milk from NorthernStar Mothers Milk Bank (formerly Calgary Mothers Milk Bank).</p><p>With Emily and Sullivan each receiving treatments&nbsp;in different hospitals, Justin was unable to continue working. Emily was undergoing chemotherapy while Sullivan had multiple operations associated with his premature delivery. Sullivan relied on pasteurized donor human milk to provide not only nutrients, but also protection to his fragile immune and gastrointestinal systems. Due to Sullivan&#39;s long-term hospital stay, he surpassed the age that the hospital would cover donor human milk, leaving his dad Justin to cover the cost.&nbsp;Justin reached out to NorthernStar Mothers Milk Bank and was accepted into the Charitable Care program to ensure Sullivan would continue to receive the life-saving donor milk his body needed free of charge.</p><p>When Sullivan turned 10 months old, he lost his mom to cancer.</p><p>Shortly after, Sullivan was able to leave the hospital and be at home with his dad. Because of his long term intubation, Sullivan built-up&nbsp;scar tissue in his esophagus causing it to narrow, making swallowing difficult. As a result most of his caloric intake was from pasteurized donor human milk through a tube in his stomach. He continued to receive&nbsp;donor human milk until he was 18 months old.</p><p>_____________________________________________________________________________________</p><p><strong><em>We encourage you to&nbsp;watch the beautiful video on <a href=""http://www.northernstarmilkbank.ca/give-donate/charitable-care/"">Baby Sullivan </a>and learn more about our Charitable Care Program by visiting our website.</em></strong></p>"	"public://org_profile/NSMMB_Primary_Image (smaller)_0.jpg"	""	"Every Precious Drop Counts"	"<h5><strong>Every year in Alberta, 1 in 11 babies are born prematurely&nbsp;</strong>(less than 37 gestational&nbsp;weeks)<strong>.&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>While the average term infant weighs approximately 7 and a half pounds, the smallest premature infants may weigh just over one pound. These babies are too small to breastfeed and are&nbsp;often faced with&nbsp;health challenges. &nbsp;As advocates and champions for healthy babies, we believe, and science endorses, that human milk is the best option for any baby and that all babies should have access to life-saving donor human milk. We screen breastfeeding mothers as milk donors, accepting their excess milk as donations to be pasteurized in the laboratory, tested for bacteria&nbsp;and dispensed to sick babies in hospitals and in the community.</p><p>Research shows &quot;that when the mother&rsquo;s own milk is unavailable for the sick, hospitalized newborn, pasteurized donor human breast milk should be made available as an alternative feeding choice &quot; (Canadian Pediatric Society; 2016).&nbsp; Pasteurized donor human milk provides the healthiest option to newborns and premature babies who spend time in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Many sick and fragile babies depend on the immediate access to donor human milk for its life-saving health benefits.</p><p>For women who cannot nurse as a result of a low milk supply, necessary medication usage, illness, adoption or surrogacy, we make it possible for all at-risk Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) babies to receive human milk.</p><h5><strong>The benefits of donor human milk</strong>:</h5><ul><li><div>Lowers infection rates by transferring antibodies to fight disease</div></li><li><div>Decreases length of stay in the NICU</div></li><li><div>Decreases incidence of feeding intolerance and diarrhea</div></li><li><div>Decreases the risk of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) - a potentially blinding eye disease that is primarily seen in premature babies</div></li><li><div>Lowers the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) - the most fatal gastrointestinal infection in the NICU</div></li></ul><h5><strong>&nbsp;Who receives our milk?

We want to give every sick and fragile baby the best chance possible.</li><li>Research supports that babies who receive donor human milk build critical immunity and are at a reduced risk of life-long illness. We should think of donor human milk the same way as we do medicine.&nbsp;</li><li>Donor human milk&nbsp;can help babies receive more nutrients, expedite healing and develop faster. It provides natural antibodies that help babies resist illnesses.</li><li>We need a community-based solution for babies in need.

In addition to&nbsp;pasteurizing donor human milk, we also offer Breastfeeding classes, Lactation Consultant Advice and&nbsp;provide a service to Bereaved mothers aiding in the healing process after a loss.</p><h5><strong>We are in constant need of healthy breastfeeding mothers and help from community partnerships:</strong></h5><ul><li><strong>Donor Moms</strong>: Milk donors are healthy women who have delivered a baby within the past year and who are currently breastfeeding or pumping their milk. They are not compensated for their milk and are donating selflessly. Our video &quot;<a href=""https://youtu.be/FYVSPbKCxao"">How to Donate</a>&quot; outlines how moms can begin the process of becoming donors. <em>Click <a href=""http://http://www.northernstarmilkbank.ca/give-donate/donate-milk/"">HERE</a> for information on how to donate.</em></li><li><strong>Milk Drops</strong>: Outside of the Calgary area, Milk Drops are available as locations for approved donor moms to drop off their donations. These partnerships with health regions and doctors offices are essential as they increase community awareness for milk banking and make it easier for moms to donate.&nbsp;<em>View a list of our Milk Drop locations <a href=""http://www.northernstarmilkbank.ca/give-donate/donate-milk/milk-drops/"">HERE</a>.</em></li><li><strong>Transfer of Milk</strong>: All of our donations are kept frozen until the pasteurization process. This requires timely transport using a variety of local and national couriers.</li><li><strong>Volunteers</strong>: We rely on volunteers to assist us in our day-to-day workings. Their time and effort allows us to keep our costs as low as possible and on track with the time sensitive production of pasteurized donor human milk.</li></ul><h5><strong>Pasteurized Donor Human Milk - How it works:</strong></h5><p>Dispensing safe pasteurized donor human milk is our highest priority. We take numerous steps to ensure all babies receive safe human milk that retains the many benefits of human milk. &nbsp;NorthernStar Mothers Milk Bank adheres to the strict guidelines set forth by HMBANA (<a href=""https://www.hmbana.org/"">Human Milk Banking Association of North America</a>). The pasteurization process can also be viewed in the video &ldquo;<a href=""https://youtu.be/m2y7hmPBF8Q"">Milk Journey</a>&rdquo;.</p><ol><li><strong>Potential donor moms contact the milk bank</strong> and are guided through a verbal multistep screening, which includes lifestyle and medical history.</li><li><strong>Donor moms&rsquo; health care providers complete forms</strong> that verify a donor is healthy and that excess breast milk would be appropriate for donation.</li><li><strong>Donor moms have a blood test</strong> to screen for infectious diseases.</li><li><strong>Donor human milk is processed</strong> in our lab, where staff are required to scrub in prior to working with the milk. Donor human milk is poured into flasks, filtered, homogenized, poured into bottles, visually inspected and then heat sealed and labelled. The label allows each bottle of milk to be traced forwards or backwards through each step in the milk tracking system.</li><li><strong>Donor human milk is pasteurized</strong> using the Holder method of pasteurization. The milk is heated to 62.5 C for 30 minutes. This pasteurization process kills bacteria, CMV and other viruses while still preserving immunological properties unique to human milk. The macronutrients are unchanged by pasteurization.</li><li><strong>Third party testing of a sample of milk</strong> from each donor before pasteurization and a bottle from each batch post-pasteurization is sent to a third party lab to ensure there are no harmful bacteria. Milk is only dispensed once a post-pasteurization culture shows no growth.</li><li><strong>Milk is then stored</strong> in our industrial freezers at -20 C and is dispensed by prescription to hospitals or babies in the community.</li></ol><h5><strong>Our Programs:</strong></h5><p><strong>Breastfeeding Basics Classes:</strong> Monthly free prenatal breastfeeding class intended to give parents the tools to navigate the first few weeks with their newborn. Skills and strategies such as breastfeeding positions, proper latch, feeding frequency, when and where to get help, troubleshooting and common concerns, are all areas that our lactation consultant (IBCLC) will address.</p><p><strong>Lactation Consultant Services:&nbsp;</strong>Members of our staff are certified lactation consultants (IBCLC) who are readily available to answer any questions or concerns our donors have regarding breastfeeding their babies.</p><p><strong>Bereavement Donation Program:&nbsp;</strong>Some of our mothers who donate milk are going through a very difficult time as they were not&nbsp;able to bring their precious baby home with them. After a loss, milk production still continues and mothers have choices on how to manage their supply. Donating their breastmilk after the loss of their baby is an option that we provide. Donating milk often gives purpose to bereaved mothers&nbsp;knowing that their milk is helping other babies,&nbsp;and&nbsp;creating a&nbsp;legacy for a lost child can be a step in the healing process.</p><p><em>For more information on our programs, please contact us at 403-475-6455 or email&nbsp;<a href=""mailto:contact@nothernstarmilkbank.ca?subject=Volunteering%20with%20NorthernStar%20Milk%20Bank"">contact@nothernstarmilkbank.ca</a>.</em></p>"	"public://profiles/Give us a hand (CKC1).png"	""	"Give us a Hand"	"<p>We rely on the generosity of individuals and corporations in order to continue our life-saving program. Financial assistance as well as volunteers are an integral part of our success in helping sick and fragile babies.</p><h5><a href=""http://www.northernstarmilkbank.ca/give-donate/give-financially/""><strong>Financial Support</strong></a></h5><p>As a non-profit organization, <strong>we do not receive any government funding</strong>. We operate on a cost recovery basis. Hospitals pay a dispensation fee which includes the cost of screening, pasteurizing and testing the milk. &nbsp;This does not include any costs incurred by our <a href=""http://www.northernstarmilkbank.ca/give-donate/charitable-care/"">Charitable Care Program </a>(see below), organization growth, equipment replacement, staffing needs outside of laboratory services, breastfeeding classes and materials, advertising and awareness campaigns. We must raise a minimum of <strong>$150,000</strong>&nbsp;annually to cover these additional operating costs.</p><h5>We have&nbsp;<em>five top priorities for funding:</em></h5><h5><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong><a href=""http://www.northernstarmilkbank.ca/give-donate/charitable-care/"">Charitable Care Program </a>- $60,000</strong></h5><p>Once babies leave the hospital, the cost of human donor milk is no longer covered by the hospital. Although the recipient might still be sick and still require donor human milk, the families are then left to cover the dispensing cost. In these cases, charitable care is available. This fund, which is generated solely from individual, family and corporate donors, ensures families have access to donor human milk for their baby. 100% of funds raised for charitable care are used to cover the cost of milk for families in need.&nbsp;</p><h5><strong>2. &nbsp; &nbsp; A New&nbsp;</strong><strong>Pasteurizer - $40,000</strong></h5><p>As the milk bank grows, so does the need for updated equipment. Our pasteurizer currently allows us to process&nbsp;143 bottles of donor human milk per day. A new pasteurizer would allow us to double our production and fulfill larger orders in less time.</p><h5><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Ice maker - $5,000</strong></h5><p>We currently receive daily deliveries of ice that is required for the pasteurization process. Having an ice machine on hand would help streamline the pasteurization process, make ice accessible and readily available and reduce transportation costs.</p><h5><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Walk-in-Freezer - $70,000</strong></h5><p>One of our largest challenges is storage. We are only able to pasteurize as much milk as our freezers will hold. Currently, we have milk stored at three different locations across Calgary that requires us to move, transfer and transport milk on a weekly basis. We will be installing a walk-in freezer in our new location that will permit us to have all of our donations and a larger amount of pasteurized milk on hand. &nbsp;</p><h5><strong>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Transition to New Location - $200,000</strong></h5><p>NorthernStar Mothers Milk Bank has seen a large amount of growth over the past four years. Our current facility limits the amount of milk that we are able to pasteurize and provide. We are expecting our growth to continue as the awareness of milk donation increases; therefore, in 2017 we will be transitioning to a new location. This will allow us to pasteurize a larger amount of milk, fulfill large orders, receive and dispense more milk and be prepared for emergency orders. The primary costs associated with this transition include: building a clean laboratory (plumbing and electrical fittings and installation), custom installation of a large walk-in freezer, moving costs, materials and furniture, as well as updating technology.</p><h5><a href=""http://www.northernstarmilkbank.ca/get-involved/volunteer/"">Volunteer Opportunities</a></h5><p>We are thankful for the generous donation of our volunteers&rsquo; time. Volunteers allow us to keep our milk costs as low as possible, as well as keep our day-to-day operations running smoothly. Our volunteers are involved in numerous activities, including:</p><ul><li>Pasteurization of donor milk</li><li>Logging in donor milk</li><li>Administrative work</li></ul><p>We also look for individuals who would be interested in joining our <a href=""http://www.northernstarmilkbank.ca/get-involved/ambassador/""><strong>Ambassador Program</strong></a>.

"478"	"Old Trout Puppet Workshop"	"17"	"<p>The Old Trout Puppet Workshop was founded back in the blustery winter of 1999 on a ranch in southern Alberta. We were a small gang of old buddies, with a fondness for beards and wood and wool and other old-fashioned and pleasant things; the world was uneasy with the threat of Y2K, and we felt an urge to huddle together for mutual protection, and to dedicate ourselves to something fragile, ridiculous, and gentle, out on the edge of the world. So we learned to carve puppets, and paid our rent through wholesome labour; we collected eggs, fed the pigs, cooked big stews, and premiered our first show to a bunkhouse full of cowboys and Hutterites.</p><p>Since those distant and savage days, the Old Trouts have grown to become a semi-respected collective of artists: we&#39;ve made puppet shows for both children and adults that tour the world, written and illustrated several books, crafted immense sculptures, taught eager young apprentices the secrets of their mystical art, and even made some award-winning films.</p><p>We are first and foremost a collaborative enterprise, devoted to the advancement of puppetry as an art form that combines a variety of other art forms: acting, dance, sculpture, painting, music, and writing. Our passion springs from a core of founding members, who endeavour to develop a way of making art that is strengthened by the varied backgrounds and interests of its members; in turn, those varied backgrounds are shared, with a view to the long-term development of our collective understanding of the art of puppetry.</p><p>We seek out new collaborations with each project, to discover new territories, and expand the artistic scope of those involved.</p><p>Above all, we are dedicated to original creation: We interpret the world around us, the stories and histories and events that constitute our environment, and bring them into focus through the lens of our own idiosyncrasies and enthusiasms so that the end result is art that is immediate and unique.</p><p>-----&nbsp;</p><p class=""blueTip"">Where the name comes from:</p><p>On the Palmer Ranch, where the Old Trouts first gathered, there&#39;s a swimming hole much beloved by the people of the area.

Our company is named after that noble creature, even though truth be told we never did manage to find it. &quot;Old Trout&quot; is also a term of endearment in Newfoundland, and that gave the name an endearing ring; of course, when we named ourselves thusly we were not yet old, but every day we become more and more like our moniker.</p><p>- See more at&nbsp;<strong><a href=""http://www.theoldtrouts.org/about.html#sthash.0rU3SCfW.dpuf"">ABOUT The Old Trouts</a></strong></p>"	"public://org_profile/How the Spirit Entered Me gallery_1.jpg"	"How the Spirit Entered Me - scene from Famous Puppet Death Scenes"	"How the Spirit Entered Me - scene from Famous Puppet Death Scenes"	"<ul><li>We promote and present puppet theatre, sculpture, and conventional theatre and to provide education in these areas.</li><li>We facilitate collaborative production of puppet shows, sculpture, theatre and related art.</li><li>We provide a facility that encourages varied and eclectic artistic endeavors.</li></ul><p><strong>Calgary&#39;s Outstanding Artists for 2016: &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>(March 16, 2016 - Calgary AB) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>The Mayor&#39;s Lunch for Arts Champions, organized by Calgary Arts Development and the Office of the Mayor, was sold-out for the fourth year in a row.

"559"	"Oldman Watershed Council"	"17"	"<p>We are a stakeholder based organization. We represent everyone who lives, works, and plays in the Oldman watershed - a diverse land and water system, covering 23,000km in southwestern Alberta and 2100 km in Montana. Socially, we are also diverse. Urban and rural, Indigenous and new Canadian, technology and tradition: together, we make common decisions about our drinking water for the benefit of the economy, our environment, the prosperity of generations to come.&nbsp;</p><p>Our citizens are hungry for unbiased, credible information, and we have established ourselves as an information hub for all stakeholders and communities. Under the provincial government&#39;s &#39;Water for Life Strategy&#39;, the OWC is one of 11 Watershed Planning and Advisory Councils in Alberta. We are mandated to provide advice, independent science, and big picture thinking to the Minister of Environment and Parks on the challenges that Alberta is currently facing. As such, we are an autonomous non-profit and we rely on the input, participation and financial support from engaged donors.</p><p>Our keystone publication is the &#39;Integrated Watershed Management Plan&#39;, published in 2011, which sets out our 8 goals. It is a collaborative effort between sectors, stakeholders, First Nations and the public to create the watershed community&#39;s plan. Since its publication, we have successfully tackled 2 of the 8 goals.</p><p>The first was to improve the understanding and strengthen the commitment of residents to the health of the Oldman watershed. We now reach well over 15,000 people on a weekly basis through social media alone, and it also attracting donors. For example, our Oldman emblem made its first appearance in May 2015 as a gift from the City of Lethbridge on a billboard at the entrance to the city. It also features on 3 interactive display puzzle boards. Each element of the emblem tells a story that helps educate participants about where their water comes from, where it goes, and what happens in between. Significantly, we have embarked on an ambitious Film Project, which involves one core film and many shorter videos highlighting many specific watershed topics. A critical part of the project has been involving people in the project; bringing new partners into the OWC family, giving a voice to residents and demonstrating how to inspire a community into collective action. In June 2015, the film project trailer was completed and continues to be at the heart of our outreach work.&nbsp;</p><p>The next goal we tackled was Goal 3 which is to manage and protect the integrity of headwaters and source waters. Based on the work of 2 behavior change specialists, 2 Outreach Assistants piloted our &#39;Engaging Recreationists Project&#39; in the summer of 2015. Its success attracted funding from the provincial government and others, so that we were able to continue with 4 Outreach Assistants, and a full-time Education Manager the following year. We have engaged representatives from various off-roading organizations and retailers to form a &#39;Recreation Advisory Committee&#39;. They ensure our programming is effective and help engage recreationists with our message about watershed health. This program also includes riparian restoration events, which attracts volunteers from all user groups.&nbsp;</p><p>The third goal is: Identify water quality outcomes and assess factors impacting them for adaptive watershed management. This goal, and the remaining 5 goals will be tackled in turn as we move forward in time. Significantly, aspects of each goal will remain firmly entrenched within our ongoing operations.</p><p>The Oldman Watershed Council exists to ensure clean, clear drinking water for generations to come. A healthy watershed is land-use practices that respect basic ecological thresholds - what happens on the land affects the water; and&nbsp;safe water supply, habitat for wildlife and plants.&nbsp;</p><p>The Rocky Mountains feed the headwaters of the Oldman mainstream and its tributaries (Crowsnest and Castle rivers, Willow and Pincher creeks), while the headwaters of the Belly, Waterton and St. Mary rivers rise in Montana. The watershed varies greatly, both in terms of the status of the land and water resources and impacts from human activities. In headwater sub-basins, water quantity is adequate, quality is fair to good, and riparian ecosystems are generally healthy. However, as the Oldman River flows east, water quality deteriorates, available water supplies diminish, and there are several issues of concern.</p><p>Whether citizens are urban or rural, enjoy motorized or non-motorized recreation; whether new Canadians or indigenous - it will take everyone to make significant change. In a natural resource-based economy, the economy IS the environment. Our impact extends beyond southern Alberta to positively influence other watershed professionals across Canada, government at all levels, and citizens of every community. We are all downstream!</p>"	"public://org_profile/OWC-Logo_Web-Snip_Aug.PNG"	"Oldman Watershed Council"	"How the Oldman River got its name."	"<p>The Oldman Watershed Council is the only organization where individuals, companies, organizations and communities can come together to devise practical solutions to the challenges our watershed faces everyday. &nbsp;We believe that the best, long-lasting solutions come from the people who live, work and play here. Our vision is a healthy, resilient watershed where people, wildlife and habitat thrive. We maintain and improve the watershed by:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Improving and sharing knowledge</li><li>Building and strengthening partnerships</li><li>Promoting and facilitating community and institutional action and stewardship</li><li>Developing and implementing integrated land and water plans</li></ul><p>Our current projects (2016-17) include making recommendations to the Government of Alberta, communications and outreach via a series of videos which are free for the public to use, growing The Hub (our multi-disciplinary office space, which we use to host free educational events with other green businesses and not-for-profits), providing technical expertise and funding for on the ground projects, instilling a stewardship ethic in backcountry users, and numerous community partnerships. As the OWC moves through its 8 Goals (arrived at through a multi-stakeholder consultation process), our current projects will grow and change.</p><p>The OWC improves the watershed by sharing knowledge;&nbsp;building and strengthening stakeholder partnerships;&nbsp;developing integrated land and water plans; and&nbsp;facilitating community and institutional action with independent research and projects.</p><h3><strong>Eight Priority Goals for the Plan&nbsp;</strong></h3><p id=""yui_3_17_2_1_1470785010272_625"">In December 2011, the Oldman Watershed Council released Priorities for the Oldman Watershed: Promoting action to maintain and improve our watershed after consultation with the IWMP Core Team, watershed residents at 4 community information sessions and an on-line questionnaire. The priorities were endorsed by the Oldman Watershed Council Board of Directors and will be the guide for what issues the IWMP will address.</p><p><strong>8 priority GOALS (Oldman Integrated Watershed Management Plan) are:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>GOAL 1:&nbsp;</strong>Improve the understanding and strengthen the commitment of residents to the health of the Oldman watershed.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>GOAL 2:&nbsp;</strong>Optimize the availability of water for the natural ecosystem while supporting the social and economic needs of the community.</li><li><strong>GOAL 3:&nbsp;</strong>Manage and protect the integrity of headwaters and source waters.</li><li><strong>GOAL 4:&nbsp;</strong>Identify and prioritize thresholds to manage threats and impacts on terrestrial and aquatic habitat.</li><li><strong>GOAL 5:&nbsp;</strong>Understand groundwater and how it interacts with surface water.</li><li><strong>GOAL 6:&nbsp;</strong>Identify water quality outcomes and assess factors impacting them for adaptive watershed management.</li><li><strong>GOAL 7:&nbsp;</strong>Prevent and control invasive species.</li><li><strong>GOAL 8:&nbsp;</strong>Understand the status and implications of emerging contaminants.</li></ul><p>These are the goals that the IWMP will achieve over the next decade. Public and stakeholder engagement processes foster deeper understanding and commitment to the maintenance and improvement of watershed integrity, and determine concrete action strategies through the development of Action Plans. Action plans for each goal will include specific targets, actions, and recommendations to decision-makers to achieve desired outcomes.</p><p>The Council consists of members who live or work within the Oldman Basin.&nbsp;These members provide leadership and guidance in watershed planning and management, water quality monitoring, and stewardship promotion. The OWC is governed by a Board of Directors who are comprised of fifteen representatives from various organizations and four members at large. The OWC was formed in September 2004, when the Oldman River Basin Water Quality Initiative (Initiative) merged with the Oldman Basin Advisory Council (BAC). When the Province&#39;s&nbsp;<a href=""http://waterforlife.alberta.ca/"" id=""yui_3_17_2_1_1470771311523_667"" target=""_blank"">Water for Life</a>&nbsp;strategy was released, these two groups combined to provide a diverse partnership knowledgeable in all areas of watershed management, including sustainable water management and land use practices in the Oldman Basin.</p><p>Today, the Council provides leadership and guidance in watershed planning and management, monitoring water quality and promoting stewardship. The OWC has not only carried on the work of the Initiative and the BAC, but also acts as the Oldman Watershed Planning and Advisory Council as part of the Water for Life Strategy.</p><p><strong>The OWC is a voice for the watershed. </strong></p><p>We strive to ensure clean, clear, plentiful water for generations to come. That means making everyday changes in communities throughout Alberta today.</p>"	"public://org_profile/29021822086_7f6f081543_k.jpg"	"Engaging Users in the Headwaters"	"Engaging Users in the Headwaters"	"<h3>1. Communications and Outreach Highlights</h3><ul><li>The OWC is into its second year of expanding staff to include a full-time Communications Specialist and the investment is paying off. We have grown our audience and attracted many new volunteers and donors by increasing our communications and by using more effective strategies.</li><li>Our social media channels are powerful tools for us. We now easily reach at least 15,000 people every week. &nbsp;The strength of our social media means that related organizations depend on us.</li><li>We have developed an extremely robust, interactive website which provides opportunities for education, information and collaboration. It has been recognized by experts in the field as an outstanding example of website design, and is updated on a continuous basis. It includes a blog to which guest contributors regularily submit.&nbsp;</li><li>The new Oldman emblem is a versitile and powerful new branding tool. It forms the core of all our communications, including interactive displays, merchandise and instantly recognizable everywhere it is seen.</li><li>Volunteers and interns help us achieve results. Reaching out to the community is part of implementing systemmic change and recruitment, training and retention has steadily increased.</li><li>Our digital archive is complete and used by organizations across Canada. Photos are added on an ongoing basis and comprises a visual, historical record of the OWC&#39;s outreach work and helps us tell empowering stories about the people working hard to maintain and improve the watershed. They are free and thus accessed by many organizations, including government, for other communications work.&nbsp;</li><li>Events bring people together and we have a continuous line-up of speaking engagements, regular meet-up groups, Lunch and Learns, and on the ground involvement in numerous community efforts to repair, restore and educate the public about where our water comes from, where it goes and their role in keeping it healthy.</li><li>One of the most exciting communications and outreach projects that the OWC has embarked on is an ambitious film project. Not only are we producing a documentary, but we are also, at the same time, producing an number of spin-off videos about specific topics (such as municipal watershed managment or agriculture, just as examples). These videos are scripted in collaboration with community partners, who donate to the project and help tell the story of water use in the Oldman basin and beyond.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>2. Watershed Legacy Program</h3><ul><li>Southern Alberta is characterized by ranching, farming and some of the most pristine recreational areas in the world. This program provides landowners and watershed stewardship groups support to design, fund and execute projects that have a positive and tangible impact on our watershed.</li><li>Past projects have included: off-stream watering sites, streambank stabilization, invasive weed removal, nutrient management, riparian fencing, wetland restoration, education and technical support.</li><li>&#39;Holding the Reins&#39; is an annual event that welcomes nearly 200 participants from throughout the watershed and beyond to hear about the projects and to share these stories with the broader community. Students from Lethbridge College and their instructors are also active attendees.&nbsp;</li><li>Applications are accepted once a year and selected on the basis of merit by a committee comprised of sector representatives with expertise in rural issues. Funding for this program comes from sponsors and donors who want to make a lasting contribution to the caretakers of the land who improve the integrity of our landscapes and foster awareness in present and future generations.</li></ul><h3>3. Engaging Recreationists Program</h3><ul><li>By far the most diverse program, this project builds on the Headwaters Action Plan to include the development of an education and outreach program to address the cumulative effects threatening the headwaters. This involves supporting a stewardship ethic in motorized recreation users, and encouraging these users to adopt practices that reduce sediment in streams. 2015 was the pilot season for this project which began building relationships with off-highway vehicle users an backcountry campers on public land.</li><li>The program is guided by the expertise of behaviour change specialists and utilizes effective, targeted programs and messaging, surveys and interviews.&nbsp;</li><li>Riparian restoration events at selected sites in the watershed are a popular way of involving volunteers and experts from other organizations (such as: Cows and Fish, Trout Unlimited Canada, Spray Lake Saw Mills, Crowsnest Pass Quad Squad and others). Bridge decking and construction is a tangible way of both involving OHV users and making a clear statement protecting water quality for both habitat and uses downstream.</li><li>The above groups, along with many others, have formed the Recreation Advisory Committee (RAC) which plays an important role in helping the OWC understand the perspectives of the stakeholder groups and thus affect more meaning, more immediate and more long-lasting change. They provide on the ground -- knowledge and expertise to ensure that education programs and government - led plans are effective at minimizing the impact of motorized recreation.</li><li>In order to manage this program, including 4 seasonal Outreach Assistants and a cadre of volunteers, the OWC hired a full-time Education Program Manager in 2015.&nbsp;</li><li>We continue to leverage the community, partner, and volunteer support and depend on the commitment from multiple stakeholder groups including represenatives from industry, governmnet, agriculture, recreation, NGOs and non-profit organizations. Significantly, this project depends on project funders who are committed to protecting our headwaters and ensuring water quality downstream.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>4. The Hub</h3><ul><li>The OWC moved our office to downtown Lethbridge in Janurary 2016. We chose a space that maximizes opportunities to engage watershed residents and build partnerships - the Hub for environment information and action.&nbsp;</li><li>Since then, we have hosted many events, also in conjunction with Environment Lethbridge, who rents space from us. The large community space at the heart of our premises is offered for free for educational events and we are looking forward to developing stronger relationships with the community to truly make the space a hub for activity underscoring watershed health.</li><li>Donors and sponsors are welcome to support either one off events or, for example, a series of Lunch and Learns.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>5. Committees and Community Partnerships</h3><ul><li>The OWC works with many committees, boards, and affiliated groups on common goals. Some of these include: Agriums Caring for our Watersheds Program which engages grade 7-12 students; Taber Irrigation District Integrated Watershed Management Project which constructs wetlands, riparian enhancements and canal improvements; City of Lethbridge Environment and Historic Resources Strategy Community Liason Group - dealing with the relationship between development and the environment; Porcupine Hills Coalition providing recommendations related to the linear footprint Management Plan and the Recreation Management Plans coming out of the South Saskatchewan Regional Plan; Lethbridge Chamber of Commerce Natural Resources and Environment Committee - highlighting the connection between food and water and overall watershed health; Round Table on Crown of the Continent - &nbsp;collaboration on projects and multi-organizational events to promote conservations and stewardship activities in the crown; Watershed Planning and Advisory Councils of Alberta - we meet regularily to learn from each other share resources, explore sustainable funding sources and maintain a strong provincial voice with the Government of Alberta; South Saskatchewan Intra-Basin Water Coordination Committee - provides advise to the Government of Alberta on managing water and how best to share water between the prairie provinces; Watershed Resiliency and Restoration Program - provides advise and recommendations to the GOA in alignment with the capital Agriculture Watershed Enhancement Program; Alberta Water Council - providing input to project teams on a wide range of topics; Kainai Ecological Protection Agency - offering support, advise and participation in events.</li><li>These are just some of the committees and community partnerships the OWC is actively involved in. Funding for this important and ongoing work is critical in order to ensure that water remains always top of mind.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"	"public://profiles/21682489659_13e378ff03_z.jpg"	"Successful OWC Lunch and Learn!"

I tripped off an elliptical machine and canned myself. Nice. Over, the next few weeks, I noticed some swelling in my &#39;gentleman&#39;s area&#39; and thought that I kind of deserved it, so I ended up ignoring and making excuse after excuse for not doing anything. Eventually I decided to talk to my mother about my balls (super awkward) and she insisted I see a doctor. What they ended up finding&hellip; was cancer. Getting canned saved my life but&hellip; I was terrified.</em></p><p><em>This marked the beginning of my nine and half year journey with testicular cancer.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>What I didn&#39;t know at the time was that testicular was the #1 cancer for men aged 15-35, and is often referred to as the &#39;young man&#39;s cancer&#39;. In every cancer seminar I went to, I was always the youngest patient by 30 or 40 years. I felt alone. In this isolation I struggled with thoughts like &#39;will any woman ever love me&#39;, &#39;will I ever have kids&#39;, &#39;am I going to survive this&#39;. I was diagnosed a second time four and a half years later at age 23, and the feelings of isolation and fear of these questions only got worse. For 7 years, I told almost no one about my cancer.

In 2016 a Oneball funded research paper was published in the prestigious Journal of Clinical Oncology which found that CT scans are no longer needed for testicular cancer patients two years after undergoing chemo-therapy. This means 3 years less exposure to radiation from the CT Scans (which can themselves cause cancer) and getting peace of mind for patients and their families 3 years earlier.

Right now,&nbsp;a patient undergoing chemotherapy and radiation can be forced to pay over $6,000 for medications not covered by our health care system.&nbsp;In addition to these medications, the surgeries associated with testicular cancer can put a patient out of work for some time.

"837"	"Operation Eyesight"	"17"	"<p><strong>Giving up isn&rsquo;t an option. Our patients don&rsquo;t give up, so neither do we.</strong> We&rsquo;re here for high needs patients who need our help ― like 10-year-old Simon. &ldquo;When I lost my right eye, I kept going. But when the other eye became infected I thought I would go blind! I thought my family would reject me like I was a cursed child,&rdquo; says young Simon from Kenya.</p><p>Simon injured his right eye as a young child and lost his vision in that eye. But when he contracted trachoma in his left eye ― a blinding and excruciating infectious eye disease ― his world turned dark and bleak. &ldquo;My dreams were shattered and my parents couldn&rsquo;t help me anymore,&rdquo; said Simon.</p><p>From a young age, Simon told his parents that his dream job was to become a tour guide like the ones that drove him home on their way to the Maasai Mara ― a large game reserve in Narok County, Kenya. His determination never faltered as he worked toward his goal.</p><p>But his dreams were threatened as the trachoma increasingly turned worse and his eyelashes scraped his eyeball causing excruciating pain. His parents tried every traditional medicine available to them, including a folk remedy of putting tobacco in his eye to cure it. Nothing helped and his father took him to help care for the livestock.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Fortunately for Simon, Operation Eyesight&rsquo;s kind-hearted donors understand the needs of so many people in poverty-stricken countries. It&rsquo;s through the support from people in Canada, that Simon received sight-restoring surgery to save his left eye.</p><p>Back in school after his surgery, Simon&rsquo;s teacher is impressed with how well he&rsquo;s doing. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s so eager to catch up with the rest of the class that he sometimes forgets he only has one eye. I&rsquo;m so happy with his progress,&rdquo; says his teacher.</p><p>Since his surgery, Simon&rsquo;s dream has changed and he wants to become a doctor to help save others. &ldquo;Now that I&rsquo;m back in school, I want to become a doctor so I can help my family like the doctors helped me.&rdquo;</p><p>Simon didn&rsquo;t give up and instead shows us what courage is and how much work we still have to do. And thanks to our wonderful donors we&rsquo;re making strides.</p><p>Our motto is to provide the &lsquo;best for the poorest&rsquo;, and we&rsquo;ve been doing that since our founding in 1963 by Calgary businessman Arthur (Art) Jenkyns. After meeting physician Dr. Ben Gullison who worked at a mission hospital in Sompeta, India, Art knew he had to help those in need, and founded Operation Eyesight in Calgary.</p><p>What followed was a partnership between Albertans and Indian eye doctors to train local professionals with the skills they needed to bring quality eye care to their communities.</p><p>Throughout the 1960s, success was measured through quantity, and Operation Eyesight was funding screening eye camps, training and cataract surgeries with a goal of reducing the backlog of patients needing surgeries. By the early 1980s, we were funding prevention programs focused on dealing with the root causes of blindness in addition to blinding eye conditions.</p><p>But research in the late 1990s showed that trying to perform as many cataract surgeries as possible resulted in high surgical failure rates. Worse, our focus on cataract surgeries meant we&rsquo;d neglected blinding eye diseases like glaucoma and trachoma.</p><p>Today we invest in sustainable treatment, prevention and community development working with a variety of partners including country health ministries, partner hospitals, other non-governmental organizations and community leaders.</p>"	"public://org_profile/Simon can now see to study.jpg"	""	""	"<p>Operation Eyesight is a Calgary, Canada-based international development organization dedicated to eliminating avoidable blindness in Africa and Asia.

Through our model, we help build the capabilities of our partner hospitals ─ from renovating existing structures to providing eye care training. Building our partners&rsquo; capabilities to deliver quality eye care services allows eye care professionals to educate communities on the importance of proper eye health.</p><p><strong>Community Health Workers: </strong>At the outset of any program, we target specific community needs. We conduct detailed assessments of our partner hospital service deliveries, infrastructure and staffing. Using strict criteria, we define target areas and then train community health workers (CHWs). Living and working in the community they serve, community health workers are a crucial component of our model. These trained workers conduct door-to-door screening, refer patients needing additional treatment and provide transportation where necessary. We&rsquo;ve found this to be the most efficient way of reaching high-need communities, raising awareness and breaking down barriers to eye health care.</p><p>Women make up 80 percent of our community health workers, and their active involvement also helps promote women&rsquo;s health and gender equality. Promoting gender equality and empowering women is important, yet many women face barriers to working.

We train existing hosital staff&nbsp; and all recurring expenses are absorbed by the hospitals. We also implement cost-recovery practices, meaning that funding for those who can&rsquo;t afford to pay comes from revenue earned from those who can afford to pay.</p><p>We reach a wide range of people, some in remote areas, and our strength comes from partnerships.

This motivated me to learn to use a walker and I checked out of The Fanning Centre and adopted a dog. This lovely miracle of a dog helped me learn to walk again, and I vowed to give back to PALS if I could.

We draw jointly from the strengths and guidance of Aboriginal teachings and traditions and from the most promising practices in human services to strengthen and help rebuild these relationships and connections. From these two influences, we offer services that are culturally appropriate and respectful of our clients&#39; own traditions and customs.</p><p><strong>1) MISKANAWAH CULTURAL RESOURCES:</strong></p><p><em>Miskanawah&nbsp;</em>(meaning &lsquo;pathways&rsquo; in Cree) is our philosophical framework that is rooted in Aboriginal teachings, ceremonies and guidance from Elders. These traditional values and beliefs have tremendous healing potential and are embedded within our service delivery practices. As its name implies, this approach assists individuals and families in building pathways to and within the community, strengthening their natural supports, and engaging in healthier ways of living.</p><p>We provide opportunities to take part in smudging, talking circles, sweat lodge ceremonies, drumming classes, a Round Dance and special ceremonies and celebrations to our clients, members of the community, and other groups like schools or businesses.</p><p><strong>2) YOUTH:</strong></p><p><strong><em>Aboriginal Mentoring Homes</em>&nbsp;</strong>| Aboriginal Mentoring Homes is a residential program where youth live with a mentor family until they return home or become adults. Mentor homes offer a safe and supportive place for youth to finish growing up and develop the strengths and skills needed for adult living.The focus is on building trust, mutual respect and making healthy lifestyle choices while supporting and strengthening cultural identity and connection. The age range is typically 12 to 18 years. This program operates with the guiding concept of&nbsp;<em>Oskipmatsahk</em>, a Cree word meaning &quot;youth transitioning to adulthood.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Regional After Hours Youth Support (RAYS)</em></strong>&nbsp;| The RAYS program provides safety and stability to children, youth and families in crisis situations through immediate response. RAYS workers support clients in the crisis situation but also reduce the long term negative impacts of crisis. RAYS staff might be called to support medical or mental health needs, accompany clients to clinics or the hospital, provide behaviour management support within a home, and supervise clients at risk of suicide or self-harm.</p><p><strong><em>Pathways Summer Camps</em></strong>&nbsp;| Pathways hosts summer cultural camps for youth ages 10 to 17 at no charge to participants. The camps focus on &lsquo;Quieting the Spirit&rsquo; of young people by exposing them to traditional teachings, songs, stories, and ceremonies within the natural, comforting surroundings of Mother Earth.</p><p><strong>3) FAMILY:</strong></p><p><strong><em>Healthy Families</em></strong>&nbsp;| Pathways&rsquo; Healthy Families program provides a home visitor for families with newborn babies. Visits focus on strengthening parenting, attachment, and child health and safety. Pathways helps families to monitor the developmental milestones of their child. Home visitors also support the physical and mental well-being of the parent(s).</p><p><strong><em>Nehiyaw Kihokewin</em></strong>&nbsp;| A Grandmother&rsquo;s Council (Kokum&rsquo;s Council) was called in order to develop our newest program, Nehiyaw Kihokewin.&nbsp; The name, Cree for &ldquo;families visiting with the spirit of our grandmothers,&rdquo; speaks to its development and its objective. Through this program, Aboriginal families with young children will be provided a home visitor that will support them in their child&rsquo;s critical early years of development. In addition to a strong parenting curriculum, families will have access to the support of Elders, ceremony, and traditional teachings passed down directly from our Grandmothers.</p><p><strong><em>Mahmawi-atoskiwin</em></strong>&nbsp;| Mahmawi-atoskiwin is a Cree word meaning &ldquo;a group of people coming together to work as one.&rdquo; Pathways has teamed with committed partners to work with Aboriginal families requiring Child and Family Service&rsquo;s support. The program is led by the voice and needs of each family as everyone works together to ensure children are raised in safe families.</p><p>&nbsp;For more information, visit&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.pathwayscsa.org"">our website</a>.</p>"	"public://profiles/beading & drumming classes.jpg"	""	""	"<p><strong>Support Vulnerable Youth</strong></p><ul><li>Become a mentor home and support a youth in developing healthy relationships and resiliency</li><li>Provide art supplies, sports equipment, punch passes for activities or movie passes to further programming activities for at-risk youth, helping develop feelings of self-worth</li><li>Help us reduce our costs by donating coupons for food or activities that youth participate in with their mentors and support workers</li><li>Volunteer to teach youth arts, music, sports or life skills</li></ul><p><strong>Create Strong Families</strong></p><ul><li>Donate baby items (such as diapers or clothes), toys or furniture to ease the stress of new families</li><li>$30 or a book of 10 transit tickets will give new parents transportation for 5 doctor&rsquo;s appointments</li><li>Give gift cards to help new parents provide for their children and meet their family&rsquo;s basic needs</li><li>Host a collection room to help us organize the donations for our programs and families</li><li>Volunteer as a family to mentor and offer friendship to a vulnerable family</li><li>$500 allows our Grandmother&rsquo;s council to facilitate a group learning experience, where they pass on traditional child rearing knowledge to new Aboriginal parents</li></ul><p><strong>Connect with Aboriginal Culture</strong></p><ul><li>$10,000 makes your business or employer a presenting sponsor of our Annual Honour Round Dance connecting almost 1,000 attendees with Cree/ Saulteaux traditions</li><li>Volunteer and help celebrate our Round Dance or Seasonal Celebrations, engaging with community members to dance around the drummers from east to west, the direction of the rising and setting sun</li><li>Participate in our drumming or beading classes, a pipe ceremony, a traditional sweat, a talking circle, or any of the other traditional practices we offer through our Miskanawah cultural resources programs</li><li>Invite an Aboriginal Cultural speaker to your team meeting</li></ul><p><strong>Strengthen Aboriginal Opportunity</strong></p><ul><li>$30,000 sponsors our Miskanawah Cultural Youth Camp for the season</li><li>$6,000 supports our Elder&rsquo;s Advisory council for one year</li><li>$750 will send one vulnerable Aboriginal youth to Miskanawah Cultural Youth Camp, connecting them to traditional ceremonies and increasing their understanding of cultural knowledge and self-identity</li><li>Join our Board and help serve an organization committed to Aboriginal cultural identity and integrity</li></ul>"	"public://org_profile/what you can do.jpg"	""	""	"ronni.abraham@pathwayscsa.org"	"www.facebook.com/pathwayscsa"	"twitter.com/PathwaysCSA‎"	"www.pathwayscsa.org"	\N	"841559610RR0001"	"403.257.5003"	"ronni.abraham@pathwayscsa.org"	"Ronni Abraham"	\N	"2304999"
"648"	"Potential Place Society"	"18"	"<p>Hello, my name is Izzy. I&#39;m a member of Potential Place, and I&#39;m here to tell you about my journey and to open a door of hope to young adults who struggle with mental illness. Mental illness is real. Instead of making mental illness a dark shadow, and having stigma attached to it - and all the fear that it creates in people to <em>not</em> reach out for help - we can create light and hope for people who are suffering. If we educate and create mental health awareness, people will no longer have to face mental illness in the dark or alone, scared and isolated.</p><p>I&#39;m currently 25 years old, I was adopted as a young child, I was born in Poland, and when polish social services apprehended me, I was found in deplorable conditions taken to an orphanage where I was adopted. I had suffered neglect and abuse in my early child hood years, which was damaging to my health development both physically and psychologically. I had inadequate nutrition for my brain development as well as inadequate caregiving for my emotional development.</p><p>My adoptive parents who were supposed to love me and protect me from harm, repeatedly abused me physically, sexually and emotionally - abused me for years up until I got to my later teen years. I ran away from home, ended up on the streets, homeless, living in shelters, and having to survive, I got into prostitution. I attempted suicide in grade 10.</p><p>I recently went through an extensive psychological assessment which resulted in diagnoses of PTSD, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, major depressive disorder, intellectual disability, learning disabilities, along with features of avoidant and dependent personality disorder. I also learned that my biological mom&rsquo;s alcoholism left me suffered with brain damage, and now going through the process of an FASD assessment.</p><p>When I first became aware of Potential Place &nbsp;I found it overwhelming; however, I continued attending despite the level of anxiety I felt. I needed people that understood what I was going through during this stage of my life, so I came up with an idea to start a young adult program so young adults can have a place where they connect with people their age, and get support building their goals and skills while steering them with the right resources and to help manage their mental health without judgement and shame. Young adults need support for their wellness - so they can engage themselves by going to school, or maintaining a job in the community to create meaning in their lives. They need to have a support network - so they can have the confidence to face their challenges and barriers - and so they can become independent and know that their voice matters, and it&#39;s ok to speak up and to reach out for help. Everyone needs that chance in life to have the opportunity to succeed, to grow and discover who they are as person and not just a diagnosis or a label.</p><p>Potential Place is a unique community and a place that has been my key support and I cannot imagine where I would be in life without Potential Place. It has been a place where I can work towards my educational goals, build relationships and feel part of something bigger then myself. Feeling like I am part of a community where people understand my strengths and weaknesses does make a big difference in my life. I don&#39;t have family support and a part of me will feel empty but I now see that family can be the people like the community of Potential Place, and the community of school, and friends and other supports I choose to have around me. I sometimes I feel vulnerable and scared to show my emotions but Potential Place hasn&#39;t judged me and I don&#39;t feel ashamed during my hardest times. I am accepted for who I am on my good and bad days. Potential Place community has been there for me when no one else has been there for me.&nbsp;</p>"	"public://org_profile/20141007_140655_0.jpg"	"Staff and members and Potential Place Reception Desk."

"<p>In a world of misunderstanding, Potential Place &nbsp;is a safe place that offers recovery through acceptance and opportunities to work side-by-side with professional staff in a structured work-ordered-day, one that is pre-vocational and which often-times, offers members opportunities for transitional, supported and independent employment in the community. Since 1995, Potential Place has been dedicated to building a community that cares for individuals suffering from mental illness. &nbsp;</p><p>Potential Place &nbsp;is a voluntary, caring community that offers a place of hope, dignity and growth. Like most Clubhouses world-wide, Potential Place is defined by values of acceptance, empowerment and egalitarianism.</p><p>Our Vision: Supporting recovery from mental illness in a community that Guarantees:</p><ul><li>A place to come</li><li>Meaningful work</li><li>Meaningful relationships</li><li>A place to return</li></ul>"	"public://org_profile/Dean and Linda touch the mountain.jpg"	"Potential people visit the Rocky Mountains."	"Potential Place is a caring community that offers a place of hope and growth."	"<p>The work-ordered day engages members and staff together, side-by-side, in the running of Potential Place.We focus on strengths, talents and abilities; therefore, the work-ordered day does not include medication clinics, day treatment or therapy programs.</p><p>The work done at Potential Place &nbsp;is exclusively the work generated by Potential Place in the operation and enhancement of the &nbsp;community. No work for outside individuals or agencies, whether for pay or not, is acceptable work at Potential Place. Members are not paid, nor are there any artificial reward systems.</p><p>Potential Place is open five days a week and parallels typical working hours.</p><p>Potential Place is organized into one or more work units, each of which has sufficient staff, members and meaningful work to sustain a full and engaging work-ordered day. Unit meetings are held to foster relationships as well as to organize and plan the work of the day.</p><p>All work at Potential Place is designed to help members regain self-worth, purpose and confidence; it is not intended to be job specific training.</p><p>Members have the opportunity to participate in all the work, including administration, research, enrollment and orientation, reach out, hiring, training and evaluation of staff, public relations, advocacy and evaluation of Potential Places effectiveness.</p><p><strong>Transitional Employment Program (TEP):</strong></p><p>Transitional Employment provides members with part-time, entry-level employment opportunities and the ongoing support they may need to stay on the job. We feel that Transitional Employment is not just about the tasks of the job, but also about maintaining a &ldquo;working&rdquo; ethic. We also provide assistance for Supported or Independent Employment opportunities, as we believe that this also provides members the self-confidence to eventually obtain permanent employment.</p><p>We have developed TE program-specific marketing materials. We have developed a Gantt chart to track activities by time line and have reflected colleague hours actually worked in each activity area. We have developed a member booklet that dedicates approximately 20 percent of its content to Employment. The ED, the employment coordinator and clubhouse members on the Board of Directors have engaged the Board to assist with TEP referrals. We have a system in place to train members and staff to do TE development and we have formalized procedures with respect to database management and cold call recording and methods for approaching prospective employers. Members and staff have been involved in the training process.</p><p>&ldquo;It is a new experience working with new people and developing new skills. It makes me feel like I contribute to a company and the community during the Calgary flood situation&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;Glen</p><p><strong>Young Adults Program (YAOP):</strong></p><p>The YAOP (Young Adult of Potential Place) program is a new and exciting initiative for Young Adults. This opportunity provides a peer to peer engagement between young adults who are transitioning from youth into adult programming. Work-Ordered-day responsibilities and social recreation activities are more age-appropriate.</p><p>We want Young Adults to participate in each unit where they feel like they can learn, and gain new experiences.</p><p>Mental illness usually first occurs in young adults. With appropriate resources and connections their mental illness can be managed in healthy ways.</p><p>A focus on all Young Adults will help build their goals, skills and empower them to discover their talents, in many areas including;</p><ul><li>Education</li><li>Employment</li><li>Wellness and Recovery</li><li>Social Recreation</li><li>Independence</li><li>Self Advocacy</li></ul><p>We believe Young Adults are highly energetic people who have much to offer our community. They are creative and artistic too!</p><p><strong>Education:</strong></p><p>Recognizing that supported education and employment are inseparable components along the career continuum, The member benefits because Potential Place attempts to help members develop the skills and confidence needed to succeed in accomplishing their goals within Calgary&rsquo;s educational community. Peers help tutor members in areas of Math, English and Computers. Potential students are also offered some mentoring and administrative guidance when required.</p><p>Many people affected by a mental illness are interested in work but may not have the educational background or self-confidence to pursue their employment goals immediately. Many have had disrupted educational opportunities during their formative years. These member benefits can be vital to their ability to acquire work beyond many entry-level positions.</p><p><strong>Social Recreation:</strong></p><p>At Potential Place, social recreation is an integral part of reintegration into the larger Calgary Community and it is a very important aspect in all Clubhouses. It contributes to the wellness of all colleagues. All activities are based on members&rsquo; wants and needs. Examples of some activities held within the Clubhouse are social &nbsp;Coffee Houses, Karaoke Nights, Dances, film nights, arts and crafts and game nights. Activities held outside Potential Place include walks for coffee, evening/day trips, picnics etc.</p><p>Social recreation activities begin, build and strengthen relationships at Potential Place. All Social time is planned for after work-ordered day hours. As most of our members are on low incomes, most outings that have a cost to them are shared between members and Potential Place.</p><p>Social recreation is offered on Fridays between 4:00 pm and 8:30 pm, as well as the first Saturday of every month from 11:00 am to 4:00 pm</p><p><strong>Wellness:</strong></p><p>&ldquo;<em>To keep the body in good health is a duty, otherwise we shall not be able to keep our mind strong and clear.</em>&rdquo; &nbsp;~Buddha</p><p>Poor preventive health care has created an epidemic among those with a mental illness. This trend results in a decrease in life expectancy of up to 20 years compared to the national average. Our wellness initiative at Potential Place is commitment to deal with these chronic issues.</p><p>Potential Place is committed to providing members the opportunity to address issues impacting their overall health. We have begun an initiative that focuses on assisting members with making healthier lifestyle choices that promote:</p><ul><li>Healthy eating strategies,</li><li>Healthy exercise strategies,</li><li>Decreasing overall weight.</li></ul><p>Our Bistro has decided to make healthier menu choices such as baked goods and nutritious meals vs. chocolate bars, water and juices vs. soft drinks and well-proportioned meals for $3. We have well-priced coffee and bottled water.&nbsp; Our members are directly involved in menu creation, running and managing the kitchen as well as the Bistro.</p><p>Each morning we start the day with stretching (ie: Yoga &amp; Tai-Chi). We have a wellness lunch twice a month to educate members on healthy eating and nutrition. Also, every Friday evening we get together and do something fun (Bowling, Billiards, and Movies etc) for our social wellness. Mental and physical health is fundamentally linked, so it&rsquo;s important to pay attention to both!</p>"	"public://profiles/Len_Stan_Kevin.JPG"	"Three people working together at Potential Place's central operations.

"<p>In 2014, a Social Return on Investment study was done by Success Markets Inc., and Charity Intelligence indicating an <strong>SROI of 7:1. </strong>According to the findings of this study, roughly 372 Alberta residents with mental illness would struggle to find or maintain employment, a sense of community and personal wellbeing each year without the intervention of Potential Place.</p><p>Their physical and mental health would suffer as a result, and the Alberta government would incur significant extra costs. This preliminary estimate was produced using conservative assumptions and shows that an average beneficiary of Potential Place appears to receive a best estimate of approximately $24,000 in lifetime benefits from things like employment, housing and decreased long-term medical expenses at a cost of around $7,000 per client. At the same time, greater society appears to save roughly an additional $24,000 per beneficiary in cost avoidance of public assistance, homelessness, and healthcare expenses.</p><p>Here are some ways you can be part of Potential Place and experience Clubhouse magic:</p><p><strong>DONATE:</strong></p><p>Join our&nbsp;<strong>Benefactors Circle</strong>&nbsp;with a donation of&nbsp;<strong>$100,000</strong>&nbsp;or more and you will receive:</p><ul><li>A Potential Place Program will bear your name</li><li>A Potential Place Gold Key, framed for you to proudly hang in your offices</li><li>Participation in a newsworthy victory awards presentation</li><li>A plaque at Potential Place recognizing your role</li><li>Our monthly newsletter</li><li>A charitable tax receipt for the full value of your contribution</li></ul><p>For participation of&nbsp;<strong>$50,000</strong>&nbsp;or more, you will be recognized as a&nbsp;<strong>Potential Place &nbsp;Patron</strong>&nbsp;with:</p><ul><li>A Potential Place Gold Key, framed for you to proudly hang in your offices</li><li>Participation in a newsworthy victory awards presentation</li><li>A plaque at Potential Place recognizing your role</li><li>Our monthly newsletter</li><li>A charitable receipt for the full value of your contribution</li></ul><p><strong>Friends of Potential Place,</strong>&nbsp;pledging&nbsp;<strong>$5,000</strong>&nbsp;or more receive:</p><ul><li>A position on a plaque at Potential Placee commemorating the role you played in establishing Potential Place.</li><li>Participation in a newsworthy victory awards presentation</li><li>Our monthly newsletter</li><li>A charitable tax receipt for the full value of your contribution</li></ul><p><strong>Host a 3rd Party fundraising event: </strong>We are always looking for new ways to fundraise.

"286"	"Project Ploughshares (Canadian Council of Churches)"	"18"	"<p>The year was 1991. Operation Desert Storm was the name of the invasion. Such value-laden yet ambiguous names these wars were given&hellip;Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Liberate Kuwait, Operation Friction (the Canadian name for Desert Storm). Names that might lead young men and women to think they were fighting for something good and pure&hellip;the &lsquo;just war&rsquo; theory come to life.</p><p>My nephew from Ohio was there in Iraq &ndash; a proud marine fighting for truth, justice and the American way.&nbsp; He was just 20, with a young wife and two little girls at home. Too young to be fighting wars. I remember watching the news night after night - wanting to see my nephew, to reach out to him through the screen. It was filled with video game images of a war being waged right before my eyes, against an entire nation of people&hellip;people like you and me&hellip;.people who loved their children and just wanted the best for them. This was a war that, seen on the television screen, looked impersonal, far-away, giving a fireworks-like impression that could make the viewer forget that there were real people being killed and wounded every day. I was often in tears, sitting cross-legged in front of the screen after I had put my babies to bed, not wanting them to see my grief and absolute rage at what was happening.</p><p>I developed a deep political sensibility during the Vietnam era. I was a senior in high school when four students were shot and killed by the National Guard at Kent State University. These were kids shooting other kids because of ideological differences, because of fear, because of listening to orders instead of thinking critically for themselves. This was the time when I began watching the news &ndash; seeing horrific images of Vietnamese villagers being bombed with napalm, seeing friends return from Vietnam with deep psychological, if not physical, wounds. I still remember well the iconic image of the young Vietnamese girl after being hit by napalm - an agent used in flamethrowers, bombs and tanks that sticks to the skin and causes severe burning. I struggled to see how this was in any way an effective or humane way to solve conflict.</p><p>As a result of my developing awareness of the horrors of war, I campaigned tirelessly as a young high school and university student against the insanity of this, or any, war. I pushed back against the system that promoted war as a means to resolve problems, felt frustration, sadness, anger at the shocking acts of violence I was seeing around me. I knew that there had to be an alternative to this insanity, to the inhumane ways in which humans treated one another&hellip;and I was quite keen on seeking out that alternative.</p><p>No longer wanting my heart to be broken with pain and grief, I made the decision to dedicate my life to working towards peace.

Project Ploughshares carries out its mandate by undertaking research, policy development, and public engagement to:</p><ul><li>Prohibit the use, possession, and manufacture of nuclear weapons;</li><li>Prevent the weaponization of space;</li><li>Control the supply and reduce the demand for weapons</li><li>Reduce the resort to military force; and</li><li>Build sustainable peace.</li></ul><p>A key task of Project Ploughshares is to encourage new ways of thinking about security in which the focus of security is the economic, political, and social welfare of people, rather than the military power of states. The research and analysis of Project Ploughshares is listened to and sought out by NGOs and government. The broad and engaged constituency of thousands of individuals, along with Canadian and international partnerships, contributes to a higher level of public debate and more comprehensive policy analysis.</p><p><strong>We believe: </strong></p><p>The most immediate threats to the security of vulnerable people derive from unmet economic and health needs, political exclusion, denied rights, social and political disintegration, and the criminal and political violence that accompany conditions of chronic insecurity. This means that security preparedness involved much more than military strength. A comprehensive approach to security required attention to and funding for the 5D&rsquo;s of security: development, democracy, disarmament, diplomacy and defence.</p><ol><li><strong>Development</strong> &mdash; end poverty and create economic conditions conducive to sustainable human security;</li><li><strong>Democracy</strong> &mdash; promote good governance, political inclusiveness, participation, and respect for human rights;</li><li><strong>Disarmament</strong> &mdash; prevent the transformation of political conflict into armed conflict by limiting weapons;</li><li><strong>Diplomacy</strong> &mdash; support the peaceful settlement of disputes and a rules-based international order;</li><li><strong>Defence</strong> &mdash; ensure that the use of force in extraordinary circumstance supports the full range of peace and security efforts (the other 4D&rsquo;s).</li></ol>"	"public://org_profile/2014 Floating Lantern Festival.jpg"	"Floating Lanterns at Olympic Plaza"	"2014 Floating Lantern Festival at Olympic Plaza – In remembrance of those impacted by the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  "	"<p>As a peace education group Project Ploughshares provides talks, workshops and written material to feed those who need feeding, &lsquo;food&rsquo; (information and programming) that comes from very high levels of peacemaking and academia in Canada and the rest of the world.</p><p>In the 33 years of its existence, Project Ploughshares Calgary has been sought out by people who wish to actually do something about issues such as the existence of nuclear weapons, the proliferation of arms sales around the world, bullying in schools and particular conflicts happening in the world such as the Iraq invasions, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sierra Leone and Syria. PPC has provided an outlet for action to Calgarians who are concerned. PPC also works with emerging as well as ongoing interests that involve peace-building within our community. We brought together 57 community, ethnic, faith and other groups to create the Calgary Community Peace Pole and Plaza. Further opportunities for engagement annually occur at our Peace Fair where some 30 environment, social justice and peace groups gather to sell their goods and at the Peace Remembrance Day service at the Peace Pole.</p><p>We have a number of upcoming programs that we expect will make an impact on the community in terms of learning more about peacebuilding.</p><p>1. &nbsp;<strong>Youth Focus</strong> - We currently have a particular focus on youth, for as Gandhi said, &ldquo;<em>If we</em> <em>are to</em> <em>reach real peace in the world</em>&hellip;<em>we</em> <em>shall have to begin with the children.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp; We take this seriously and as a result have held many programs during the past couple of years that focus exclusively on youth.&nbsp; These have included programs on Peaceful Parenting, Cooperative Games, The Internet and Cyberbullying, and Youth Restorative Justice.&nbsp; We have also presented sessions entitled &lsquo;What IS Peace Education?&rsquo; at the Calgary Teachers&rsquo; Convention, and at an Interfaith Conference and the Faculty of Social Work &ndash; the latter both at the University of Calgary.&nbsp; We have also done sessions on Fair Trade and Stereotyping &amp; Discrimination at the Diversity and Student for Change annual conference at Bob Edward Junior High.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Peacing It Together: Calgary Youth Speak Up</em></strong></p><p>Our annual Spring Workshop, to be held at the end of April 2015, is called <strong><em>Peacing It Together:&nbsp; Calgary Youth Speak Up.&nbsp; </em></strong>The focus will be on engaging youth in developing and initiating peace-related projects in their communities.&nbsp; We hope to have 25 young people come and experience the power of Image Theatre, which will be facilitated by an expert in this field, with the afternoon featuring a youth panel talking about their own views of social justice and peace, what that means to them, and how they feel they can work effectively in their own communities.&nbsp; The last session will be small group sessions, where creativity and imagination will be encouraged in developing plans to work for peace and justice in the Calgary community.</p><p><strong><em>Peace Studies Course</em></strong></p><p>Project Ploughshares, working with the Calgary Board of Education, is working on developing a course in <strong>Peace Studies</strong> for Grade Eleven Social Studies students.&nbsp; Our initiative fills an important gap within the high school social studies curriculum in the area of peacebuilding, and will incorporate modules dealing with youth in war, radicalization of youth, human security, cultural diversity, and youth restorative justice. These are indicative of current critical issues that have a great deal of relevance for youth today. The goal is that students make a personal connection to what they are learning in the classroom and develop critical and creative thinking skills which enable them to become peacebuilding-oriented when faced with conflict.</p><p>As the largest peace education organization in Canada, Project Ploughshares is uniquely placed to create a Locally Developed Course (LDC) for Alberta high schools on competencies in violent conflict prevention, conflict resolution, and the principles of peacebuilding, and awareness of modern-day causes of radicalization and conflict. This course will support students in becoming engaged thinkers and ethical citizens, as outlined by Alberta Education. Additionally, it is directly aligned with Project Ploughshare&rsquo;s mission and strategic plan in the promotion and development of peace education.</p><p>Our LDC will be first introduced as a CBe-Learn online course which is open to all CBE students.&nbsp; This course has the potential to reach thousands of Alberta senior high school students.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>2. &nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Floating Lantern Festival: Remembering Hiroshima, Creating Peace</em></strong></p><p>Held annually for the past 3 years at Olympic Plaza, this is a commemorative event, open to the public, in memory of those whose lives were lost or irreparably damaged by the atomic bomb attacks on Hiroshima August 6 and Nagasaki August 9 in 1945, and also of all human life lost or destroyed by warfare.&nbsp; 2015 marks the 70th anniversary of these bombings. Oral presentations and music will be followed by audience participation in the placement of floating lanterns on the surface of the water.&nbsp; The event will begin about 5 PM with a mini-festival including food and water but no alcoholic beverages.&nbsp; The festival will include activities for children (including yoga and a storytelling tent), music, drama and speakers. Last year&rsquo;s event was attended by over 500 people; we would like to make that number even bigger this year in order to raise awareness and educate more people about the dangers of nuclear weapons.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>3. &nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Annual Toy Audit</em></strong></p><p>October 2015 will be our third year of doing an audit of Calgary toy stores.&nbsp; Volunteers visited 12 Calgary toy stores, examining the shelves for violent and non-violent toys and games, books and videos.&nbsp; We looked for games and toys that encourage the use of weapons (historical and modern) for solving conflicts;&nbsp; we looked for how the message was communicated on packaging; we checked the location of toys and games on shelves and in displays; and we&nbsp; checked to see if video sections were following the Alberta ranking and age appropriate rules.&nbsp; One of the main outcomes of this project is raising awareness of the prevalence of violent messages and violent solutions that are given to our children, and promoting that there are healthier and more sustainable alternatives.</p><p>Results of the audit are sent out to all Calgary media during November.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>4. &nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Annual Ploughshares Peace Fair</em></strong></p><p>November 2015 will be the 31st annual fair for Project Ploughshares Calgary.&nbsp; This fair sells goods from some 30 organizations who work in the fields of social justice, fair trade, and the environment.&nbsp; It is always very well attended by Calgarians, and serves to bring awareness of issues of peace and justice to the greater community.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>5. &nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Remembrance Day Ceremony</em></strong></p><p>Each year on Remembrance Day, Project Ploughshares holds a small ceremony at the Calgary Community Peace Pole to remember all lives lost in war.&nbsp; This past year&rsquo;s ceremony was called</p><p>Respecting Past Sacrifices, Looking to the Future, and focused on not only remembering the past, but the need to learn from it and create a peaceful world.&nbsp;</p><p>The following programs need financial support - for amounts required, see details in our WHAT YOU CAN DO section:</p><ul><li>Spring Workshop &ndash; <strong><em>Peacing It Together:</em>&nbsp; Calgary Youth Speak Up</strong> &ndash; April 25, 2015</li><li><strong>Floating Lantern Festival:&nbsp; Remembering Hiroshima, Creating Peace</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; August 6, 2015</li><li><strong>Peace Studies Course Development</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; July 2015 &ndash; June 2016.&nbsp;</li></ul>"	"public://profiles/DSCN9161_2.jpg"	""	"Cooperative Games Night – the children are very attentive!"

I called<br />our family doctor who filled me in with information about what to expect with<br />my father and also suggested that I start regular psa testing. I soon started<br />getting regular dre&#39;s and psa tests. My father went on to hormonal therapy and<br />lived another 4 years, ultimately dying of a heart attack.</p><p>During this period every time I went for a test I heard &quot;everything&#39;s<br />normal&quot;. When I was 55, my psa came back at 3.6 and I was sent to an<br />urologist. Again, &quot;everything&#39;s normal - come back next year.&quot; The<br />following year my psa climbed to 5.6 and a subsequent biopsy gave me a Gleason<br />score of 6, and six positive core samples out of 6 taken. I had prostate<br />cancer!</p><p>My urologist told me that surgery was my best option, but because of the extent of<br />the cancer and the good possibility of it having spread outside the capsule, he<br />would have to be aggressive in his surgery. He assured me I would most likely<br />be impotent, and possibly suffer from incontinence. Radiation was also<br />mentioned as a secondary treatment if the surgery failed. Needless to say I was<br />in shock! I was 56 and I had thought, healthy. My routine for over 8 years was<br />to swim a mile a day, watch what I eat and drink and not smoke. I had no<br />symptoms and felt great. But suddenly I felt like my life was over.</p><p>After getting over the initial shock I decided to be equally aggressive in my search<br />for treatment options. I went first to the library. Remember, this was almost<br />six years ago. The books I found were not very helpful. Most dealt with surgery<br />&ndash; the operation, recovery, living with side effects, etc. While I was doing<br />research I sent copies of my biopsy slides to Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital<br />in New York for a second opinion. I also sought out and had an appointment with<br />another urologist in another city. The internet provided me with links to other<br />treatments, to survivors, and prostate cancer specialists. To make a long story<br />short I finally linked up with Dr. Haakon Ragde in Seattle, Washington. His<br />recommendation was three-fold. A 4 month course of hormones (Zoladex and Flutamide),<br />25 sessions of external beam radiation and finally brachytherapy &ndash; the<br />insertion of tiny radioactive seeds directly into the prostate gland under<br />ultrasound guidance.</p><p>I went with his recommendations. The hormonal therapy and external beam radiation<br />was provided by the caring staff at Tom Baker Cancer Centre in Calgary. As<br />brachy was not yet available in Canada I had that procedure done in Seattle. I<br />finished my treatment in December, 1997.</p><p>Now over seven years out and my psa is stable at 0.1. My quality of life is<br />excellent. Knowing what I know now, would I do it again? Absolutely. But I also<br />recognize that my choice of treatment, while right for me, is not necessarily<br />right for others.</p><p>Since my diagnosis I have become very active in the prostate cancer support community. I took over as President of PCCN Calgary (the local support group) four years ago, and in January 2003, became President of the Prostate Cancer Canada Network.</p><p>Prostate Cancer support groups fulfill an important role. They are there when the newly<br />diagnosed need someone to talk to right now! They can also provide up-to-date<br />information on various treatment modalities. Many groups regularly feature<br />medical guest speakers at monthly meetings to keep members informed. Building<br />awareness for early detection and advocating for treatment options are also<br />important functions of the groups.</p><p>PCCN Calgary&#39;s mission statement says it all: &quot;Our objective is to assist and<br />support patients, families and friends as they deal with prostate cancer. We<br />inform, empathize and reassure men on their journey. We share our experiences<br />with our own cancer, lift our spirits and strengthen our resolve to fight for<br />quality of life and a cure.&quot;</p><p>PCCN is the national organization representing some 120 independent support groups<br />across the country. PCCN speaks for tens of thousands of men suffering from<br />prostate cancer to government and business. PCCN builds awareness through<br />projects like &quot;Living Proof&quot; &ndash; a national awareness campaign<br />featuring prostate cancer survivors and a soon to be released national<br />television campaign featuring Red Green.</p><p>What can be done to help in the battle with prostate cancer? If you&#39;re a man over 50<br />or over 40 with a family history of cancer, talk to your doctor about getting<br />tested. Watch your diet and exercise regularly. If you have already been<br />diagnosed, get in touch with your local support group.

He was 61 years old and in good health and was diligent about getting his annual physical which included both the digital and PSA tests. His PSA was elevated which led to the biopsy confirming cancer. He elected to have the Radical Prostatectomy and has fully recovered.</em></p><p><em>In 2009, I decided to join the Calgary Ride for Dad in support of prostate cancer research and education and dedicated my participation to my brother and his success in the battle with prostate cancer. He attributes the success to early detection through annual checkups. Little did I know that in less than two months I would also be diagnosed with the disease, also at age 61.</em></p><p><em>I had been getting annual physicals from age thirty and prostate checks became a part of the routine in my mid forties. I am fortunate that my current family doctor is very thorough when it comes to medical examinations. When I mentioned my brother&rsquo;s diagnosis, he sent me off to the Calgary Prostate Cancer Centre when he noticed an abnormality in the digital exam. The subsequent biopsy confirmed cancer and after considering the options, I opted for the surgery. I&rsquo;m happy to report that everything went well and I&rsquo;m pretty much back to normal.&nbsp;</em><em>I can&rsquo;t say enough about the Calgary Prostate Cancer Centre and the great work they do with prostate cancer research and education.</em></p><p><em>During my pre-op visits I guess I was too preoccupied to notice the Resource Centre and the wealth of information that was available. It was only later that I decided to attend an evening session that involved short presentations from professionals that spoke about healthy diets, physical fitness, yoga programs and pelvic floor rehabilitation. My recovery was certainly enhanced by putting to practice some of the information received at this wellness clinic.</em></p><p><em>I was impressed by the dedication of the staff and volunteers at the Prostate Cancer Centre and in 2010 I signed up with the Man Van&trade;</em>&nbsp;<em>as a driver.

First, the realization their child may not be developing typically; then, seemingly endless doctors&rsquo; appointments, medical tests and assessments . . . and more doctor&rsquo;s appointments. Often, there remains a lot of questions and very few answers, and uncertainty about the future for their precious child and for their family as a whole.</p><p>Parents tell us stories of harsh judgement by strangers in grocery stores and playgrounds and a shrinking pool of friends as their child is excluded from birthday parties and backyard barbeques. We know parents who have taken their child to 11 doctor&rsquo;s appointments in two weeks; parents whose child is 5 and hasn&rsquo;t slept more than two hours at a time; a child who has been turned away from 17 childcare facilities because they cannot handle his behaviour; and moms who have chosen to end their professional careers to care full-time for their child.</p><p>The stress can be hard on family relationships, and it&rsquo;s often difficult to know where to turn or what to do next for your child.

Needless to say, soon afterward Philip received his first lesson about nuns and Catholicism.</em></p><p><em>It was through Martha&rsquo;s work at Providence Creche that she met Father Patrick O&rsquo;Byrne.

Married 12 years ago in India, I was left behind to raise two young sons when my husband immigrated to Canada. Finally when I joined him 5 years later with my children, my life turned upside down. With the stress of settling in a new country and the financial difficulties, his alcohol binges increased, and the occasional casual slaps escalated to violent beatings.</p><p>I covered the bruises or avoided being seen. At first it was only me, but then also my older son. I didn&rsquo;t speak English, knew few people, and felt as though there was nowhere to turn. I didn&rsquo;t know the ways or systems here, and they don&rsquo;t understand my culture. What was I to do?</p><p>I could not go back. My mother always said &ldquo;<em>from now on your husband&rsquo;s home is your heaven or hell, you have to live there</em>&rdquo;. One night his anger was so fierce, I ended up in hospital. The police asked if I wished to press charges. But what would I do then, who would support me? What would my family say? How would we manage &ndash; with my sons in school, and no income and no one to turn to ? W<em>hat do I do, where do I go?</em></p><p>Then a lady at the hospital connected me with PCHS.&nbsp; The PCHS worker came to see me at the hospital, and soon my life started getting better. I&nbsp; felt connected, understood, supported and stronger.</p><p>The case worker was Punjabi and I could speak openly in my language! She helped arrange counselling for me, my husband and my sons. I made friends at the Womens Support group, and my husband said he enjoyed and learnt so much at the Parenting classes, even about anger management! He said he was not as stressed since taking the financial literacy course, and I am happy he is attending the AA meetings. I now feel I have many friends and my children will have a good life in Canada &hellip;&quot;</p><p><strong>A Father&#39;s Story:&nbsp;</strong>&quot;I didn&rsquo;t understand why Child Services knocked at our door, or what allowed them to walk through our home and take our daughter away, or declare us &ldquo;unfit&rdquo; parents.</p><p>We are hard working parents and have been in Canada for 10 years. We want to give our children a good life! I work two jobs and my wife works one job. Sometimes we are both not home in the evenings, when the children come home from school. Then our older son who is 15 years old looks after his younger sister, that is the culture, as the older brother he protects and looks after his little sister. And then, government officers took our daughter away. They said she complained to her friends and the school teacher that her brother hits her and was mean to her. That is her brother, why would he do that? They tell us our son said that he hated looking after her.</p><p>They say that we will need to meet with a case worker and an investigation will be launched. How will I get the time off from my work? I may lose my daughter ? Where did we go wrong, what did we not understand, how do we get our daughter back?</p><p>That is when we approached PCHS, and they helped us understand the Canadian laws, and worked with Child Services to help get our daughter back home. We have been attending the Punjabi Parenting classes, and have learned new skills to support our children, to teach them to be resilient and strong, to succeed in Canada. Our son now also volunteers with PCHS. We are thankful we have been able to keep our family together.&quot;</p><p><strong>Twilight Tears:&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;I am 78 years old, I live with my son in Canada, as a widower, I am very lonely. My grandchildren only speak English which I do not understand, my son and daughter in law are at work all day and in the evenings they have very little time for me. I cannot visit my friends or go to the senior centre as my knees are bad and I cannot walk so far to the bus stop. If I complain, they tell me&nbsp;<em>&rsquo;what more do you want, we called you here didn&rsquo;t we</em>.&rsquo;</p><p>However since my children and grandchildren have begun attending the PCHS parenting class my life feels better. My grandchildren ask me to teach them Punjabi, then sometimes even ask about India and what it was like for me growing up.. Although they don&#39;t understand all I say, I like very much that they are trying to learn Punjabi, and someday ...&quot;</p><p>At PCHS we help support our clients in their own language and within our common cultural context; we teach families skills and tools to strengthen relationships and succeed in Canada.

To that end we are always looking for new ways to nurture young people through exceptional adventures in theatre. So when we found out that 53% of residents at the emergency shelter with Inn from the Cold were children, we were eager to get involved.</p><p class=""p1"">We reached out to their team and together determined that providing a free performance of our Christmas Stories show to these children and their families would make the biggest impact.</p><p class=""p1"">Although space in the shelters is limited, the Inn from the Cold team was incredible and determined to find us a place to perform. Meanwhile our&nbsp;team dreamed up imaginative ways to adapt the show to meet the needs of this special performance. &nbsp;</p><p class=""p1"">As word began to spread to the shelter community, excitement was quickly growing.</p><p class=""p1"">The night of the performance was very cold and snowy. We were thrilled as we watched excited children pouring in with their families. The kids were ecstatic to be there and jumped around with glee as the show began. &nbsp;Their enthusiasm was infectious as they sang along and shared their thoughts aloud throughout the performance. The little ones were so eager to be apart of the adventure that they would storm the stage whenever we asked for an audience member to help. We could see the joy the children felt reflected on many of their parents&rsquo; faces as they smiled, able to forget for a moment where they were.&nbsp;</p><p class=""p1"">From my seat, I overheard one little one say to his mom:</p><p class=""p1"">&ldquo;This is the best Christmas ever!&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p class=""p1"">I could hardly hold back my tears. &nbsp;</p><p class=""p1"">This little guy was living in a shelter. &nbsp;</p><p class=""p1"">But it was true. We were warm inside, singing Christmas carols,&nbsp;drinking hot chocolate and sucking on candy canes.&nbsp;After the show, the performers were flooded with kids looking for hugs, and a chance to further explore the set and puppets. &nbsp;The space was full to bursting with Christmas cheer and happy faces.</p><p class=""p1"">Moments like these are what Quest Theater is all about.</p><p>&quot;How lovely to think that no one need wait a moment.

Our mandate is to serve as a catalyst for creative communication, co-operation, and change. Quest Theatre develops and produces theatrical experiences that are relevant and important to young people. The Quest experience enhances ones sense of self, engages individuals with issues in their communities, and fosters ongoing connections to the performing arts.</p><p class=""p2"">Quest&rsquo;s legacy goes beyond our performances and programs.

Young people gain insight on the performing arts as a means to describe, interpret, evaluate, judge, connect and understand ideas and issues in life. Awareness of the emotional impact of artistic experiences is also revealed through the Quest experience. The value of the arts is underscored by meeting and working with professional artists, and is affirmed by curiosity about, and intent to explore, the performing arts and similar experiences further.</li><li class=""p2""><strong>Growth and Financial Integrity:</strong> Quest Theatre works continuously to ensure that we are fiscally responsible, and deliver on our Stakeholder agreements.

My drinking increased through high school. When I went to work in the oil patch at the age of 18, drinking and drug taking became a way of life. I was married at age 20 and my addictions began to have consequences; trouble with my wife, parents, friends and the law. To all of this I was oblivious. By the time I was 39 I had lost two wives and two sets of children, all of my friends, my home, my job, and I was bankrupt.</em></p><p><em>Facing life on the street, I reached out for help, but no matter what I did or what others did to help me, I could not stay clean and sober. After detoxing 11 times in 14 months I was referred to Recovery Acres. I cannot say enough about this program and what it did for me. The counselors helped me understand my alcoholism and addictions; they walked me through the 12 steps of AA, they taught me to live and stay clean and sober. While at Recovery Acres I learned what needed to be changed in me in order to go out into the world and become successful in every area of my life. I was also introduced to a spiritual understanding which was instrumental in my recovery.</em></p><p><em>While in Recovery Acres Residential Treatment Program I began studies that would prepare me for a change in career. When I completed the program I began a career as a Financial Advisor and now 24 years later I own a successful business which has given me a fantastic life, a beautiful home, travel and all the perks that one associates with success. I am also a competitive triathlete and Ironman which brings me great joy and happiness. None of this would have been possible without the help and support of Recovery Acres and their counselors. My relationship with Recovery Acres is ongoing and I still drop by once a week for lunch. Had I sat down on the first day in treatment and dreamed about how good life would be I would have never have imagined how things have turned out.</em></p><p><em>-----&nbsp;</em></p><p>Recovery Acres is a registered charity that operates a fully accredited addiction treatment center.

"Recovery Acres provides addiction treatment and practical tools that can save lives."	"<h3><strong>CARE (Co-occurring Addiction Recovery Essentials) for Women</strong></h3><p>On Sept. 12, 2016 Recovery Acres launched CARE for Women, an intensive, clinical outpatient program designed specifically for women with addictions that co-occur with mental health issues like anxiety, depression, trauma-related issues or other psychological challenges. The program was developed to fill a significant service gap in clinical care for women who are unable to enter into residential treatment due to caregiving or employment obligations. In-house child-minding is available for women with pre-school aged children.</p><p>CARE for Women provides psychological testing and assessment, therapy, 12-step recovery foundations, and relapse prevention. The program takes place in two phases over three months.</p><h4><strong>Phase l: Intensive Day Program (Two weeks</strong><strong>)</strong></h4><p>The core essentials of CARE&nbsp;are learned over the course of two weeks. Women attend 10 six-hour psychoeducational modules that provide the foundation for treatment and recovery. The Intensive Day Program includes:</p><ul><li>Psychometric-specific psychological testing and assessment</li><li>Detailed, prescribed treatment plan</li><li>Biopsychosocial-spiritual psychoeducational programming and support materials</li><li>Access to a Psychologist to review test results and treatment planning</li><li>Group therapy</li><li>Introduction to 12-step recovery foundations</li></ul><h4><strong>Phase ll: Relapse Prevention Program (10 Weeks)</strong></h4><p>Following completion of the Intensive Day Program, women begin Relapse Prevention (one weekday evening per week). Over ten weeks women will develop:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Relapse prevention planning skills</li><li>Healthy trigger response</li><li>Strategies for managing mental health</li><li>Self-discovery and accountability</li></ul><h3>1835 House Men&#39;s Treatment</h3><p>1835 House provides both Day and Residential Program options for men who are sincere about wanting to overcome addiction and/or alcoholism. Over the course of more than 40 years, 1835 House has refined a culture of sobriety built on the foundations of 12-Step recovery. The 1835 Recovery Model includes:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Total environment recovery</li><li>Counsellors in recovery (first-hand experience with an addiction)</li><li>Sobriety first</li><li>Total abstinance</li><li>Peer mentoring</li><li>Employment</li><li>Extended recovery</li><li>Planned Aftercare</li><li>Alumni Association</li></ul><p>Employment is a unique and vital part of the 1835 Recovery Model because it requires responsibility and dependability. It also provides daily challenges in which to practice newly learned coping skills, and builds self-esteem and confidence.<br />Employment provides structure and tasks in the crucial initial phases of recovery when replacing unhealthy behaviors with healthy ones can sometimes be about filling time appropriately. All clients spend their first two weeks in-program at our centre. At the beginning of a client&#39;s third week unemployed residents are required to begin a job search. Clients on leave from an employer are encouraged to return to work while continuing to live at the centre.&nbsp;</p><h4>Co-occurring Disorders Treatment Program</h4><p>We are committed to addressing both the addiction and mental health concerns of our clients. Men who are assessed with a co-occurring mental health disorders may choose to enter the Co-occurring Disorders Treatment Program and begin one on one psychological counselling. An introduction to co-occurring disorders is presented to all Residential Program clients.</p><h4>Referrals</h4><p>Clients are referred to 1835 House from corporations, hospitals, universities, the medical profession, Alberta Health Services, Calgary Drug Treatment Court and through self-referrals. Recovery Acres works within an extensive network of stakeholders, service agencies and government agencies including the Calgary Homeless Foundation, Alberta Health, Alberta Justice as well as Pathways to Housing (The Alex), Calgary and area hospitals, various corporations (EAP programs), AA Central and Renfrew Recovery Centre.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"	"public://profiles/CARE logo w Essentials.png"	""	""	"<p>When you give to Recovery Acres, you are giving a father or mother back to their children, a daughter or son back to their parents.

Health involves more than the absence&nbsp;of disease. Health can be divided into five primary areas: physical, social,&nbsp;psychological, spiritual and financial. If something is wrong in one of the&nbsp;primary areas it can impact another or possibly, other areas. To understand a client,&nbsp;one needs at least a basic knowledge of their situation in all areas. The best&nbsp;way to help a client is to understand their personal goals and dreams.</p><p>Everyone should be aware of their options and then be allowed to&nbsp;make an informed decision. We assist individuals and families by developing&nbsp;personally-centered case management plans, and then we work with our clients to&nbsp;achieve their identified planned goals. We connect individuals and families to&nbsp;government, private and community services that will be instrumental in&nbsp;achieving their goals.</p>"	"public://profiles/iStock_000022989347_Medium.jpg"	"Youth sleeping on the street"	"No child should be on the street"	"<p>James is a 22 year old male who had just graduated from AARC a youth addictions centre with no place to go. &nbsp;James had burned all his bridges with family and friends and the only friend willing to take him in was one who was still active in his own addiction.

She has never been away from home overnight before and it feels far too overwhelming meeting these other students from many different backgrounds and communities. She is really missing her family and wants to go home.&nbsp;Tasha finally decides to stay, but on the second day, a comment about land claims from someone upsets her because she felt it was a discriminatory statement about Indigenous people.</p><p>Tasha finds the courage to speak up even though she really just wants to leave and go home. On expressing her concern to Tim, the individual responsible for the statement, he immediately apologizes. Through their discussion, he explains what he had really meant to say and offers to apologize to the whole group for the unintentionally hurtful comment. Tasha agrees to stay one more day. &nbsp;After that group apology, Tasha is feeling heard and a little more confidant. During that day, there are two presenters that have an immediate impact on her. &nbsp;Alison shares ways to find and see the positive attributes that we each have and Tasha is surprised to hear from her group members about some of the strengths that they see in her. Later she hears Cory speak from the heart about living with a physical disability, Cerebral Palsy. The messages from these two sessions resonate and are a turning point for Tasha, who is so grateful that she stayed until the last day.&nbsp;</p><p>Tasha returns to her school with a new confidence and purpose. With her fellow students, she feels empowered to create a &ldquo;Be the Change&rdquo; project to teach others about Blackfoot culture. Connecting with neighbouring schools in Strathmore, they do their first tipi building workshop with Grade 3 students. That school is so thrilled with the impact on their students, they want Tasha and her group to return to do it again next year. Meanwhile the word spreads and another school asks them to do the same workshop with their Grade 4 students! &nbsp;Inspired by the experience, Tasha is an amazing example of a young person taking action in her community to create understanding and change.&nbsp;</p><p>This is only one story of hundreds from Alberta high school students, who are inspired to take action in their communities to create change. &nbsp;</p>"	"public://org_profile/Siksika Outreach Project 2017.jpg"	"Siksika Outreach ""Be the Change"" Project"	"""Be the Change"" Project"	"<p><strong>SEEDS Connections empowers youth to create positive change by p</strong><strong>roviding educational programs which engage Canadian students in experiential learning opportunities in the areas of diversity, environment, energy, and leadership.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Our programs have involved over <strong>40,000</strong> students, who have completed over <strong>50,000</strong> environmental and diversity projects, and impacted audiences of more than <strong>75,000</strong>, since 2011. &nbsp;</p><p>Locally and Canada wide, our communities are seeing increasing change in our natural environments and in the diversity of our populations.

When I first arrived in Calgary, I attended the funeral for my son&rsquo;s father. This man had arranged for my release while I was held captive by a gang, where I had suffered years of unspeakable abuse while locked in a camper. He managed to negotiate my freedom. His sudden death in a motorcycle accident was devastating, and my whole grieving process (and so much more) happened with my new sisters.</p><p>One of the most important things to me was knowing that nobody knew where I was, and that I was safe. In the classroom, there was so much that needed to come out so I could heal. Not just grief for my son&rsquo;s father, the remaining trauma from my experience with the gang, and all the pain that comes with years of addiction. There was also the very first monumental abuse that changed the trajectory of my life when I was 14 years old. That&rsquo;s when a 29 year old drug dealer confined me, sexually assaulted me, and coerced me into smoking crystal meth. That&rsquo;s how my life became about feeding an addiction.</p><p>To open up about all that with the girls and women in class was really hard. But I looked around and saw that I wasn&rsquo;t the only one that was exploited. I wasn&rsquo;t alone. I initially came to here because I was told they could help me get my son back after he was apprehended. I got that, and so much more. Sharing built a sisterhood between us. The love that comes from this community is unbelievable. I got my life back. They gave me my son back.</p><p>There are no words to explain the gratitude I have for this program. I am now 30 years old, and have two years of continuous sobriety.</p><p><em><strong>That is the Strength of Sisterhood.</strong></em></p>"	"public://org_profile/WHY Snippet Web HOME W-Shadows.JPG"	"We Stand Together"	"Together: The Strength of Sisterhood"	"<p>Our Participants are Mothers, Daughters, Sisters and Friends.

As Jean Claude Munyezamu knows from experience &ldquo;<em>on the soccer field it doesn&rsquo;t matter where you come from and, for a while, you can forget what you left behind.</em>&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Jean-Claude Munyezamu is a Rwandan Canadian who escaped the genocide in 1994 and volunteered in refugee camps in Somalia and Sudan before moving to Canada in 1998. When Jean-Claude moved to Calgary he continued to volunteer with places like The Mustard Seed so that he would meet people and continue to improve his English. Jean-Claude says that he feels that Calgary has adopted him and that he wants to do what he can to help others who are new to the city. He knows what it&rsquo;s like to have to leave your home and culture and everything that is familiar to you. When he saw children in his neighbourhood struggling to fit in and falling through the cracks he knew he had to do something.&nbsp;<em><a href=""http://www.soccerwithoutboundaries.org/our-founder/"" target=""_blank"">Read more about Jean-Claude.</a></em></p><p>In 2010, after attending a Glenbrook community meeting concerning youth crime, Jean Claude Munyezamu started a free grassroots soccer program for immigrant and low income children. Today, boys and girls of every age, skill level and culture participate every week in the program that now runs year-round, indoor and outdoor. Participants come from Syria, Afghanistan, Lebanon, Somalia, Sudan, Rwanda, Korea, China, The Philippines, Uruguay, Colombia, Congo and more. Many came to Canada as refugees. Some of the children who participated when the program began have returned as volunteer coaches. This leadership experience has helped some get their first job or move on to higher education.</p><p>Immigrant parents are being introduced to other families in their neighborhood, whom they can rely on for support and information pertaining to their new lives in Calgary. Furthermore, parents in the local soccer association, Calglen, have embraced these families into their club, offering rides, developing friendships on the soccer fields and sharing used equipment of their own. Older players have gained work experience as volunteer coaches, using this as a step towards an entry level job or higher education.&nbsp;</p><p>-----&nbsp;</p><p align=""left"">Like many Canadian urban centers, Calgary has seen tremendous growth as many immigrant and refugee families move to the city. With minimal language skills and hard working parents, the children and teens in this community need the support of a program like Soccer Without Boundaries (SWB) to facilitate their transition and provide a safe, athletic program to occupy their time.&nbsp;</p>"	"public://org_profile/JC Vista Heights.jpg"	"Jean-Claude Munyezamu poses with players from Vista Heights"	"Jean-Claude Munyezamu poses with players from Vista Heights"	"<p align=""left"">Our primary goal is to provide an outreach program that engages youth to participate in soccer as a means to integrate immigrant and low income children into their new community. Last summer SWB offered a free summer soccer program in a local greenspace. Nearly 100 children participated, representing 19 different countries and with ages ranging from pre-school to high school. This camp offered an affordable, safe environment for children with working parents but was not financially viable for a volunteer based organization.</p><ul><li align=""left"">Last summer, SWB sought to expand our programs and made plans to hold a Summer Camp in August (August 8-12, 2016).

This opportunity gave working parents, some from single parent families, an affordable and safe week of summer camp for their children.

It also provides their parents and families with a means to volunteer, meet their neighbours and get involved in their community.</p><p class=""p1"">If you were to ask Jean-Claude about SWB&#39;s accomplishments this year, this is his response:</p><ol><li class=""p1""><p>It was really good to see so many of the kids who were previous participants in our club and camps serving as small group leaders at our Summer Camp this year.

We dream of a community where women and children live safely in healthy families.&nbsp;</p><p>Sadly, shelter for women and children fleeing domestic violence is a <a href=""https://www.acws.ca/collaborate-document/2325/view"">deep need in our city</a>. Each year Sonshine Centre becomes home for approximately 40 families, the overwhelming majority of whom are considered at high risk for fatality or serious injury due to violence in the home. Would it surprise you to know that over half of residents in a women&#39;s shelter are children? Over the past three decades, Sonshine has seen the alarming impacts of domestic violence on children and its significant negative effects on a child&#39;s emotional, social and cognitive wellbeing. In fact, witnessing or experiencing domestic violence is the <a href=""http://www.unicef.org/protection/files/BehindClosedDoors.pdf"">number one indicator that a child will grow up</a> to be a victim or perpetrator of violence. Not only does Sonshine help end family violence right now, we place special emphasis on the children in our care in order to cut off the cycle of violence before it impacts future generations.</p><p>In many circumstances, the 21 days offered at women&rsquo;s or family emergency shelters is simply not enough time for a woman to gather the resources she needs to ensure she and her children can live safely and independently. <a href=""http://www.acws.ca/collaborate-document/2342/view"">Surveys by the Alberta Council of Women&#39;s Shelters</a> found women return to abusive partners because of poor economic circumstances and lack of housing. This is why Sonshine offers an 18 month program, to support women through the healing process and equip them with life skills and/or job-specific training in order to become financially stable and capable of maintaining appropriate housing. Most importantly, women leave Sonshine empowered to create safe, healthy, loving environments for themselves and their children.</p><p><strong>To learn more about how we make a difference, please click on this link: <a href=""http://www.sonshineservices.ca/successstories.html"">Our Success Stories</a>.</strong></p>"	"public://org_profile/6137118_xl.jpg"	""	""	"<p>Sonshine Community Services has been serving the local Calgary community since 1978 by providing care, support, housing and counselling to families and individuals in need.

What makes us clearly unique is that there is no other organization that reaches women and children in crisis at the ground level with the simple virtue of kindness. While many organizations support shelters with much needed funding these funds often times go unnoticed by the very demographic we are all striving to assist. Not only do our monthly donations of soup decreases the operating costs of the Shelters we support by 18-20% thereby allowing these funds to be put back into much needed programming and support services, it is important to note that the shelters often attest that our soups provide self-esteem to shelter residents at this time of crisis in their live where they believe that no one cares. The message that comes with the soup is hugely impactful and a testament to a caring community.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong><em>&ldquo;I have been working in the anti-violence sector for many years and the abuse often presents the same in that the women are told by their abusers that they are worth nothing. Soup Sisters is not just about the soup. It is more than caring, it is about saving lives when people start believing that they are worthy of life free of fear and that they are not dumb, stupid and ugly. So while Soup-makers pay, chop, cook and write, we hand the soup to the women and tell them someone paid to make this for you because they care about you &ndash; know that you have changed a life. &ldquo;</em></strong></li></ul><p><strong>NATIONAL RESULTS:</strong></p><p>According to the Canadian Institute of Health Research, almost 1.7 million households (13%) experienced some level of food insecurity.

They come to Stardale Aboriginal after school program through word of mouth from their community or a referral through a counselor, group home or the Justice system. Honouring the Girls&#39; Stories is a culturally sensitive, girl-focused empowerment programming for Aboriginal girls.</p><p>We are told that the girl is &ldquo;shy&rdquo;. She has trouble fitting in and is not doing well at school. And with her shyness she has difficulties making friends. As the girl has been moved around from school to school and to various community settings because of her family&#39;s situation, she tends to gravitate to girls who seem to be like her. They call themselves the misfits. Sometimes these girls gather together and harass, manipulate and physically hurt other girls. Then there are the other girls who come to Stardale who really are shy. They have difficulty speaking up in situations; find problem solving a challenge and mistrust authority figures.&nbsp;</p><p>Stardale&rsquo;s programming Model forms the girls group that everybody fits in, where everybody has a voice with something to contribute. The group and peer-mentoring format is used to maintain a balance of sources of positive influence for the girls as we find positive role-modelling and mentorship is often lacking in the girls&rsquo; personal lives.&nbsp; In turn the girls exhibit more compassion and tolerance when supporting each other in the group.</p><p>The positive changes in the girls are amazing to see! It is like watching a flower blossom open its petals gradually into a full bloom. The once shy or withdrawn girl is communicative and can be rather chatty. We often laugh and playfully tease stating &ldquo;<em>do you remember when Courtney, Shae, Brittany, or Laila started the program?</em>&rdquo; They are no longer withdrawn sulking or moody.</p><p>The girls are enthusiastic to learn and stick with the classes in self&ndash;esteem, communication, relationships, boundaries, family dynamics, cooking, acting, health and wellness, nutrition, violence, abuse, and physical activities. They are eager to learn more about the Aboriginal culture and values, as well as women&rsquo;s roles. Additionally, the girls are thrilled to volunteer in the community. They are proud to help where they can. It gives them a tremendous sense of self-worth!</p><p><strong><em>&ldquo;Fifteen-year-old Natasha said she&#39;s nervous about her first modelling gig, but says the program has helped boost her self-confidence.

For 18 years, we&#39;ve designed and tested the Stardale Model for the enlightenment of females as a multi&ndash;disciplinary approach to community development, culture, education, healing, social inclusion, prior learning, and social justice.</p><p>Stardale takes a two world view and includes Aboriginal literacy which is a learner&ndash;centred approach to lifelong learning that honours the interconnectedness of all aspects of creation for personal empowerment, community development and self&ndash;determination. Aboriginal literacy encompasses first languages, elder involvement, culture and community in a holistic developmental approach to unify mind, heart, body and spirit.</p><p><strong>Mandate of Stardale</strong>:</p><ol><li>Introduce proactive interventions that empower Aboriginal girls to overcome systematic barriers and internalisation of lower standards of wellness, achievement, education, and employability by providing classroom educational opportunities as well as skills-training and strategies for healthy choice-making.&nbsp;</li><li>Focus on preventative measures of addressing abuse and violence by following a holistic approach in training, thus allowing each participant to heal in her own time(s) and place(s).</li><li>Foster cross-cultural exchange of health and social development issues with community partnerships</li><li>Develop research and learning schemes in order to have a better informed view of the needs in the province.</li><li>Share our programming strategy, and encourage others to begin the healing journey</li></ol><p><strong>Program Activities embedded in the Stardale Model framework: </strong>Over the many years of service delivery, Stardale has initiated programming through group dynamics, whereby, the sharing has vastly similar experiences and realities.</p><ul><li>Incorporation of oral tradition &ndash; There was an abundance of art and stories, (contemporary and traditional)</li><li>Incorporation of Aboriginal cultural traditions &ndash; The cultural aspect combined with the therapeutic processes made way for evolving programs such as the Talking Quilt and Sacred Weft, which correlated the experiences of women who had experienced the impacts of Residential Schools. The Stardale Sacred Weft Collection has been featured in an exhibit at the Glenbow Museum First Peoples for the past four years.</li></ul><p><strong>Teaching Approach:</strong> &nbsp;Stardale&rsquo;s programming format is multi-dimensional, but for the period of 2005 to the present it may be best understood by grouping healing strategies under two the broad, non-exclusive headings: the artistic and the communal. Art is employed as a healing tool in the program framework by adapting the woman&rsquo;s sacred circles to work in harmony with the art, allowing an entire new dimension of [self-/ group- /ancestral-] awareness. It is a portal for the awakening of the young girls&rsquo; spirit. The art heals by freeing their creativity and expression, and resonating in their bodies, minds and spirits. When working within the group context, the healing becomes transpersonal. It connects one to another; it is an art of interconnection. The art may become ceremonial, environmental, performance or static. Whatever the art form is, the community becomes directly and indirectly involved. Stardale exploits the benefits of the support group and the mentorship relationship as educational tools, to enhance the girl&rsquo;s development and to overcome self &ndash;destructive behaviours.</p><p>For the past ten years in Calgary and area, Stardale has worked with over six hundred Aboriginal girls, who are at-risk for experiencing violence, sexual exploitation and other destructive behaviours in their lives.</p><p><strong>Benchmarks:</strong></p><ul><li>May 10, 2012 - Fashion Showcase in the lobby of the TransCanada building.

Such constructs have been the sexual exploitation of the girl/ child through the media, through the internet, through prostitution and more. We have identified and widened the scope to protect the vulnerable due to their age, poverty, and subjection.&nbsp; We have examined many of the activities that create, maintain or exploit the girl child. What does constitute a means of prevention and combats the sexual exploitation of the girl/child? The Stardale Women&rsquo;s Group has introduced social and cultural activities through a diversionary process which strengths resiliency and combats destructive behaviours. Stardale will continue to explore dynamic intersections of art and mentorship and to advocate for Aboriginal female youth by &ldquo;honouring our girls stories&rdquo;.</p><p><strong>Goal: </strong>To introduce an educational footprint for Aboriginal girls in Calgary and area that incorporates a preventative model of life skills and literacy that builds resiliency among the girls against exposure of destructive behaviours.</p><p>-----&nbsp;</p><p>The Stardale program is open to all Aboriginal girls aged 10-17 and targets those girls in particular who may be at-risk or at high-risk of destructive behaviour and/or whose families are financially vulnerable.&nbsp; The girls who come to Stardale are referred through various sources. I.E. school counsellors, teachers, social workers, agencies, and word of mouth. Also, we have referrals through visiting our website and word of mouth. All participants will be fully informed about the goals of the project. Girls will need to have consent given by a legal guardian, and this will be arranged before the program commencement. Stardale, in conjunction with each referral source, will facilitate the consent form completion process.</p><p>The culturally-sensitive girl-focused content of the program engages girls in the areas of health and wellness, self-confidence, conflict resolution, constructive communication, emotional awareness, and risk-factors for destructive decision-making. The program builds on many unique experiences. This includes: fashion modelling &ndash; especially - as a tool for imparting skill sets in etiquette, poise, public speaking, personal hygiene, body awareness, and confidence while challenging the participants to discover a new lens for perceiving and engaging with fashion media.&nbsp; Then there is the dimension of performance art, which opens group discussions to the depths of abuse, violence, traumatic incident, suicide prevention, etc. &nbsp;Physical well-being, body awareness, and coordination are further emphasized in the classes on dance, hoola hooping and running.</p><p>We offer classes in cooking at the Community kitchens facilities, which the girls truly enjoy! And then there are the out of door physical activities, from hiking at Edge worthy park and Johnson Canyon, snow shoeing in the Kananaskis, swimming at the North East Leisure Centre, horseback riding at Longview, and building camp fires for story telling sessions out in the bush.</p><p>Volunteering:&nbsp; Not only does Stardale have a variety of dedicated and loyal women who volunteer with the girls. It is the girls too who are encouraged to volunteer within the community. It is giving back to the community that they feel a deep sense of purpose. The girls have volunteered at the Red and While club for the Minister of Indigenous Affairs &ndash; Len Webber, RBC &ndash; Stampede BQ on the Eight Ave mall, Clearstream for the Cochrane Rodeo, etc. They really enjoy getting out into the public and demonstrating their self-confidence.&nbsp;</p><p>-----&nbsp;</p><p><strong>An Artistic Lens for advancing social change:</strong> It has been through the communication of creative innovation that Stardale continues to voice the needs of Aboriginal youth and the fostering of knowledge from what we learn in our processes of programming that we have developed and experienced.</p><ul><li>Committing - 2013 Aboriginal youth production on suicide awareness, tragedy and hope <a href=""https://vimeo.com/66316504&nbsp;"">https://vimeo.com/66316504&nbsp;</a> -Edmonton presentation of the production Committing&nbsp;</li><li>Alesha&#39;s Dream - 2014 Stardale&#39;s collaboration with Alberta Ballet production with a modern and traditional story line of Aboriginal girls interpretation of suicide&nbsp; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iw3RndSSBVQ"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iw3RndSSBVQ</a> - behind the scenes of the concept and collaboration of Alberta School of Ballet and Stardale&nbsp;</li><li>Committing Program: Honouring the Girls Stories 2015 another unique concept in a performance piece, based upon our knowledge acquired to date in outreaching to a broader spectrum of audiences in disseminating&nbsp; the story line of youth suicide and prevention</li></ul><p><strong>Antidotal information:</strong></p><ul><li><em>The Moms are much more involved in the program as well as supporting the girls in the program.

Back when I started this job, I only had a naive textbook understanding of what poverty was and what it looks like. I was excited to be starting a job that assisted the Greater Forest Lawn Area, because this is where I have lived all my life, but even that didn&rsquo;t prepare me for the reality that people and families endure while they are living in poverty.&nbsp;</p><p>Poverty in Calgary is real, despite our prosperity. Too many families have to choose between buying groceries or paying the rent.&nbsp; Too many individuals have to spend their time jumping through hoop after hoop to qualify for assistance that they are eligible for. And this is where Sunrise shines. As a Community Advocate, I am able to ensure that the basic needs of my clients are met, so they can stop worrying about how they will feed their children next, and focus on improving their skills instead. We help navigate the systems and advocate on behalf of people so disenfranchised that their voices are often ignored, or can go unnoticed.</p><p>The clients that we assist are some of the strongest, most resilient people I have ever met. Many of them inherited poverty and circumstances that make it very difficult to get ahead, because so much of their time and resources are stretched thin by just trying to get by to the next day, or the next meal. I&rsquo;ve met mothers living on $1000 a month total while balancing going to school to improve their English and raising their children within a new culture, but still preserving their own.&nbsp; They are dealt challenge after challenge, but still manage to keep going, and do so with a smile, sometimes through the tears.</p><p>I work with Sunrise, because I know there is a need in the communities, and because I know that the means are out there to meet them. I want to be a part of an agency that will make that happen.</p><p>-Natalie A., Community Advocate</p>"	"public://org_profile/Natalie.jpg"	"Natalie, Community Advocate at Sunrise"	"Natalie, Community Advocate at Sunrise"	"<p>Sunrise was created in response to community concerns about social problems in Calgary&#39;s east side. In 1997, the Marlborough Social Concerns Network, the Sunrise Community Partnership, and the Family Violence Prevention Initiative, with the encouragement of Calgary and Area Child and Family Services, formed a working committee to address these concerns. There was broad agreement that a centre was needed in east Calgary to provide information dissemination, referrals to services, and more accessible programming. In September 2000, Sunrise Community Link Resource Centre was established.&nbsp;</p><p>Sunrise Community Link exists to engage community members in creating their own successes - personally, socially, and financially. There are many opportunities and places to get help in Calgary, but often times, there is a gap between these opportunities and the people that need them the most. As a resource centre, it is Sunrise&rsquo;s role to address this gap through systems navigation assistance. For many clients, Sunrise is the first place to call when they want to address certain circumstances in their lives, but don&rsquo;t know where to start. Sunrise offers its expertise on resources, whether that be through the open hearts and minds of its Community Advocates or by sharing the tools needed, but are otherwise unknown to the community members. Our core values at Sunrise Community Link include integrity, empathy, respect &amp; dignity, proactive response, collaboration and honouring people.</p>"	"public://org_profile/Money Management.jpg"	"Money Management"	"Money Management"	"<p>Sunrise&rsquo;s programs are offered as a choice and an opportunity for inclusion, education, and personal growth. Offering choice is empowering, and so is offering growth and education. Taking charge of your own life is the key to success.&nbsp; Presenting programming in this way inspires individuals to take control of their own lives and engage in their own enrichment.</p><p>Many families and individuals struggle daily to makes ends meet financially, because of barriers to employment, such as not having access to childcare, or not knowing the language. There is an ongoing cycle of poverty that makes it very difficult to break out of once engulfed it. While focusing on surviving it is often difficult to see beyond this panicked state. Sunrise Community Link gives these individuals and families a chance to take a deep breath and let them know they are not alone. With this awareness and the proper tools their focus can be changed from just surviving to thriving. Sunrise does this by way of providing information, referrals and advocacy. Referrals to our partner agencies for such things as food, clothing, household items and furniture are done on a daily basis. This allows clients to access these basic needs without further financial burden. Sunrise also advocates for their families by creating relationships with other workers in the Social Service field. This might be Social workers at Alberta Works or Child and Family Services. It is when these agencies work together with their clients that most goals are met and clients&rsquo; needs are satisfied. Advocacy may also come in the form of mediating between a landlord and tenant regarding rental situations. Sometimes all it takes is a third perspective to accomplish something quickly that may have otherwise ended in an eviction and possibly homelessness.&nbsp; Advocacy comes in many forms. Empowering people to advocate for themselves is our ultimate goal.</p><p>Our Community Advocates at Sunrise have been trained to facilitate money management workshops.&nbsp; These workshops are offered as an opportunity to look at household budgets and find creative ways to save money, and redirect money to where it will be most beneficial.</p><p>To offer a weekly skill-building and socializing opportunity, Sunrise has endeavoured into the realm of social enterprise, by offering Kmitt Knitting Circles. The programs involves bringing socially isolated clients together with volunteers for weekly knitting circles with the goal of making mittens to raise awareness about poverty in Calgary. These mittens are sold using a &lsquo;one for one&rsquo; model, so for every pair of mittens sold through this initiative, another will be donated to someone currently experiencing poverty. Proceeds from sales will go to sustaining the program as well as reinforcing the operating costs of Sunrise Community Link.</p>"	"public://profiles/Kmitt.jpg"	"Kmitt Knitting Circles"	"Kmitt Knitting Circles"	\N	\N	\N	\N	"shaunap@sunriselink.org"	"www.facebook.com/SunriseCLRC"	\N	"www.sunriselink.org"	\N	"863566592RR0001"	"403.204.8280"	"shaunap@sunriselink.org"	"Shauna Parks"	\N	"306719"

However,&nbsp;they recognize that often we adults can find it quite taxing to invent enough of them. To counter this,&nbsp;the Suzuki Talent Education Society engages older students to mentor the younger ones. Noah was Alexander&rsquo;s mentor.&nbsp;They first met at weekly group classes for the five to eight-year-olds. As mentor and student-teacher,&nbsp;Noah would come to all the classes. With his imagination, Noah could relate to the kids in ways that adults could not&mdash;we would never have dreamed up the image of holding violins in a way to catch scoops of ice cream falling from the sky. Alexander adored Noah as a student teacher.</p><p align=""left"">At age six, Alexander was going through a patch of finding violin especially frustrating. His teacher, Wan-Tsai Chen, hit upon a brilliant idea: what about asking Noah if he would give Alexander weekly mentoring sessions. Most junior high kids would not embrace that, but Noah has grown up in the community of beautiful hearts that make up&nbsp;Suzuki Talent Education Society. He seized the chance to show Alexander the fun of making music. Noah has created innumerable games to mix music and fun for Alexander. Noah would often greet Alexander with a new creation, like cardboard Ninja stars with musical activities written on them, or giant homemade dice. Alexander&rsquo;s eyes shine every time we head to Noah&rsquo;s house for a lesson.</p><p align=""left"">Noah is showing Alexander the joy of music. What is an even rarer gift is that Noah is a model of what a kid can do to make the world a better place through generousity. Others at the&nbsp;Suzuki Talent Education Society&nbsp;radiate that spirit, too, so I am not surprised when our kids are excited to play at seniors&rsquo; homes, or dream up the idea of busking to raise money for victims of Calgary&rsquo;s great flood of 2013.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p align=""left"">Alexander proudly raised a lot of money for UNICEF at his last birthday party.

Foundation"	"21"	"<p><strong>Robert&#39;s Story: &nbsp;</strong>Robert was a complex man, who faced many complex problems in his life.</p><p>At the age of eight, following years of physical, mental and emotional trauma, Robert became a ward of the foster care system. At the age of 16, Robert left the foster care system and became involved with street life. During these years, Robert struggled with drug and alcohol addictions and was in constant conflict with the criminal justice system.</p><p>Later in life, Robert faced even more challenges when he was diagnosed with bipolar and borderline personality disorder, as well as HIV.&nbsp; His complex health needs continued to add additional challenges in his daily life, ultimately hindering his ability to live the life he wanted and deserved.&nbsp; Years of financial instability, substance abuse, and participation in the sex work industry, while continuing to deal with his complex health needs, marginalized Robert in his community. Ultimately, Robert became withdrawn and distrustful of community workers and social institutions. Although Robert had been referred to several specialists, addiction counselors and life skills programs, he was often refused treatment based on prior criminal convictions and anti-social behaviour.</p><p>Because Robert did not have the opportunity to acquire conventional life skills as a youth, he often struggled to maintain his living space, his personal finances and even cooking for himself. Robert and his caseworkers recognized that his general well-being and quality of life would improve if the proper support systems could be accessed and utilized. &nbsp;</p><p>In January of 2009, Robert became a resident in one of SHARP Foundation&rsquo;s programs, giving him access to supportive resources that could assist him in areas of his life that were challenging to address on his own. Robert enjoyed the stability the SHARP program offered him; however, it soon became evident that Robert would benefit more from a program that was able to offer him higher levels of individual support and care.</p><p>Robert was transferred to the more intensive, long-term care program offered by SHARP called &ldquo;Beswick House&rdquo;. Beswick House was able to help Robert stabilize his medication regime, while addressing his addictions and mental health concerns. It was at Beswick House that Robert flourished and became an active, contributing member in his local community. He often helped preparing meals, aided in household tasks, and offered assistance to the more disabled residents in the house.</p><p>Robert came to love the community and companionship Beswick House offered and ways it enabled him to secure the structure, friendship and security he was unable to obtain prior to his residency. The support and compassion offered by the SHARP Foundation and supporting staff allowed Robert to pursue the life he truly wanted and deserved. Robert was able to participate in a community where he was understood and accepted, dramatically improving his health and well-being.</p><p>Robert happily resided at Beswick House for three years until his sudden passing in 2013.&nbsp; Over 50 people from all parts of the community came together to celebrate his life; he would have appreciated knowing that he had touched the hearts of so many!</p>"	"public://org_profile/SHARP Despair Oct 17 from FV.png"	"SHARP turns despair into hope - lonely man pictured"	"SHARP turns despair into hope - lonely man pictured"	"<p>For 25 years, SHARP has been providing care for Calgary&#39;s most vulnerable people who constantly struggle to overcome barriers to services needed to address their complex health and social needs.

There are times when Residents will be sound asleep, or in the tub room, soaking in a warm bath with calm, relaxing music playing on the stereo in the background. But the times I enjoy the most are when I am invited to share in the stories of a Resident&rsquo;s life and learn more about them and their journey at Agapé Hospice.</p><p>I will never forget the morning I first met John. When I walked into his room, he greeted me with a smile that was so welcoming and kind. In that moment it was hard to believe he was nearing the end of his life. John shared with me about the difficult decision to come to Agapé. Being a strong, independent and, at times, &ldquo;stubborn&rdquo; man, having to rely on others for care was a foreign concept. But, he quickly reassured me that his anxiety and hesitation were already put to rest. In the two days following his arrival, John felt like he was &ldquo;truly home.&rdquo; John delighted in the home cooked meals, especially the desserts, and the attentiveness of every individual who came to see him. His family had peace of mind knowing he was well taken care of and he felt so at home and at peace.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t long into his stay that John reconfigured his room to include a &ldquo;reception area.&rdquo; Our rooms on average are the same size as a junior office in a 10 storey building, not super large, so creating a &ldquo;reception area&rdquo; was no easy feat. But being able to transform his hospice room into his &ldquo;home&rdquo; complete with his favourite chair, a crème coloured worn leather recliner, and matching ottoman, was something that brought joy to all of us working that day. He was able to maneuver his TV into one corner of the room, his dresser into another corner, and his hospital bed was pushed against a wall which faced opposite to an east window that would brightly shine and fill the room with warmth on sunny days. The maneuvering worked out like a game of Tetris and as you opened the door to his room, you were greeted by a perfect little sitting area, with room for a bedside table, a folding chair, and of course his favourite recliner. Our morning ritual always began with John asking me to take a seat in his reception area. John would sit at the end of the bed, and I in his favorite chair brought from home. Our conversations were so varied: books, sports, the playful squirrels in the garden, and yet they always ended in the same way. John would grab a hold of my hand, look me in the eye and say, &ldquo;Thank you, to all of you, for all you do, this is such a wonderful place.&rdquo;</p><p>The morning before John died I went into his room to find his daughter keeping vigil in the infamous reception chair. I knew this was likely the last time I would be in John&rsquo;s sacred reception space. Being minimally responsive, I was not sure whether John would know I was in the room. To my surprise he squeezed my hand as he did during our morning visits. In that moment, I had no words to express the gratitude that I felt and the privilege of knowing this man, even for only a short time.</p><p>I have many of these encounters&hellip;I feel blessed to be in a place where the people that we love and serve also fill our hearts and spirit.</p><p>- Sarah Foster, Nursing Lead</p>"	"public://org_profile/Resident and Volunteer.jpg"	"The Salvation Army Agapé Hospice Volunteer and Resident share a moment"	"Agapé Hospice Volunteer and Resident share a moment"	"<p>The Salvation Army&nbsp;Agapé Hospice is a hospice providing a palliative care program with a special&nbsp;attitude in a special setting for individuals and their families dealing with a terminal illness.</p><p>Maximizing our Resident&rsquo;s quality of life while they are facing death is the primary focus of the hospice program and team.

"336"	"The Shakespeare Company Theatre in the Round Guild"	"21"	"<p>On a cold afternoon in October, Glenn Davis, the lead actor in The Shakespeare Company&#39;s smash hit <em>Othello</em> was heading out of the theatre after a vibrant student matinee. Having recently performed on Broadway with none other than the late Robin Williams in <em>Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo</em>, Glenn&#39;s resume is long and accomplished. As he walked towards the entrance of the theatre he was stopped by a young student who watched his performance in Othello.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;<em>Hey, are you the guy that was in that show</em>?&quot; asked the student.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;<em>Yeah that was me</em>.&quot; replied Glenn.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;<em>Before I came to this show I hated Shakespeare, it made no sense</em>.&quot; said the student. &quot;<em>I didn&#39;t even want to come. But you know what?</em>&quot;</p><p>&quot;<em>What?</em>&quot; Asked Glenn</p><p>&quot;<em>I understood everything!</em>&quot; &nbsp;said the student. &quot;<em>Shakespeare is AWESOME</em>!&quot; &nbsp;</p><p>We at the Shakespeare Company couldn&#39;t agree more,&nbsp;<strong>Shakespeare IS Awesome!</strong>&nbsp;For too long it&rsquo;s been perceived as being complicated, long, and hard to understand.</p><p>We make Shakespeare accessible, relevant and exciting, just as it was originally meant to be. We are committed to making great theatre for all to enjoy through innovative performances and inspired directing.</p><p>William Shakespeare is the greatest story teller of all time! We believe that theatre has the power to change us, to make us better, to help us understand, and to feel empathy. &nbsp;The Shakespeare Company exists so that those who come to witness our shows can be enlivened, enriched and inspired.&nbsp;</p><p><em>&quot;I appreciate the productions of Shakespeare company very much. They hold my interest, they are presented powerfully and I like the intimate theatre. I get a sense &nbsp;of why they stood the test of time as our human condition has not changed all that much. As a student in school I hated studying Shakespeare, it was boring and I didn&rsquo;t understand it.

"<p>In July 1995 the landscape of Calgary&rsquo;s theatre scene was dominated by the large regional theatres with only a few small professional companies producing regular seasons. &nbsp;The amateur theatre scene was thriving but it was difficult for young actors, and directors to find regular work in a professional setting. &nbsp;It was against this backdrop that Richard Kenyon, a graduate of the Vancouver Playhouse Acting School, was motivated to start The Shakespeare Company (TSC). &nbsp;From the beginning Richard and his co-founder LuAnne Morrow had two goals in mind: to produce the plays of Shakespeare on a regular basis in innovative and approachable ways and to operate as a professional company, paying the artists and crew who worked on the shows, even if only a small amount, as recognition of the theatre as a profession and the skills, training and effort it requires to produce a great show.</p><p>The first production The Shakespeare Company produced was&nbsp;<em>Henry V</em>&nbsp;and was performed in the round at the small space at the Pumphouse Theatre.&nbsp;</p><p>The spirit and energy of that first show infused the company for the next 16 years. The Shakespeare Company continued to produce 3-5 Shakespeare plays a year.&nbsp; They started a summer festival in Canmore and developed new plays inspired by Shakespeare. &nbsp;The works of Shakespeare were a constant inspiration and the feedback from audiences, many of whom were exposed to Shakespeare for the first time at TSC shows, was confirmation that the passion of the founders for the Bard went well beyond the company members. &nbsp;</p><p>In 2012 Haysam Kadri, took the helm of TSC as its new Artistic Producer. Determined to take the company to the next level, Kadri, a 6 year veteran of the Stratford Festival in Ontario, had three goals.&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Grow the audience. &nbsp;</li><li>Become more of an integral part of the Calgary Theatre scene.&nbsp;</li><li>Become the hottest ticket in town!&nbsp;</li></ol><p>In three short years, Haysam met all these goals and so much more.&nbsp; The Shakespeare Company is very proud of its many accomplishments. Here are some stats:</p><ul><li>Increased the number of students seeing our outreach shows by 53% (In 2011 the average number of students that saw our outreach shows was a little over 3500. In 2014 we will finish the year with having over 6000 students attend our outreach shows.)</li><li>Increased the number of public performances by 116% (in 2011 The Shakespeare Company produced, on average, 35 performances. As of 2014 we will have over 80 public performances.)</li><li>Increased the number of attendees to our performances by a staggering 480% &nbsp;(In 2011 the average number of overall attendees was just a little over 2000. In 2014 we our on track to see well over 12,000</li><li>Increased the number of artist we hire by almost 170% (In 2011 32 artists were hired. In 2014 we hired over 80 artists.)</li></ul><p>As The Shakespeare Company looks to the future we have new goals and new dreams. We look to have permanent home, continue to grow our subscription base, create a company that has an international reach and create a training ground for the classical actors of the future.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"	"public://org_profile/As You Like It 0505 NB2_2404-2.jpg"	""	""	"<p><strong>Mainstage Productions -&nbsp;</strong>Every year The Shakespeare Company produces 4 mainstage productions.

In addition to this we provide opportunities for emerging artists to work alongside seasoned actors and directors. Each year we employ 25-30 emerging artists.

Because Shakespeare&rsquo;s stories and characters are universal, his text is ideal for showcasing ethnic diversity- a quality Calgary has, but often does not highlight.&nbsp; With colour blind casting, strong artists will have an opportunity to tackle Shakespeare&rsquo;s best characters and bring a new perspective to Calgarians. Indeed, why not have an Asian Romeo, an Aboriginal Portia, and a Black Hamlet? Each artist&rsquo;s background will infuse their performance. Skin tone or ethnicity will not be a barrier for them to be cast, one step towards encouraging strong artists to stay in Calgary rather than seek work elsewhere and increasing the representation of the many faces of Calgary in theatre. DiVerseCity is also focused on accessibility for all Calgarians. The ensemble will perform Shakespearean scenes and monologues on platforms along the C-train line and other busy thoroughfares. Site specific theatre is less intimidating for non-theatre goers, and we&rsquo;re bringing Shakespeare for free to areas where people live and commute to work.. We will be partnering with local organizations to promote the events.&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.shakespearecompany.com/diversecity/"">http://www.shakespearecompany.com/diversecity/</a></p>"	"public://profiles/Othello 0251 NB2_5940.JPG"	""	""	"<p>The Shakespeare Company is nothing without our supporters and audience members.

It has allowed us to expand our creative horizons and become an important and nationally-recognized source of new, Canadian, large-scale theatrical works. It has allowed us to truly embrace our role as a leader in our artistic community, by allowing us to explore the new--new voices, new stories, new directions and new perspectives. In doing so, Theatre Calgary is able to continue moving forward as a vibrant and relevant contributor to the culture of our city and beyond.&nbsp;</p><p>Through the FUSE program, Theatre Calgary has developed 23 new plays and 8 of these have premiered on the main stage as part of Theatre Calgary&#39;s season. Many of these newly developed plays have enjoyed subsequent productions across the country. Most recently, Theatre Calgary produced <em>Liberation Days </em>by Calgary playwright David van Belle. Through several years of development&nbsp;through FUSE, this production was an artistic and box office success--adding an important voice to the Canadian theatre landscape.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"	"public://profiles/DaKinkCKC.jpg"	"Da Kink in my Hair at Theatre Calgary."

"775"	"Theatre Junction Society"	"22"	"<p>Theatre Junction has a new kind of vision. To be a different kind of arts centre. To evolve and expand its activities and be a place where our best artists in Calgary can develop and bring their work to the stage; where visual art, performance art and media like film and digital art create a hub of activity and exploration. To become a revitalized public space that increases its civic footprint, participates in the life of the city and creates a culture of innovation and learning through the arts.</p><p>That&rsquo;s a tall order for a small theatre in Calgary. However, we know things need to change: in this age of technological isolation people are seeking new ways to connect, to be inspired and get in touch with their own creativity and help make Calgary a great city. &nbsp;Arts centres need to provide new meaning and broaden their scope to include not just the arts, but arts-based practices that contribute to the life of the city.</p><p>Theatre Junction is stepping up its role. This season, our 26th, reflects that. We have a new slate of programming, in addition to our season of live art: film, dance and visual art as well as new offerings of arts-based opportunities for leadership and personal development. We want to connect, bring people into the space and participate in events that are happening throughout the city. Be in service to the community and an active participant in it: opening our doors for Doors Open YYC, 10 Minute Plays for Jane&rsquo;s Walk and Exposure photography festival were just a few things we did in our 2016/17 season and we will continue to expand on those.</p><p>Our award-winning high school mentorship program, TJLabs and our new program premiering in September, 2017, NEXT STAGE, creates a through line for artistic development and nurtures young artists to develop new work and present it to an audience. These programs alleviate the costs young companies face in Calgary: renting space, technical support and box office and marketing, allowing them to explore and create new work. Most importantly, it will foster a sense of belonging and an environment where artists can create and present work in Calgary.</p><p>And we need your help to do it. We need your help to become the culture house we aspire to be: one that brings a plethora of artistic events and experiences to the city, but incubates the next generation of artists in Calgary.</p>"	"public://org_profile/wood_map_smaller.jpg"	"Map of the world created in plywood by Daniel J.

The shows we present often use text, music, dance and physicality to immerse the audience in a collective experience. These are shows you won&#39;t see anywhere else, and sometimes not even elsewhere in Canada.</p><p>We believe that a successful city has a vibrant and rich arts culture, where people can engage in multiple offerings and disciplines. It is also a place where artists can live, and create and perform work. Artists face many barriers to living a successful life in Calgary and we aim to reduce those barriers by offering programs and activities that are free for artists to develop their work over time. Mentorship, TJLabs, Next Stage and our Jane&#39;s Walk event, 10 Minute Plays for Jane&#39;s Walk are just a few of the opportunities we provide to artists throughout the year.</p><p>In order for arts centres like Theatre Junction to evolve and remain relevant to their audience, and to artists, we are shifting our vision from one that is primarily inwardly focused, to one that is rooted in Community. Developing programs that bring artists, students, members of the public and corporate communitiy together to learn and develop their creativity through arts-based practices creates a richer fabric and deeper cultural connection. &nbsp;Participating in Jane&#39;s Walk events through 10 Minute Plays, hosting open space gatherings for artists and arts centres to talk about how to support arts culture in Calgary and looking at themes like prosperity through an arts lens are ways we will be relevant to the Calgary community.</p>"	"public://org_profile/image2.JPG"	"Map of Calgary with sticky notes where people imagine what the city can be."

We do this through many different programs and offerings:</p><p><strong><a href=""http://www.theatrejunction.com/high-school-mentorship-program/"">High School Mentorship </a></strong>- accredited by the Calgary Board of Education, 15-20 high school students have the opportunity to research, develop and present a play they develop with the support of a local playwright and Theatre Junction Associate Artist. This two-year program develops personal and interpersonal skills, grows confidence and provides students the opportunity to develop theatre skills. At the end of the two years, the students present their work on our main stage, the Flanagan Theatre. Our current playwright in residence is award winning playwright Geoffrey Simon Brown.</p><p><strong><a href=""http://www.theatrejunction.com/tj-labs/"">TJLabs</a></strong> - helping artists and emerging collectives explore new work and get it ready to present to an audience is the goal of TJLAbs. Three phases of this program, incubation, discovery and help artists develop their work. We provide free studio time, technical support, dramaturgy and help with marketing/promotion.</p><p><strong><a href=""http://www.theatrejunction.com/masterclass/"">Masterclasses</a></strong> - having the opportunity to work with a professional and glean insight from their style, experience and methods are the goalsl of Masterclasses. Visiting artists provide a day-long workshop with interested professionals in our studio. Masterclasses are free.</p><p><a href=""http://www.theatrejunction.com/next-stage/""><strong>Next Stage</strong></a> - our newest program, offered in the 2017/18 season. Four new or mid-career artists/companies will receive free studio time, tech support and have the opportunity to present their work to an audience. This program removes barriers most artists face in presenting live art in Calgary: affordable space, professional technical support and marketing. Next Stage provides all of this, and shares box office revenue with the artists to sustain the program.</p>"	"public://profiles/IMG_1387 copy.jpeg"	"high school students performing in Concord Floral in April, 2016"	"High School Mentorship production of Concord Floral 2015/16 season"	"<p><strong><a href=""https://tickets.vendini.com/donation-software.html?t=donation&amp;d=17fb83854592f009222b9a34e7a0a29a&amp;vqitq=1ac38ed7-1e1e-491c-ac4f-ee9f83a27a86&amp;vqitp=de49e439-9398-46b2-8955-3e9a449912fa&amp;vqitts=1479790564&amp;vqitc=vendini&amp;vqite=itl&amp;vqitrt=Safetynet&amp;vqith=de555b5f91a47f87a1f13c142a6980b3&amp;vqitq=bc751b53-0420-4e4d-8905-58b75e854c5a&amp;vqitp=4179a699-9d9e-47c0-b9b4-1f93da9071fe&amp;vqitts=1495748626&amp;vqitc=vendini&amp;vqite=itl&amp;vqitrt=Safetynet&amp;vqith=61fc76b2869acb3b99862c335252c931"">Support Theatre Junction&nbsp;</a></strong></p><p>By donating to Theatre Junction, donors will:</p><ul><li>support the development and nurturing of new and emerging artists in Calgary, fostering a rich cultural vibrancy in the city.</li><li>support a multidisciplinary program of live art, visual art, music and film.

During a hospital stay for unrelated issues, complications caused a complete loss of vision. Devastated by this development, he became despondent and paranoid,&nbsp;believing that his physicians caused his blindness. His mistrust of doctors meant he wasn&rsquo;t getting the healthcare he needed and&nbsp;he sent home care providers away.</p><p>Further complicating his situation, Arthur developed a syndrome in which&nbsp;individuals with partial or severe blindness experience complex visual hallucinations. This combination of factors and&nbsp;a the lack of family or a social support network meant that Arthur became a recluse, isolating himself from society, and from the care that he needed.</p><p>A social worker at TPFA recognized that Arthur was an ideal candidate for the&nbsp;Independent Living Skills (ILS) program funded by the Calgary Foundation. He had little or no social or family support, was socially isolated, and could benefit from additional help to maintain his quality of life. The ILS worker worked with Arthur to encourage him to take small steps to come out of his shell. Once a week, the ILS worker took Arthur for a walk or went for coffee with him and checked to make sure Arthur had the groceries he needed. The ILS worker also connected him with CNIB for shopping support.</p><p>&ldquo;<em>I could see that Arthur was becoming more comfortable with me</em>,&rdquo; the ILS worker commented, &rdquo;<em>Because each time we had an appointment he was dressed and ready to go when I arrived</em>.&rdquo;</p><p>Although Arthur still isn&rsquo;t comfortable talking to doctors, and in fact hasn&rsquo;t seen one in two years, the ILS workers were able to convince him to see a nurse practitioner when he wasn&rsquo;t feeling well.&nbsp;Arthur and the nurse practitioner have set up a medical plan for him, so in case of an emergency, Arthur will get &ndash; and accept &ndash; the help he needs.</p><p>&ldquo;<em>I can confidently say that the ILS program has dramatically improved Arthur&rsquo;s quality of life,</em>&rdquo; asserts the ILS worker. &ldquo;<em>He had kind of given up. He didn&rsquo;t see that there could be any other way of life, and had resigned himself to the fact that God would take him soon</em>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<em>His outlook has changed completely,</em>&rdquo; another ILS worker adds, &ldquo;<em>He is looking to the future &ndash; making plans for weeks from now.

"<p><strong>Fe</strong> was an active senior who enjoyed cooking, baking and chasing after her grandkids. At the age of 61, she suffered a stroke that left her with partial paralysis. Whether using a wheelchair or walker, regular chores like cooking, loading the dishwasher and putting away the dishes became impossible in her apartment.</p><p>Frustrated by this lack of independence, Fe and her husband decided to make the move to a housing complex that was affordable and wheelchair accessible. A friend recommended Trinity Place Foundation&rsquo;s Glenway Gate. The barrier-free design, spacious layouts and accessible appliances were all features that would improve their day-to-day living and give Fe her independence back.</p><p>With cupboards that raise and lower at the push of a button, an accessible stove and side-loading dishwasher, Fe has taken over the kitchen again -- something both she and her husband are happy about. They are also happy about the feeling of community at Glenway Gate. From coffee klatches in the lounge to barbecues on the patio, the residents truly feel like neighbours, making Glenway Gate truly feel like home. Glenway Gate is a model for enhancing independence through careful attention to design and accessibility.</p><p><strong>Wayne</strong>&nbsp;became involved in TPFA&#39;s Independent Living Skills (ILS) program when neighbours alerted&nbsp;staff&nbsp;to&nbsp;concerns over Wayne&rsquo;s declining health. In less than six months he&rsquo;d lost almost 80lbs and had aged dramatically. When the team visited him for the first time he was barely able to catch a breath and hadn&rsquo;t eaten for almost two weeks. Due to a previous experience, Wayne had anxiety about seeking medical care and refused to see a doctor. The team offered to accompany him to urgent care, where it was discovered he had a severe lung infection requiring urgent hospitalization.</p><p>Following his return home from hospital two weeks later, ILS workers helped Wayne get his apartment set up to manage his recovery, connected him with a number of community services, and checked in on him regularly. He is back in his apartment now, where he continues to recover and is living healthier. He has developed better eating habits and no longer requires a walker to get around. Wayne credits the&nbsp;ILS staff for saving his life.</p><p><strong>WHAT WE DO</strong></p><p>At TPFA we recognize that as people age they are often confronted and confounded by&nbsp;changes to their mental or physical health. These issues may jeopardize a person&rsquo;s confidence, judgement, and&nbsp;ability to maintain a good quality of life.&nbsp;The ILS program provides tangible and practical ways to&nbsp;assist tenants to&nbsp;recover their independence and&nbsp;to age in place.

"<p><strong>Independent Living Skills (ILS)</strong></p><p>This innovative pilot project was initiated by TPFA to help address the social isolation of seniors and help residents maintain their independence and quality of life by better managing tasks of daily living. The program helps residents who may be struggling with issues exacerbated by physical or mental changes associated with aging. With a persistent shortage of affordable supportive housing in Calgary, more low income seniors are living independently but sometimes lack the supports they need to manage the tasks of daily living during an illness or following a stay&nbsp;in the hospital.</p><p>This pilot project&nbsp;is funded by&nbsp;the Government of Canada, the New Horizons program, and by the Calgary Foundation enabling&nbsp;TPFA to employ two ILS workers who provide support to 80 seniors.

Some examples of how they can help include:</p><ul><li>Helping navigate the health care system to find the right services and programs</li><li>Providing tools and services to deal with the emotional aspects of aging</li><li>Helping to access government benefits and other programs available to seniors</li><li>Finding the right community resources</li></ul><p><strong>Intergenerational program to reduce isolation</strong></p><p>Inspired by a unique project in Red Deer, TPFA recognized that the vacancy situation in one our buildings was an opportunity to be creative.

After years of advocacy and effort, Peter Coyle Place was&nbsp;built and opened in 2005. TPFA consulted with&nbsp;colleagues&nbsp;in Western Canada and refined the design of the structure and the harm reducation philosophy of care to suit older adults with complex medical needs.</p><p>The result is a modern 70-unit supportive care facility&nbsp;that truly benefits seniors with complex medical needs. Medical supports are offered by the Alex Seniors Clinic through an&nbsp;innovative partnership with the Alex Seniors&rsquo; Health Centre. Home Care and personal care is&nbsp;made available through a site based Home Care program.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Alex Seniors&rsquo; Health Centre </strong></p><p>About&nbsp;15 years ago, the Alex Medical Clinic in Inglewood was being asked to find a new home. TPFA recognized that there was space available to accommodate a medical clinic in King Tower and within months, the Alex Seniors Clinic was on site.&nbsp;</p><p>Timely access to medical care was difficult for many tenants who did not have a personal physician. It made perfect sense to work closely with the Alex. This long-term partnership has resulted in decreased emergency medical visits and hospitalizations because a tenant can now easily walk to the clinic and be seen by one of the excellent Alex medical staff.</p><p><strong>Diversified communities support inclusive living</strong></p><p>Located in the heart of Glamorgan, Glenway Gate serves an important need in the community. By offering a mix of affordable and market units, TPFA has created an inclusive community for the older adult population who desire to remain in the community, close to friends and local amenities such as banks and shopping.</p><p>Twelve of the building&rsquo;s 42 suites are barrier-free and incorporate many accessibility features to ensure the building meets the unique needs of seniors with mobility challenges. Communities become complete when diverse housing forms are developed that allow people to move through the phases of life and remain in the community.

Most were delighted for this opportunity &ndash; except Albert. Having never ridden a bike before in his life &ndash; he expressed that he would rather just walk his bike home and practice privately. With a little encouragement and riding tips from the facilitators &amp; volunteers, Albert gathered his newfound confidence and within ten minutes was riding alongside the others &ndash; his smile as big as the soccer field.</p><p>Most people have a &ldquo;First Bike&rdquo; story. They can often remember the details of their first cycling experience. Who they were with, where they were and how they felt biking for the first time.

TWV is a mission driven organization that creates opportunities for young people to learn and practice lessons in leadership, health and wellness, self-esteem, achievement, and environmental stewardship through their participation in bicycle education programs and bike trips.</p><p>TWV believes that all youth should have the opportunity to expand their physical and cultural boundaries. There are many youth that are never exposed to what may provide the greatest source of learning - real life experiences that bring home valuable insights and logical steps for positive change.</p><p>Rick and Tanya McFerrin founded TWV in 2000 after a two-year bicycle expedition around the world. Their experiences and perspectives on the world, as seen from the seat of a bike, created the basis for TWV.</p><p>-----</p><p><strong>OUR FIVE YEAR PLAN</strong></p><p>Over the next 5-years, TWV will serve more than 3,000 youth through high impact after school programs, community education and expedition programs.</p><p><strong>GOAL 1: Become Leaders in Youth Development Programming</strong></p><ul><li>TWV will serve 2,000 youth in 25 new program locations in Calgary.</li><li>TWV will serve 1,000 youth &amp; community leaders in 50 Community Education Programs.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>GOAL 2: Become Leaders in Youth Cycling Expeditions</strong></p><ul><li>TWV will lead 35 expeditions for 350 youth in Canada, USA, Argentina, and Norway.</li><li>Engage host communities in program development and cultural exchange.</li></ul><p><strong>GOAL 3: Strengthen Organizational Capacity for Long Term Success</strong></p><ul><li>Develop local and national partnerships to extend TWV reach.</li><li>Raise TWV profile in Calgary, nationally and abroad.</li></ul>"	"public://org_profile/IMG_5992.JPG"	""	""	"<p>TWV programs increase youth resiliency and lessen risk factors of students through cognitive development, social competence, and emotional and physical wellbeing; thus increasing their likelihood of future success. We do this in two ways:</p><p>The Earn-a-Bike &#39;Bike Club&#39; program uses the bike as a tool to develop leadership and teamwork skills as well as bike mechanic capabilities in youth ages 11-17. Each week participants come to program where they receive a healthy snack, play games and discuss the daily lessons in both character (community, leadership, self-esteem) and bike mechanics (fixing a tire, gear adjustments, chains, brakes etc). They have the opportunity to use tools and disassemble and reassemble bikes every week.</p><h3>In Bike Club youth:</h3><ul><li>Use tools and learn about bikes and bike mechanics</li><li>Take part in active games,, bike rides and have fun</li><li>Eat healthy snacks, practice leadership skill and gain confidence</li><li>Earn a bike, lock and helmet of their own</li></ul><p>For many of our participants, this is the only way they can afford to get a bike. More than just a toy, these bikes are helping our youth get to school, to part-time jobs or to other after school activities as well as keeping them physically active. Our program builds confidence and teaches them life-long skills in a safe, encouraging and hands-on learning environment. They also have the opportunity to connect with positive adult mentors who provide guidance, friendship and support during the program.</p><p>Our Bike Trip programs target students 14 years old and older, allowing them connect with the natural environment and actively participate in an adventurous experience. Imagine spending a few weeks riding a bike through a remote region of Argentina or Norway, cycling the scenic bikeways in Quebec or riding into western Canada&rsquo;s mountain parks &ndash; experiencing outdoor adventure, exploring new cultures, expanding your mind.</p><p>TWV offers a grass-roots approach to bicycle travel that allow students to take part in daily trip planning, engage with local communities, participate in service-learning projects and raise their level of environmental and social awareness. Participants gain strength, confidence, and perspective as they create memories that will last a lifetime. The TWV Trips are open to students and groups from all regions of Canada and the USA, cultures, religions, ethnic groups and economic circumstances.</p>"	"public://profiles/IMG_552258.jpg"	""	""	"<p>There are many great ways you can get involved with Two Wheel View:</p><ul><li>Make a donation to support our programs.&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.canadahelps.org/dn/14978"">https://www.canadahelps.org/dn/14978</a></li><li>Donate your old bike to our Earn-a-Bike program at the Good Life Community Bike Shop (2100 4th St. SW) and give a youth their&nbsp;&ldquo;First Bike&rdquo; story.&nbsp;</li><li>Volunteer your mechanical skills to fix up bike donations for our Earn-a-Bike participants at one of our volunteer nights.

Due to a lack of blood and oxygen to the brain, Simon was diagnosed with spastic quadriplegia Cerebral Palsy along with a seizure and pain disorder. This diagnosis was life alternating, not only for Simon, but his parents, Liz and Andre.</p><p>Many questions went unanswered as only time would tell how Simon&rsquo;s disability would affect his quality of life and the typical milestones of childhood development.</p><p>The first few years were difficult for both Simon and his parents. Many days were spent attempting to sooth Simon through constant holding and physical contact and distractions in the form of music. As he was unable to communicate his needs, wants or desires, Simon&rsquo;s parents were left wondering what was causing their little boy to cry all day. Between working and caring for medically fragile child, the family was soon overwhelmed and their role of parents transitioned into the role of full time caregivers.</p><p>Simon&rsquo;s health needs increased in complexity as did the amount of daily medications, supplements and personal care. Simon soon had an exhaustive list of medical professionals from surgeons, specialists, nurses, and physiotherapists. Simon&rsquo;s parents continued to adapt to their son&rsquo;s ever changing medical needs and learned to manage complex medical regimes.</p><p>Simon was unable to tolerate the use of a wheelchair, sleep independently or leave the family home. Simon&rsquo;s parents spent many days and nights holding and rocking him, trying to take away their son&rsquo;s discomfort and pain. Mentally, physically, and emotionally the overall family unit began to crumble. They were alone and afraid of the unknown for their son and family.</p><p>On September 1, 2012 Liz and Andre made the toughest decision of their lives and choose to have Simon permanently placed in care. For parents to make a decision like this for their five year old son was heartbreaking. They did not know if they were doing the right thing.</p><p>And then there was a break in the clouds. His parents no longer needed to be Simon&rsquo;s nurses and caretakers. They only had to be one thing, his mom and dad.</p><p>Over a number of months, a routine was developed and a plan was set in place and as Simon became familiar with his various caregivers and environment, positive changes started to occur. With support and guidance, Simon&rsquo;s parents continued transitioning into their role of mom and dad. They no longer were required to monitor, manage and implement Simon&rsquo;s complex medications and care routines. They were able to focus on their son, family, and rebuilding personal relationships. Soon the family unit began to flourish.</p><p>Simon excelled in a multitude of areas both developmentally and physically. Simon now uses his wheelchair on a daily basis, sleeps alone and tolerates new, loud and what would have been overwhelming environments, strengthening his independence. Simon started exploring the city and participated in many events outside the home like the Calgary Zoo and swimming.</p><p>A milestone achievement was accomplished when Simon successfully completed his first year of school, attending fulltime, five days a week. Simon continues to amaze his parents and family as he reaches goals and truly demonstrates the level of excellence one can achieve in life. Simon&#39;s parents continue to be heavily involved in his personal growth and development through their daily visits to the home. Through laughter, cuddling, music, and participation in family activities, the family is now truly thriving. This cannot be more evident as Simon recently became a big brother and welcomed the newest member to the family, his sister, Stella.</p><p>Simon continues to teach each individual he comes into contact with that love, happiness, and joy goes hand in hand with a child with a development disability. He has excelled both developmentally, physically and emotionally and will continue to accomplish goals his parents never dreamed were possible for him.</p>"	"public://org_profile/simon 6.png"	"Simon and his family"	"Meet Simon, whose diagnosis was life altering for him - and his parents. "	"<p>Before 1985, it was common belief that individuals with disabilities could not survive in the community and would have to be placed in institutions. URSA challenged that belief and in 1985, opened five residential homes to 30 clients from Calgary&rsquo;s Baker Centre. These five homes were just that, homes. These clients not only survive in the community setting, they thrive. URSA now has 16 homes in Calgary. The majority of these individuals have very significant and multiple disabilities including; requiring feeding, personal care support for bathing/ hygiene, and 24-hour staff support for all areas of life. One of these homes is URSA&rsquo;s children&rsquo;s home which provides care for those under 18 years old. Another is our Kootenay Lodge home, a home for at-risk aboriginal adults with disabilities.</p><ul><li>In the early 90&rsquo;s URSA expanded into brain injury services and developed Easy Street &ndash; an indoor city block with a diner, taxi cab, grocery store, beauty shop, bus, bank, and apartment. A safe place for clients to learn and relearn everyday skills.</li></ul><ul><li>URSA also has several day programs for our clients to attend. Clients are able to participate in any number of activities and outings including: crafting; gardening; swimming; visits to the zoo and TELUS Spark; day trips out of the city; etc. Anything our clients want to do, they go out and do it!</li></ul><ul><li>In 2009, URSA opened Camp URSA &ndash; a recreational facility out of the city that is fully wheelchair accessible. An opportunity for individuals with disabilities or a brain injury to escape the city and relax with family, friends, or caregivers. The wheelchair accessibility means that clients have no physical barriers and can enjoy the camp to the fullest. Camp URSA provides bedding, linen and meals to campers to help make the trip easier to plan and more enjoyable. It is a chance for clients to get out of the city and enjoy mother nature.</li></ul><p>URSA continues to grow and develop and we currently have 23 programs including: 24/7 homes, day programs, brain injury service programs, a children&rsquo;s home, an aboriginal home, and accessible camp. URSA makes it possible for individuals with disabilities to live and thrive in Calgary communities. We ensure not only the basic necessities for these individuals are provided, but go above and beyond ensuring individual goals and dreams are made a reality so that they can live the fullest life possible.</p><p><strong>MISSION </strong>| To develop and provide opportunities for individuals with disabilities to attain a personal level of achievement and excellence in life!</p><p><strong>VISION </strong>| To provide an excellent service to individuals and their families to maximize quality of life in a &quot;wholistic&quot; manner.</p>"	"public://org_profile/Picture13.png"	"Our individuals - 12th Avenue Clients"	"Our clients not only survive in the community setting, they thrive!"

This is a life-changing experience not only the individuals we serve, but for staff and volunteers as well. For 30 years, some people have never left their home or institution before coming to URSA.</p><p>Donations to URSA will directly benefit URSA clients. These items will all have a direct impact on URSA clients and will be used for items or experiences our clients may not be able to afford on their own.

Roger has been with URSA since Baker Centre closed, over 30 years ago. He came with a bag of clothes, some small personal items, and no friends or family connections.</p><p>Roger is non-verbal, in a wheelchair and is on AISH (Assured Income for the Severely Handicapped); AISH covers his accommodations and food, but not much else. Roger likes the color green; actually that&rsquo;s an understatement, Roger LOVES the color green. Last year a corporate volunteer group of 20 people came and did a &ldquo;while you were out&rdquo; day of caring. They redid four URSA client bedrooms, including Roger&rsquo;s. They bought him new bedroom furniture, bedding, a new lamp, and art for his walls. They also painted his room (for the first time in over 20 years) a nice shade of, yes, green. Roger came home that afternoon and was shown his new room by his staff. No one was sure how he was going to react to his new room, especially with 20 strangers watching him. He paused at his door. He slowly rolled over to the newly painted green wall and very gently rubbed his hand along it. He smiled. It was quite evident that Roger was thrilled with his new room, filled with green.</p><p><em>You can change a life by the simplest donation of your time. </em></p><p>URSA&rsquo;s While you Were Out campaigns are a great way to get involved and directly impact someone&rsquo;s life, like Roger, and are perfect for team building. These can include:</p><ul><li>Redoing a client room for them while they are out of the house (painting, new furniture, new bedding and lighting, etc.)</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Yard cleanup and planting. All our homes require assistance with gardening and yard cleaning every spring and fall. Our clients greatly enjoy getting in the dirt and assisting in making their yards summer ready.</li></ul><p>Other volunteer opportunities include:</p><ul><li>Joining our brain injury clients on their Rehab on the Mountain trips. Three trips to the mountains happen each year with 10 clients. Volunteers can spend the day with clients helping them participate in the multitude of activities including: skiing, white water rafting, hiking, horse back riding, dog sledding, and more!</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Helping URSA put on events for our clients including: Stampede Bar-B-Q, URSA Games, and the Client Christmas Party. Volunteers can help make and serve food to clients and participate in the fun!</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Spending one-on-one time with clients. This can include: reading to them, playing board games, arts &amp; crafts, swimming, joining them at the Talisman Centre &ndash; whatever your interests are, our clients are interested too.</li></ul><p>The possible volunteer opportunities are endless and make great team building activities.

The strongest recommendation from the conference was for the development of an Aboriginal youth council to assist the Mayor of Calgary in decisions of policy and strategy on issues concerning Aboriginal Youth in the city. With this recommendation in mind, Mr. Little Chief coordinated a roundtable to discuss the opportunities and strategies of the council. From this roundtable the Mayor&rsquo;s Aboriginal Youth Advisory Committee (MAYAC) was formed.</p><p>Armed with fresh ideas and the support of Mayor Al Duerr, MAYAC formed a board of a second entity, the Urban Society for Aboriginal Youth (USAY). In 2000, USAY hosted the 1st Annual Firekeepers Gathering aimed at assisting Aboriginal youth with issues concerning personal achievement in an urban setting. The success of the Firekeepers Gathering encouraged the board to explore other opportunities for Aboriginal youth in Calgary, and to see where USAY could provide services to ensure the experience of living in Calgary for Aboriginal youth is a positive one.</p><p>In 2001, with support from Family and Community Support Services, United Way of Calgary and Area, the Métis Nation of Alberta and Alberta Community Development, USAY was established as a not-for-profit organization and began paving the way as one of Calgary&rsquo;s leading organizations for Aboriginal youth.</p><p>Today, USAY continues to serve Calgary&rsquo;s Aboriginal community and provide youth with opportunities for advancement through board and volunteer opportunities.&nbsp;USAY will continue to seek out new opportunities and develop programming that will help and encourage Aboriginal youth to live healthy and successful lives in the city of Calgary.</p><p>Thank you for your support to help USAY make the goals, dreams and aspirations of our members a reality.</p><p><br />&nbsp;</p>"	"public://org_profile/new.PNG"	"USAY image projected in lights on a screen"	"USAY hosted the 1st Annual Firekeepers Gathering for Aboriginal youth"	"<p><strong>The following is a list and brief description of the programs implemented by USAY:</strong></p><p><strong>Aboriginal Recruitment Strategy </strong></p><p>The Aboriginal Recruitment Strategy was created to help Aboriginal youth that have dropped out of school to re-engage in learning, whether it is a traditional school setting, alternative sources of learning, life skills programs or vocational programming. The partnership between Calgary Board of Education and USAY allows us to recruit Aboriginal youth who are hoping to return to school and seamlessly transition them back into a system that supports their success.</p><p><strong>Aboriginal Youth Mentorship Program (AYMP)</strong></p><p>Mentoring plays a key role for Aboriginal youth success in school and eventual high school completion. The AYMP program creates three tiers of mentoring within one program - adults, teens and children:</p><ul><li>Adults mentor teens</li><li>The same teens mentor children</li></ul><p>This model allows those youth at-risk in high school gain role modeling and mentoring from an adult, and they receive leadership skills by becoming a mentor and role model to a child.</p><p><strong>Aboriginal Anti-Racism Movement Program (AARM)</strong></p><p>AARM is a weekly meeting for youth to challenge their beliefs and the attitudes of others through the use of creative mediums. By providing opportunities for participants to practice and develop skills that promote self-esteem and self-confidence, AARM aims to help deconstruct the walls of racism that are all too prevalent in society.</p><p>AARM is an intensive program. It is not meant to reach a large amount of youth in a small way, but rather a small group of youth in a meaningful, positive way.</p><p><strong>Aboriginal Student Achievement Program (ASAP)</strong></p><p>The ASAP program creates an incentive for youth to be successful in school. The program provides participants with a series of small financial rewards for increases in academic grades during the academic year, up to a maximum of $1,000 per year.</p><p><strong>Aboriginal Youth International Trip</strong></p><p>This project provides an international learning experience for Aboriginal youth that have been in active in USAY&rsquo;s programs for three or more consecutive years. In most cases, youth that attend this international opportunity have successfully graduated from high school and are transitioning from USAY&rsquo;s programming into post-secondary or employment.

Allowing an entire edition to be dedicated to one topic allows for unspoken stories to be told, critical information to be shared and complex questions to be asked. These editions promote open dialogue and raise awareness about important issues.

"393"	"Verb Theatre Society"	"24"	"<p>I often think that some of the most powerful theatrical experiences I&rsquo;ve had over the years are the ones I didn&#39;t see coming, <strong>the ones I didn&#39;t know I needed to see until I saw them</strong>. The ones that surprised me. As a director, I still enjoy those surprises from inside a project (thankfully!) and this is what I love about what we offer at Verb. You may not know what to expect at a Verb show, but you can expect the unexpected. You can be sure we&rsquo;ll surprise you.</p><p>In 2012, we embarked on a bit of an ambitious project called <em>NOISE: A Musical for Deaf and Hearing Audiences</em>. In a sentence, our goal had been to create a show that both Deaf and hearing audiences could enjoy and experience equally and simultaneously, without the aid of sign language interpreters or translators. In another sentence, we wanted to experiment with what Deaf performance could offer traditional theatre performance. For example, we turned sign-language poetry into both dance and song so that both hearing and Deaf audiences could access the meaning.</p><p>The show was a lot of things &ndash; wild, experimental, complex, innovative &ndash; but the thing that always sticks with me about this show was the audience response to our &ldquo;approach&rdquo; to the show. Some people loved it, some people hated it, some people (for better or worse) were brought to tears. What was cool, though, was that most people were surprised by it.</p><p>What&rsquo;s more, half of these people were Deaf and half were hearing, and by attending the show, they were able to see the world through the other&rsquo;s eyes for a bit. One mother commented that this was the first time she&rsquo;d been able to attend a performance with her Deaf daughter, and though I didn&rsquo;t know enough sign language to understand their conversation, they left the theatre with hands excitedly buzzing over their shared experience at our show.</p><p>Knowing that we&rsquo;ve offered something to someone that they didn&rsquo;t know they needed is the fuel that keeps our fire lit here at Verb.</p>"	"public://org_profile/Jim_Donna-2.jpg"	"Woman looking tenderly while embracing a man's face"	"Offering something new is the fuel that lights our fire!"	"<p>Since 2008, Verb Theatre has served Calgary a variety of theatrical dishes designed to explore what&rsquo;s important at that that moment for our community and beyond. The way we express this varies from year to year, show to show, but at the heart of our programming lies an interest in tapping into conversations and ideas that we think matter today and will matter even more to you tomorrow.</p><p><strong>WE CHALLENGE THE FORM</strong></p><p>In the age of &nbsp;our dearly beloved Netflix, it has become clear that theatre can still offer many things that no computer screen can. At Verb, we&rsquo;re always exploring the modes of performance that serve today&rsquo;s theatre goers&hellip; and maybe, more importantly, tomorrow&rsquo;s. Over the years we&rsquo;ve used our stage in amazing ways: non-linear structures to help an audience see the world through the eyes of an early-onset Alzheimer&rsquo;s patient; sign-language-based song and dance to help bring Deaf and hearing audiences together; documentary theatre to bring a personal touch to the Physician Assisted Dying debate; participatory theatre; hyper minimalism; site-specific performance, and more. We believe that the live stage has much to offer in an age where so much is digital, and a key tenant of our mission is to find and share with you the theatre of the 21st century.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>WE INSPIRE CONVERSATION</strong></p><p>Ideas have a way of entering in and out of the collective societal conversation in waves, and at Verb, we surf at the front of these waves. For example, we created a documentary theatre project about Doctor Assisted Dying a year before the issue re-entered the supreme court, and were thrilled to continue contributing to that conversation as the topic made its way to the headlines. Each play we create or produce is specifically chosen for the way it contributes to or even incites a conversation that we think is important, interesting, and imminent. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>PROFESSIONAL AND INCLUSIVE</strong></p><p>We hire professional artists to help us connect with the community at large. Many of our shows have been created with the support of community organizations that help us reach new audiences and even introduce us to individuals whose voices become part of the shows we create. Our professional artists have been critically celebrated and our award-winning teams are regularly recognized through awards and nominations at the Calgary Theatre Critics&rsquo; Awards and the Betty Mitchell Professional Theatre Awards. Visit verbtheatre.com to learn about the ways our work has been celebrated.</p>"	"public://org_profile/Marg-13 Crop_3x5.jpg"	"Female actor sitting comfortably on the stage."	"We incite conversations that we think are important, interesting, and imminent"	"<p><strong>PREMIERES OF NEW (AND NEW-TO-US) PLAYS</strong></p><p>Each year, we produce a play that is brand new to Calgary, to Alberta, to Canada, or even to the world! Some of these are important plays from across the globe that we just need to share with Calgary (like our 2015 production of <em>Lungs</em> by UK playwright Duncan MacMillan) and some are of our own creation, like our world premiere of <em>Jim Forgetting</em> by Verb&rsquo;s own Col Cseke.</p><p>In the 2015/16 season, we are proud to present the world premiere of a work that&rsquo;s been in development here at Verb for a few years, ever since a local actor/athlete approached us with an idea about creating a play that uses Mixed Martial Arts as a performance vocabulary. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong><em>THE FIGHT OR FLIGHT RESPONSE</em></strong> by Col Cseke will punch, kick, and bite its way to the stage in March 2016. Featuring Justin Michael Carriere and Nathan Pronyshyn, both trained MMA athletes who also happen to be professional actors, this show is sure to be one of the most physically rigorous and electric shows you&rsquo;ll ever see. This show explores, jabs, and bobs around themes of masculinity, violence, and control.</p><p><strong>NEW PLAY DEVELOPMENT</strong></p><p>Some of the work we want to see on Calgary stages just doesn&rsquo;t exist yet, so we get to build it! In the past, we&rsquo;ve developed new plays over the course of two or three years before it sees a public audience. For the future, we are building new structures of play development formally into our programming.</p><p>In 2015/16, we are thrilled to announce two new initiatives:</p><ul><li><a href=""http://www.verbtheatre.com/commission/""><strong>PROFESSIONAL COMMISSION </strong></a>&ndash; In September, 2015, we announced a call for proposals from professional playwrights who are interested in creating the kind of work we do at Verb. Over the coming years, this playwright and their work will receive financial and production support from Verb as we encourage Canadian playwrights to explore new forms and modes of performance. We hope to produce this playwright&rsquo;s work in a coming season.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><a href=""http://www.verbtheatre.com/experiment-lab/""><strong>EXPERIMENT LAB </strong></a>&ndash; In September, 2015, we also announced our that 2015/16 will see Verb supporting artists in-studio with our experiment labs, designed to help artists working through creative questions and hypotheses for creating work for the 21st century. These labs will offer artists financial assistance, rehearsal space, and time to play with a creative concept before taking it to the stage. We hope that this lab will light up some diamonds in the rough that will shine in a future Verb season.</li></ul>"	"public://profiles/IMG_1042_Crop_3x5.jpg"	"Actor in front of screen revealing a sketched face"	"Some important global plays just need to be shared with Calgary."

At first it was a struggle &ndash; cajoling, negotiating and pushing her to attend the twice-weekly classes. Gradually though, we noticed her excitement increase as her self-confidence began to blossom. As her fitness level and hand-eye coordination improved, so did her keenness to attend the sessions. Not only was she affected physically, but her greater belief in herself improved her willingness to share and socialize with other participants and her instructors. As a result, we&rsquo;ve witnessed the emergence of a better-quality relationship with her brothers and sister at home and a willingness to put herself out there and try new things.

"284"	"Volunteer Airdrie Society"	"24"	"<p>My name is Ryan, I&rsquo;m 15 and I go to St Martin De Pores. I have been actively volunteering for 6 years through associations like Volunteer Airdrie, Ronald McDonald House, Airdrie Boys and Girls Club and Brown Bagging for Calgary&rsquo;s kids.</p><p>The first time I volunteered I was 8. My mom brought me to an event at her Gap store, we were selling hot dogs and hamburgers to raise money for their lunch program with Brown Bagging for Calgary&rsquo;s Kids. I spent my day asking people if they wanted to buy a lunch, and how one lunch for them equaled 5 lunches for kids in our schools.</p><p>Back then helping other people wasn&rsquo;t the reason I volunteered, I volunteered because it was&nbsp;fun and I was hanging out with my family. Which in my opinion is the biggest reason for youth&nbsp;to start volunteering. Even for myself - only until recently did I look at volunteering as not only a&nbsp;way to have fun but to help people.</p><p>Once I hit the 7th grade I started volunteering on my own, mainly with my school. My best friend Justin and I were the tech leads in our student council at OLQP. Every day we&rsquo;d volunteer our lunch hours and spare time where we ran our school We Day Program, built a school in Haiti and much more. I am proud to say we ended up raising over 10 000 dollars as a student council to build a school. Because of my volunteering at school I was nominated for the Junior Leaders of Tomorrow Award by my Vice Principal.</p><p>My family and I were invited to the Propellus Gala dinner where I was recognized for my&nbsp;volunteering. The part I remember most about the evening was meeting fellow award winners&nbsp;and hearing their volunteer story. And how it felt to tell my own.</p><p>Only until recently has volunteering for me turned into helping people while&nbsp;having fun - instead of having fun while helping people. Even if the difference between the two may&nbsp;seem small, it is actually massive and here is why.</p><p>When a person is having fun while helping people; they are volunteering to have fun and they&nbsp;just end up helping and it&rsquo;s as simple as that.&nbsp;But when a person realizes that they can actually help people while having fun, they will find&nbsp;the true meaning of volunteering.</p><p>----&nbsp;</p><p>Volunteers are needed in every community in an informal capacity, like helping your neighbours, and formal capacities to keep organizations up and running. According to the City of Airdrie&rsquo;s Social Needs Assessment survey in 2014, only 32% of Airdrians currently volunteer, compared to 47% nationally and 55% provincially.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"	"public://org_profile/VAatAirdrieFest 2.jpg"	"3 people pictured in front of Airdrie 3-fold banner"	"Volunteers are needed in every community"	"<p>We promote lifelong volunteerism, raise awareness of the power of service, educate, and inform people about opportunities to serve through volunteerism.

I learned how to take charge of my situation and reach a place of peace and acceptance out of hopelessness... I cannot express in mere words how much this means to me. It has meant my life.&rdquo;</em></p><p>A cancer diagnosis can be devastating. It brings countless life-altering moments and events for people who receive the diagnosis and for those who love them. People with cancer are compelled to find a new &lsquo;normal&rsquo; before, during, and after treatment. Priorities shift, relationships change, life is... different.</p><p>At Wellspring, people living with cancer tell us what helps them the most - having access to information, receiving support, and learning new ways to cope. They also tell us the cancer journey has two roads: medical and emotional.</p><p>Albertans have excellent medical resources to fight cancer, but people who have cancer need so much more than medical care. Individuals and their loved ones often have difficulty finding the emotional, psychological and practical support they so urgently require.</p><p>In Calgary, only Wellspring devotes itself exclusively to the unique non-medical needs that cancer presents. The Wellspring Calgary community of support provides a vital complement to medical treatment. Wellspring helps heal the body, mind, and spirit. It is a place where people with cancer, their families and friends can exchange information, develop a support system and create a sense of hope, in a warm, caring and welcoming atmosphere.</p><p>The beautiful, uplifting surroundings make Wellspring Calgary accessible and extraordinary.&nbsp; Programs and services take place at two locations. &nbsp;In the north, Carma House, a warm and welcoming 4500 square foot home, nestled in trees on a lot meters from the Bow River. Large windows provide views of hills across the water and tranquil woods, and it is minutes from the walking paths by the river. In October 2016, a second leased location opened behind the Blackfoot Inn. Ample parking and a welcoming environment provide easier access to the same programs for those living in south Calgary and area.</p><p>Wellspring charges no fees. Programs are available free to anyone coping with any type of cancer at any stage. Programs include individual and group support, coping skills, expressive therapies, energy work, educational workshops and presentations. A lending resource library provides a range of information on the social, emotional and psychological aspects of cancer.</p><p>Wellspring receives no core government or United Way funding. Programs and operations are made possible through the generous donations of our community.</p><p><strong>To understand how our programs make a difference - see some of Wellspring member&#39;s comments on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7-cBm-QwFdJOUxJ3U8A79g"" target=""_blank"">our YOUTUBE channel.</a></strong></p>"	"public://org_profile/Wellspring CKC_1.jpg"	"At Wellspring, you are not alone..."	"At Wellspring, you are not alone..."	"<p>OUR MISSION | Wellspring Calgary is a warm and welcoming community that provides a comprehensive range of support, resources and programs so anyone living with cancer and the people who care about them can improve the quality of their lives.</p><p>OUR VISION | No one has to face cancer alone.</p><p>Wellspring Calgary addresses the body-mind-spirit needs that result from a cancer diagnosis and its treatment. For those diagnosed, their caregivers and loved ones. We provide over 26,000 hours of program delivery and resources annually at no charge to our members. We currently have a membership of over 4,000 people, welcoming over 500 people annually through our doors. We are supported by 175 volunteers who donate over 10,000 hours of volunteer time annually.</p><p>OUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS | The Calgary Stampede Western Legacy Awards recognized Wellspring Calgary founders for Innovation (<a href=""http://www2.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/story.html?id=71bc6d15-a7e5-4b6e-815f-acd0f6a5cfa4"" target=""_blank"">see story from Calgary Herald</a>). This award recognizes a person or group creating a single visionary project that speaks to western values. We are included in the orientation at Tom Baker Cancer Centre for those newly diagnosed.</p><p>WHAT WE DO | Wellspring Calgary is a unique resource that responds to a specific, recognized and growing need which had been unmet until we opened our doors:&nbsp; the need for resources and support that address the social, emotional and other practical needs people face when they are living with cancer.&nbsp; Helping people live as well as possible with cancer and respond to life&rsquo;s challenges is what Wellspring Calgary does best.&nbsp; Staff, facilitators and volunteers understand the social, emotional and practical consequences of cancer and its treatments on those diagnosed and those who love them.&nbsp; Wellspring has a distinctive approach to the overall support of individuals: helping people to restore the dignity and control they so often lose when faced with a cancer diagnosis, offering a community of support, a safe place where people can connect with others who understand this journey.&nbsp;</p><p><em>&ldquo;Patients for whom emotional distress remains unresolved are five times more likely to use community health services, twice as likely to visit emergency departments, more likely to receive expensive third- and fourth-line chemotherapy and place higher demands on scarce provider time. Emotional and psychological support programs save healthcare resources.&rdquo; &nbsp;</em><em>[Dr. Margaret Fitch, head, Oncology Nursing and Supportive Care, Odette cancer Centre, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. &ldquo; Supportive Care Rebalancing Efforts&rdquo; pp 144-145.]</em></p><p>WHAT IS NEEDED | We know that our current medical system cannot support all needs of all people currently living with cancer. One in two Albertans will face cancer in their lifetime; of the two, the other one will be supporting the one diagnosed, so both will be &ldquo;living with&rdquo; cancer.

After seeing the positive changes in their two children, the family felt compelled to write the following letter.</p><p>I am writing to you regarding your summer camp programs and your ski and snowboard lessons. This letter should have come last season, but nevertheless, I feel even more compelled to write this after my children&rsquo;s experience this year at their summer camps. My kids have participated in many activities and programs at WinSport over the past few years.</p><p>They&rsquo;ve taken skating lessons and ski/snowboard lessons and during the summer months and participated in your mountain bike camps, sport &amp; adventure camps and a hockey camp. Every single camp has been exceptional! My kids come home tired (which is a good thing) and happy. They talk about all the exciting things they&rsquo;ve done throughout the day and how great all of their instructors/leaders have been. My children have had so many leaders and instructors at WinSport that have made such an impact on their love of sport and their desire to try new things. My son cannot wait for winter to come so he can do another snowboard lesson! My daughter is sad that her summer camp is over and can&rsquo;t wait until next summer! For this reason, I must mention some of the amazing staff you have employed.</p><p>My daughter, Paige, had amazing bike camp instructors over the past two years who had such an impact on Paige. Paige&rsquo;s confidence soared and the instructor was so much fun for the girls in her group. Paige also had a wonderful caring leader in her Sport &amp; Adventure camp this year &ndash; her name is Alicia.</p><p>My daughter told me today that the worst part about her camp ending was leaving Alicia! This speaks volumes! Carson was my son&rsquo;s snowboard instructor last year. Zach, my son, took level 1 and 2 preschool snowboard lessons. Now, he can&rsquo;t get enough of it! He still often talks about Carson and hopes that he gets him this season for level 3. Carson was an amazing role model for my son. He instilled such a love of the sport and we couldn&rsquo;t thank him enough! This summer, Zach had a wonderful biking camp leader who was so patient and caring. He built up Zach&rsquo;s confidence and because of that, my son now also has a love for biking.</p><p>I just wanted to let you know that we are so happy with your facility, programs and staff. You have a first class facility and we absolutely enjoy every moment experiencing it. I want to thank your staff that my children had an amazing time this summer and that they can&rsquo;t wait to come back and take part in many other programs.</p>"	"public://org_profile/Winsport_SkiSchool-0521.jpg"	""	"WinSport's Ski and Snowboard School"	"<p>The dictionary defines perseverance as steadfastness in doing something despite difficulty or delay in achieving success. Our team at WinSport helps people pick themselves up after they fall or helps build their confidence after they finish in fourth place &ndash; all so they learn to persevere. This allows them to gain mastery, improve confidence and establish enduring friendships through sport. It also allows them to simply enjoy the benefits of the changing seasons and amazing geography that surrounds us. We believe in being better than yesterday.</p><p>It started for us in the early 1960s. The community gathered on our small hill to strap on planks of wood to learn how to ski and take advantage of the Rocky Mountains in our own backyard. Even back then, among the falls and tumbles, you could hear the laughter and the distinctive slap of a high five when the young and young at heart got up on their skis for the first time or mastered their parallel turns. The willingness to get up and try again is what defines us as Calgarians. As the hill started to grow up, a group of leaders passionate about sport got together with the ambition to put our hill on the world stage by bidding to host the Winter Olympic Games. After a few failed attempts, these leaders dusted themselves off and eventually won the bid to welcome the world to our small ski hill in 1988. These Games were filled with stories of challenge and perseverance, such as Eddie the Eagle soaring to new heights or the fledgling Jamaican bobsleigh team, who after flipping their sled in the Kreisel, persevered to the finish line to cap off an amazing run at their first ever Winter Olympic Games.</p><p>These stories of pushing to be better, despite not hitting the podium yet achieving so much, galvanized our purpose here at WinSport. We are here to help people activate and reach their potential through the spirit of sport. Since that time, our organization and our campus have grown. Through continued investment and our push to be better, we are focused on developing the whole person. This does not simply mean mastering sport &ndash; it means simultaneously building the mental, physical and social skills of our participants. Through our experience, there is lot to be learned from trying something new &ndash; failing and trying again, or achieving a personal best. We have introduced people to sport across our campus and have provided the guidance and abilities to push them to their personal podiums across the globe. Many see it as a ski lesson, skate lesson or a week of summer camp. We see it as an opportunity to instil valuable life skills to enable people to have a positive impact on their family, friends and the community as a whole. At WinSport, we believe we are here to teach others how they can be better than yesterday.</p><p><strong>A Year in Review - In 2015, WinSport:</strong></p><ul><li>introduced more than 30,000 people to sport through ski and snowboard lessons, summer camps, mountain bike camps and hockey, ringette and learn to skate camps (including visits by more than 20,000 school kids from 150 different schools);</li><li>was able to secure one of the top chefs in Western Canada, with the addition of Liana Robberecht as the organization&rsquo;s new executive chef; and</li><li>continued to be a key driver for physical literacy in the sport community through our Active Lives department.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>"	"public://org_profile/Winsport_SummerCamp-9376.jpg"	""	"WinSport Summer Camp"	"<p>As an Olympic venue that operates year round, we are able to offer an eclectic array of activities, programming, camps and lessons in which 1.2 million Calgarians participate in each year.

She was struggling to build a career in a new country where she had little work experience. She also lacked the computer skills necessary for many jobs. And without a stable income, she found herself without access to many of the basic needs items we all need to feel stable, secure and confident.&nbsp;</p><p>Winnie stopped by the Erin Woods Family Resource Centre in the hopes of making improvements in her life. She wanted to find a job and learn about resources available in her community. She also wanted to make positive changes for herself, her family and her neighbourhood.</p><p>Through WINS, Winnie received a Free Goods Referral for free clothing from our thrift stores, help with her resume, access to computer courses, and assistance applying for jobs. Her WINS Family Resource Centre Facilitator, Nadima, even helped her get a washer and dryer for her home. According to Winnie, every problem she came to WINS with, she was able to get help finding solutions.</p><p><em><strong>&ldquo;I feel safe and happy knowing that there is an office in my neighborhood that if I ever have any problem I can go to Nadima and talk to her and get help.&rdquo;</strong></em></p><p>Winnie soon began volunteering with WINS as she continued working to gain more job skills training. &ldquo;I want to encourage and support other women.

"<p>In the mid-80&rsquo;s, Catherine Tkach was living in a rehabilitation facility after having survived years in an abusive relationship and struggling with an addiction as a result. She needed clothing and all that was available was dirty and sitting in garbage bags in a basement room. Catherine knew then what she wanted to do with her life: create a space where women who were struggling could get what they needed in an environment where they had dignity and choice. Thus, the Women In Need Society (WINS) was born.</p><p>Today, our stores serve Calgarians at all socio-economic levels and fund 85 per cent of our programs available to women in need and their families. Partnering with more than 80 Calgary agencies, we provide marginalized women and their families with access to free basic need items, skill-building, social and goal based programs. We also partner with local agencies to offer entry level employment opportunities for those new to Canada, those needing work experience and those struggling to find employment elsewhere.&nbsp;</p><p>As Calgary faces a declining economic climate, the reality is that:</p><ul><li>One in 10 of our neighbours live in poverty</li><li>One in five are children under the age of five</li><li>A single mother, employed full-time earning minimum wage with a three-year-old child experiences a monthly deficit of $203.00 and an annual deficit of $2,436.00</li><li>70 per cent of families earning less than $30,000 annually worry about their ability to afford basic needs</li><li>21,000 children under the age of 18 are living in low-income households</li><li>68.8 per cent of low-wage workers 26 years or older are women</li></ul><p>WINS understands that in order to break cycles of poverty, people need access to the basic needs required to provide for their families as well as access to the social networks so crucial for maintaining mental and physical health. That&#39;s why our programs and services are constantly evolving.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the past several years, we&#39;ve seen an increased demand for our programs and services. To meet the increasing need, we opened three additional Family Resource Centre locations and expanded our Free Goods Referral Program to include free delivery of furniture and large household items to the women we serve.</p><p>In 2016 alone, over $624,000 in Free Goods Referrals were issued to women in need and their families and more than&nbsp;13,000 adults and&nbsp;5,000 children received critical support through WINS programs at our Family Resource Centres.

Referrals include, but are not limited to food, clothing, furniture, housing, utilities, haircuts, and education and employment assistance.</p><p><strong>Computer and Technology Access&nbsp;</strong>| We provide women with free access to computers with internet, a photocopier, a fax machine, and telephones. Women use this equipment to prepare for work opportunities, to complete schoolwork and to stay connected with family and friends. We also provide a mail service for women without permanent mailing addresses and take telephone messages for women.</p><p><strong>Girl Power Programming</strong> | The Women&rsquo;s Centre offers Girl Power Camps in the spring and summer to mentor young girls (10-12) and promote basic values of equality, self-determination and empowerment. There is also an after school program on Tuesdays and Thursdays for girls 10-13 years old. The programs are free of charge with expenses such as transportation, meals, and supplies covered by the Centre.</p><p><strong>Legal Advice &amp; Tax Clinics</strong>&nbsp;| Volunteers provide free legal advice and income tax clinics for women. Our legal advice clinics are aimed at providing women with the preliminary information and support they may need to access the legal system in the areas of family and non-family law. Volunteers who prepare taxes for women also provide information on how to access benefits such as GST rebates, Canada child tax benefit and provincial child benefits.</p><p><strong>Peer Support</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>| Trained volunteers help women by listening, exploring options and providing non-therapeutic support, unique to each woman and circumstance. We also provide safety planning with women in potentially dangerous situations and we work with other agencies addressing violence.</p><p><strong>Social Issues Work</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>| In addition to helping women meet their basic needs and create community, we strive to give all women opportunities to get involved in social justice issues and have a voice in public policy.</p><p><strong>Workshops &amp; Groups</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>| Every year, we offer more than 200 free informal adult education sessions ranging in topics from computer skills, yoga, parenting, and self-defense to international women&rsquo;s issues, crafts, stress management, and self-esteem. Ongoing groups include Practice English and a community group for women with developmental disabilities.&nbsp;</p>"	"public://profiles/HOW - Speak Out Pride Parade.jpg"	"Marching at the Pride Parade"	"Speak Out Pride Parade"	"<p>There are so many ways you can get involved at the Women&rsquo;s Centre.</p><p><strong>Volunteering</strong>&nbsp;| We count on over 750 active volunteers for everything from peer support, to food day set-up, to taxes and legal advice.

"772"	"Wood's Homes"	"25"	"<p>What do you think of when you hear &ldquo;Street Services&rdquo;? Do you picture a shelter and people handing out steaming bowls of soup and cosy mittens in the winter?</p><p>I&rsquo;d like to share Jack&rsquo;s story with you, and you&rsquo;ll see that Street Services can and should be so much more.</p><p>As a young boy, Jack watched as gambling and alcohol addictions consumed his father, Tim, whom he idolized and adored. His mother suffered years of emotional and physical abuse and finally found the courage to leave when Jack was 14, taking them far away to be sure Tim wouldn&rsquo;t follow.</p><p>His mom, Leanne, had a hard time finding stable work, so they struggled with daily life in a tough neighbourhood in this city where they had no family or friends to fall back on.</p><p>And then &ndash; just when they thought things couldn&rsquo;t get much worse, Leanne was diagnosed with lung cancer. Jack met a social worker during one of his daily visits to the hospital, but she could only offer a bus pass and a single food hamper during the 6 weeks before Leanne passed away. They had no savings, no life insurance, and the rent was overdue.</p><p>Jack had nowhere to go, and no one to help him.</p><p>He slept in stairways or in bushes; he found a blanket and camped close to others on the street. The constant pain of grief and despair Jack felt was dulled a little by the drugs someone offered him.</p><p>Young people like Jack come to us at Wood&rsquo;s Homes every day. They text us saying they are anxious and afraid...they walk through our doors at the Eastside Family Centre or EXIT Community Outreach hoping someone will listen...they are referred to one of our specialized programs after a crisis like a suicide attempt &ndash; thousands of children and teens over the course of a single year.</p><p>Jack finally came to Wood&rsquo;s, too. He lined up with a few others outside the EXIT Community Outreach doors on a bitterly cold morning, slipped into a chair in the corner and put his head down.</p><p>I sat down next to him and told him my name was Patrick. I saw how scared he was to be there, and how utterly alone he felt.</p><p>I offered him something to eat. Ducking his head, Jack quietly said, &ldquo;Yes, please.&rdquo;</p><p>This is what we all think of, right? That those who are homeless come looking for a warm place to rest their head and some food to stave off the hunger?</p><p>Jack did start off looking for food and warmth, and found that he could do laundry, have a shower, eat, and even get some warm socks. Wood&rsquo;s Street Services offers these things because no one can ever heal if their basic needs are not met.</p><p>But then, as Jack started to trust us, he also started to trust himself again. When I asked him if he might like to volunteer at one of our luncheons, he said he would.</p><p>While we prepped for this lunch with some of the other volunteers who help out, Jack talked quietly about how his mom taught him to cook. Later, while he helped me serve the food he prepared, I saw a light in his eyes for the first time.</p><p>Now it was time to ask Jack a question. Street Services at Wood&rsquo;s isn&rsquo;t just about providing food and shelter &ndash; we <strong>are</strong> a mental health organization, after all. Our Street Services include counsellors, clinicians, job training, transitional housing, and all the advantages of having great relationships with other organizations.</p><p>So&hellip;the question. I asked if he might be interested in becoming a chef one day.</p><p>Fear and excitement flashed in equal measure across his face. I could tell that he really wanted to say yes, so I reminded him that if he wanted to try, he wouldn&rsquo;t have to do it alone.</p><p>Jack began his training in the culinary program with such hope, but then fell into a deep depression. Cooking reminded him so much of his mother, and how much he missed her.</p><p>The Wood&rsquo;s Youth Culinary Arts Program (YCAP) is special because it doesn&rsquo;t just get youth ready to work; it includes ongoing support from counsellors and access to clinicians. Jack was able to attend weekly therapy sessions to work through his grief, trauma and addiction while completing his training.</p><p>The next time Jack came in to share what he cooked at the YCAP kitchen, we set up a meeting for him so he could look into finding a place to live. All this time he&rsquo;d still been sleeping on the streets, but now he was clean and working steadily at a restaurant downtown.</p><p>He invited me to come with him when he got the keys to his apartment. When we got to the building, he gave me a hug, asked me to wait in the hall for a minute, and opened the door.</p><p>He told me later that when he went out onto the balcony he said out loud: &ldquo;Mom, I did it. I have a job now. I have a home. And I feel like I might have me back, too.&rdquo;</p>"	"public://org_profile/Boy at brick wall_Smaller_0.jpg"	"Jack Spring 2017"	"Jack, 2017"	"<div><strong>We Never Say No. We Never Give Up.&nbsp;<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We Never Turn Anyone Away.</span></strong></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>We offer services to children and their families in Calgary, Lethbridge, Strathmore, Canmore, Fort McMurray and Fort Smith, N.W.T.

"510"	"Wordfest"	"25"	"<p>&quot;Wordfest was a fantastic way to get our students pumped about reading at the beginning of the year. After reading The Metro Dogs of Moscow by Rachelle Delaney and priming our students to meet the author, they were more excited than ever to participate in this field trip. It has made a lasting effect on the rest of the year, as the students are now eager to read and engage more meaningfully with text!&quot;<em>&ndash; Gabby Calder &ndash; Teacher</em></p><p>&quot;As an emerging Western Canadian writer, the Festival launched me into a prominence for which I could have only hoped and wished. Your Festival and its hard work to involve local and provincial media in coverage of local and out-of-town writers translated in my case into a nationally syndicated feature which appeared in major daily papers in nearly every large urban market. It would not have happened without the dedication and openness to new writers at WordFest&quot;<em>&mdash; JJ Lee, Wordfest 2011 Alumnus</em></p><p>HISTORY&nbsp;| THE INITIAL SEED FOR WORDFEST WAS PLANTED IN 1995&nbsp;when The Banff Centre, interested in profiling its Writing and Publishing programs, sponsored the Hospitality Suite at The Vancouver International Writers Festival. Don Stein, then Associate Director, Planning for The Banff Centre, established a relationship with the Writers Guild of Alberta and a number of other interested parties, to explore the realities of establishing a Banff-Calgary International Writers Festival.</p><p>Wordfest was established in 1996 as a project of The Banff Centre, Calgary Public Library, Mount Royal University and The Writers Guild of Alberta. The Banff Centre then approached respected arts professional Anne Green to develop the Festival and create an independent entity. The annual Festival would take place in October and feature international, national and local writers.&nbsp;Founding Festival Director <strong>Anne Green</strong>&nbsp;programmed the first Wordfest, featuring 50 writers and two dozen events, taking place over four days. The 1996 line-up featured Margaret Atwood, Roch Carrier, Wayson Choy, Tomson Highway, Paul Quarrington and Sheri-D Wilson.</p><p>Since then, Wordfest has presented many notable and world-renowned writers, such as Martin Amis, Margaret Atwood, Louis de Bernières, Joseph Boyden, Eleanor Catton, Wayson Choy, Douglas Coupland, Roddy Doyle, Richard Ford, Diana Gabaldon, Rawi Hage, Tomson Highway, Lawrence Hill, Nancy Huston, John Irving, Barbara Kingsolver, Dany Laferrière, Alexander McCall Smith, Annie Proulx, Mordecai Richler and David Suzuki.</p><p>In 2010, Founding Festival Director Anne Green introduced Festival audiences to incoming Director Jo Steffens. While honoring the mandate of the Festival and continuing its legacy, Executive Director Jo Steffens launched new programming elements that encourage audiences to think differently about the literary landscape.</p><p>Wordfest has recently presented writers in unscripted storytelling events; film and short-animation screenings about books and literary topics; curated presentations of essays inspired by online videos; live illustrations; and friendly competitions in which writers improvise a performance of their writing on-stage. These program innovations and others are designed to broaden the audience for the Festival and to foster an appreciation of the variety of forms in which the literary arts can be<br />experienced.</p><p>April 2015, the Board of Directors of Wordfest announced Shelley Youngblut as the new General Director, to guide Wordfest through its 20th anniversary celebrations and into the Festival&#39;s third decade. Youngblut&#39;s dedication to fostering a generous, inclusive approach to arts presentation at Wordfest marshalled wide community support, inspired audiences and energized volunteers in the creation of a lively, public celebration of 20 years as the region&#39;s premier international readers and writers Festival.</p><p>A strong advocate for high-quality community engagement, Youngblut comes to Wordfest from her previous positions as Western Editor of the <em>Globe and Mail</em> and founding editor of <em>SWERVE</em>, the <em>Calgary Herald&rsquo;s</em> award-winning weekly magazine. A well-known, &ldquo;creative ringleader,&rdquo; she is a regular member of the <em>Unconventional Panel</em> on <em>CBC Calgary&sbquo; The Eyeopener</em>, and recently curated the photography exhibit, <em>Your Town is Our Town</em>, at the Lougheed House Gallery. Youngblut is a past participant of <em>The Banff Centre&sbquo; Literary Journalism, Wired Writing Studio</em> and <em>Arts Journalism</em> programs, as well as the Stanford Professional Publishing Program.</p>"	"public://org_profile/22705684288_3b7dca1a63_z-CKC.jpg"	"Wordfest 2015 - Canadian Edge event"	"Wordfest 2015 - Calgary artist Janine Vangool w/ Canadian writers Zsuzsi Gartner, Michael Hingston and Neil Smith"	"<p>Wordfest sparks lively, illuminating and meaningful conversations between Calgary&rsquo;s readers and the world&rsquo;s most engaging writers.

Due perhaps in part to the recent presentation of the findings of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada and the launch of the national inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, we strongly perceive an unprecedented eagerness for understanding and connection with Indigenous communities through inspiring and informative live-audience presentations. Wordfest looks forward to renewing the expansion of its Indigenous Voices programming that began in 2015.</p><p><strong>New Focus on making Calgary THE Readers City</strong></p><p>Calgary is beyond ready to offer a yearly destination weekend, in which readers can engage with a major literary figure.

Or for that matter, not just the road, but the lands and waters of two Canadian provinces, three US states, numerous First Nations territories and countless private lands?</p><p>Not everyone can tell their own story. But mapping the travels of a 5-year-old female grey wolf named Pluie helped to change our perspective on, and the face of, conservation.</p><p>On a rainy June day in 1991, researchers in Kananaskis Country, Alberta, fitted Pluie with a radio-collar that went on to track her astonishing 100,000-square kilometre journey &ndash; more than 15 times the area of Banff National Park - over the next two years. Seeking out food and mates and trying to avoid the threats of civilization took her through Banff to British Columbia, and as far south as Montana, Idaho and Washington in the US.</p><p>It was <a href=""http://y2y.net/vision/y2y-the-geography-of-hope/wildlifes-need-to-roam?searchterm=pluie"" target=""_blank"">journeys like Pluie&rsquo;s</a>, and the growing scientific understanding that conservation needed to happen at a broader, transboundary scale &ndash; the scale at which animals use the landscape - that inspired conservationist and Y2Y founder Harvey Locke to first write the words &ldquo;Yellowstone to Yukon&rdquo; on a map in 1993.</p><p>Scientists were finding that a whole range of species, from wolves to grizzly bears to fish and birds, were becoming isolated in protected &lsquo;pockets&rsquo; and struggling to migrate from one area to the next. This affected their ability to support themselves, to reproduce and to adapt to a changing landscape and climate. And that in turn was impacting not just their survival, but the balance of the whole ecosystem that they interacted with.</p><p>The realization heralded the start of the collaborative Y2Y vision of an interconnected network of wild lands and waters in one of the world&rsquo;s last remaining intact mountain ecosystems. That vision includes protecting not only the space needed for wildlife to roam, but clean air, clean water, and the integrity of the places we love to recreate in. For more than 20 years, Y2Y and its partners have been working hard and creatively to turn the vision into a reality.</p><p>And for more than 20 years, Y2Y has been bringing together the people, ideas and resources to make the connections that will ensure that animals like Pluie, as well as our own children and grandchildren, will be able to live and thrive with one another in harmony.</p>"	"public://org_profile/Dav Martinson_Kakwa Provincial Park.jpg"	"Iconic landscape in the Yellowstone to Yukon region"	"We connect and protect iconic landscapes and wildlife - Photo Credit: Dav Martinson"	"<p>Y2Y is the only organization dedicated to securing the long-term ecological health of the Yellowstone to Yukon region. We work with over 300 diverse partners to protect and connect natural habitat across the 3200km of wild lands and waters - which has Alberta and the Rockies at its heart - and to ensure that people and wildlife can live together in harmony and thrive.</p><p>The region is a special place - home to the full suite of wildlife that was present when Europeans first arrived in North America; and the source of 13 major rivers, which provide clean, safe drinking water for more than 15 million people. It needs our best efforts, working together, to protect it.</p><p>We take action - locally, regionally and internationally - to safeguard the clean water, pure air, rich forests and iconic wildlife that are at risk. We bring together the right people in the right places to develop and implement regional, scientifically-grounded conservation solutions at the right time.

We lead efforts to protect wild lands and waters throughout this region, but we also carry out, coordinate and support numerous projects that help animals to survive and thrive in the spaces between protected areas, and to safeguard them as they move from one area to the next.</p><p>We use eight key strategies:</p><p>1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Private Lands &ndash; working with willing property owners to secure and protect private lands that help maintain key wildlife corridors and habitat.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Protected Areas and Public Lands&ndash; identifying wildlife habitat that is at risk from development and find ways to protect it, such as helping to create new parks.</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Policy &ndash; helping to shape and create policies and practices that support our vision.</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transportation &ndash; working to make busy roads (like the TransCanada Highway and Highway 3) safer for humans and wildlife, for example by installing fencing and crossings.</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Co-existence - supporting education and outreach programs and tools that help people share space with wildlife.</p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appropriate Development - supporting development that is consistent with our vision, and speaking out if it brings more damage than benefit.</p><p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Habitat Restoration &ndash; working to heal damaged forests and streams in key wildlife areas.</p><p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Promoting the Vision - promoting a connected landscape through our ever-growing networks and diverse businesses, scientists, non-profit groups and local communities.</p><p>Several of our more local initiatives are outlined here, and many more can be found <a href=""http://y2y.net/work/what-hot-projects"" target=""_blank"">on our website</a>.</p><p><strong>I. Protecting Alberta Headwaters</strong></p><p>Alberta&rsquo;s mountain headwaters supply fresh water to millions of Albertans, provide key ecosystem services such as flood and drought control, support habitat that is home to wildlife including iconic grizzlies, wolverines and caribou, and offer year-round, awe-inspiring recreational opportunities.</p><p>Y2Y has been leading conservation partners, outdoors groups, industry, local businesses and government agencies in efforts to safeguard our headwaters from inadequate protection and management, industrial development and over-use. Recent climatic conditions and events have reflected just how important it is that we find better ways to look after our watersheds.&nbsp;<a href=""http://y2y.net/work/what-hot-projects/alberta-headwaters"" target=""_blank"">Find out more...</a></p><p><strong>II. Reducing Wildlife/Vehicle Collisions</strong></p><p>Highways fragment wildlife habitat throughout the Y2Y region and can be major barriers to connectivity and survival. Not only are animals (and of course humans) killed or injured through collisions, but highways can block or deter them from moving to find food, mates and new or seasonal habitat.</p><p>Highway 3 is just one of the busy highways that Y2Y is working to mitigate the impacts of. This east-west route south of Calgary helps up to 9,000 vehicles a day cut across the Rocky Mountains. The road also bisects an area of prime wildlife habitat, which is part of a north-south wildlife movement corridor for some of the region&rsquo;s most iconic species, such as grizzly bears, wolverines, cougars and bighorn mountain sheep. There is nothing to help them negotiate the trucks, cars and motorbikes that thunder along, and frequent wildlife/vehicle collisions are taking a heavy toll on both humans and animals.</p><p>Y2Y is supporting Alberta initiatives around Crowsnest Pass and Rock Creek to help wildlife cross the road safely and to warn drivers of the dangers.&nbsp;<a href=""http://y2y.net/work/what-hot-projects/making_highway_3_wildlife-friendly"" target=""_blank"">Find out more...</a></p><p><strong>III. Supporting Cutting-Edge Climate Change Programs</strong></p><p>The &lsquo;Crown of the Continent&rsquo; is one of the largest and most intact natural ecosystems in North America, and incorporates many of Calgarians&rsquo; beloved &lsquo;back-yard&rsquo; recreational areas. The Crown of the Continent Conservation Initiative (CCCI) is a partnership between 14 leading conservation organizations, hosted by Y2Y, who work together on progressive, scientifically-based, large-landscape conservation and connectivity, through a climate change lens. CCCI also engages with community members, tribes and government agencies.</p><p>Having identified gaps in our approach to conservation through a comprehensive &lsquo;Climate Impacts Assessment&rsquo;, CCCI is now forging ahead with on-the-ground projects to support the resilience of our water sources, lands and wildlife in the face of changing environmental conditions.&nbsp;<a href=""http://y2y.net/work/where-by-region/crown-of-the-continent"" target=""_blank"">Find out more...</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>"	"public://profiles/Northern Focus Creative_Bighorn Sheep on Road.jpg"	"Sheep along highway in front of truck"	"Our work includes reducing wildlife/vehicle collisions along highways - Photo Credit: Northern Focus Creative"	"<p>Be a part of the Y2Y vision and help protect and connect this iconic region and its wildlife forever!

We were so excited to get back. We always felt welcomed and cared for at the YMCA and my children had so much fun.</em></p><p><em>But life kept getting harder, my daughter was diagnosed with juvenile arthritis, my twenty year marriage ended, my gym bag was stolen and I had a medical emergency while exercising at the YMCA that resulted in an ambulance ride and seven hours at the hospital.</em></p><p><em>Through all of this, the YMCA has been there for my family. They noticed when I wasn&#39;t there and invited me back. When my gym bag was stolen, Christy and Nancy gave me a new gym bag and a gift certificate to buy new workout clothes.

A place where Calgary&rsquo;s youth have access to the resources they need to help them navigate life&rsquo;s tough situations and help them make the right decisions.</p><p>At YouthLink, students are exposed to real life stories of bullies, their victims and bystanders.
