"2",251,"Adoption Options Alberta Ltd.","At 14, Stephanie discovered she was pregnant ...I was a typical teenager. I was responsible, did excellent in school, had lots of friends and was extremely athletic. But when I stopped dancing, I lost my goals and my friends. My sisters drug addiction started destroying my family, and my parents put all their energy into helping her. I felt completely lost and all alone.Then everything changed. I was no longer alone. I was pregnant.I loved my baby more than words could ever describe. But what was I going to do? Abortion was out of the question, and my parents were clear they definitely would not help raise my child. Sadly, I knew that at 14, I had nothing to give him but love.I searched the internet and found Adoption Options and got counseling. I read letters and profiles for hours and hours but none of them felt right. None of them. Then I got to the very last letter, and I knew Id found my adoptive family. Jean and Chris were the ones I wanted to be my babys parents.Jean and Chris struggled for years with infertility. Then they struggled to find a new-normal life after their angel Gabriel died in their arms less than two hours after he was born. When they wrote the Dear Birthmother letter that Stephanie read, it came from the depths of their hearts, and spoke of love and loss and their longing for a family created through adoption.Liam was born a few days later, and I placed my precious baby in the arms of someone else. This was the hardest and most painful thing I have ever done. Its because I loved my son so much that I knew this was the right decision.After the adoption, I finished high school with my friends. It wasnt easy because I had grown up so much with what I went through, and because I missed my baby so much. But I visited him lots, and Jean sent me pictures all the time. My family and his family are really close.I know now that in an open adoption you do not lose a child but you gain a family.Im in college and working towards my accounting degree now.I still think about Liam every day, but now that hes older we talk on the phone and text regularly.Hes an amazing kid! And I love watching him play hockey - his total passion! Knowing Liam and being a part of his life is important to me because it validates that I made the right choice. Watching him grow and flourish gives me strength and makes me so proud to be his birthmother.- StephanieAdoption Options exists for women like Stephanie, couples like Jean and Chris, and children like Liam.","Adoption Options has brought together over 1,700 birth and adoptive families to provide forever homes for children since 1985.

The first seems lonely and a little forlorn, looking to remember the adventures and victories of his youth. The second is wide-eyed and excited; she is thrilled to learn about the role played by the men and women of Canadas Air Force.Both love the Air Force Museum for opening their eyes and hearts to both what has gone before and the promise of what lies ahead.No one wants war, especially those who have fought in them; however, the world has been and remains a dangerous place for freedom-loving peoples.The world wants and needs countries like Canada to create the environment for peace and then to help preserve it. Throughout history, Canadians have never shirked the call for help from abroad. This call has come to Canada for two reasons. First, because of our willingness to stand on guard and to take up arms when needed and, even more importantly, because of our demonstrated ability to respect the dignity of others.We want our guests to leave invigorated with knowledge of our military accomplishments and an appreciation of the fact that peace is not just the absence of war but the protection of hard won freedoms.","The purpose of the Air Force Museum Society of Alberta is to promote an awareness of the significant contributions made by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) to our country, province and community, with an emphasis on:Air Force establishments in Alberta;distinguished Air Force personnel;artifactsrelated to the history, customs and traditions of the Royal Canadian Air Forcethehistory of the Royal Canadian Air Cadet League of CanadaThe Museum, supported by theSociety, shall procure, restore, preserve and exhibit artifacts of Air Forcehistorical significance, in accordance with the collection policy of the Society.

"5",674,"Alberta Animal Rescue Crew Society (AARCS)","It was early December and the weather forecast was calling for a blizzard and freezing temperatures when the phone rang. A concerned citizen had noticed a stray dog on their property had given birth under their shed.Recognizing that the pups wouldnt survive a blizzard, rescuers immediately packed up the truck and made the three-hour drive to a property near Rocky Mountain House.When they arrived they found a very scared momma dog peaking her head out from under the shed. Skinny and terrified she was doing her best to keep her six puppies warm and fed. The rescuers tried to coax her close enough to get a leash around her head, but she was too smart and quick. Four puppies came out from under the shed to see what was going on and rescuers quickly scooped them up. They were placed in a basket filled with blankets and put in the warm truck. The remaining two puppies were wary just like their momma.The wind was blowing and the snow was starting to come down, the storm was fast approaching. Rescuers tried everything to encourage the dogs to come out on their own but with no luck. Finally, with just enough space, rescuers crawled on their stomach under the shed. They were able to get a leash around mommas neck and pull her out along with the remaining pups. They were all placed in the warm truck for the ride to a foster home.To our surprise momma dog (whom we named Maya) crawled up, laid her head on her rescuers lap, closed her eyes and fell fast asleep. She and her little family of six were finally safe. Its like she knew everything was going to be OK.The trip home took almost 5 hours due to increasingly bad road conditions. When the family arrived Maya was given a big bowl of food and water and her and her puppies a warm, safe bed.The blizzard came in full force and lasted five days, without that phone call and the rescue crews quick action these little puppies would have perished in the cold dark of night. Instead Maya and pups are enjoying life in adoptive homes.","AARCS was founded in 2006 by a small group of people who were looking to make a difference in the lives of animals and has grown into a vast network of volunteers, foster homes, and supporters. We now have over 1200 volunteers across the province with our head office in Calgary and a satellite office in Edmonton. Our volunteers range in age from young children to seniors all looking to create a more compassionate world for animals.AARCS began withrescuing and rehominghomeless, abandoned, and surrendered animals and to-date have found new, loving homes for more than 12,000 pets. We knew there would be an endless number of homeless animals if we didnt strive to end animal homelessness at the root of the issue. We needed to share information and help the public understand the value of responsible pet guardianship throughSpay and Neuter Initiativeswhile providing assistance programsto keep pets in their homes whenever possible.In 2012 AARCS opened an animal shelter in Calgary, dubbedSafe Haven, which is designed to provide temporary housing, emergency shelter and quarantine for newly rescued animals. In 2017, AARCS will be moving and expanding operations to a new facility in SE Calgary which will include a 3,000 square foot Veterinary Hospital. This is a big step for AARCS and enhanced the ability to help even more animals. While a shelter is a great tool for initial intake, AARCS remain foster-home based as we believe a home is the best environment for adoptable pets to live while we search for a great adoptive family. The shelter offers temporary holding space and allows for medical and parasite treatment for new arrivals prior to entering volunteer foster homes, as well as a space to temporarily hold owned animals participating in our Spay/Neuter Assistance Program. The shelter is manned by volunteers and is open to our rescued animals 365 days a year.In 2013, AARCS stepped up during the floods in central Alberta helping rescue hundreds of stranded and displaced pets. Recognizing the huge need for emergency response as it relates to humans and their pets, this challenging event prompted the development of ourEmergency/ Disaster Relief Program. In 2016 AARCS Rescue Crews were called in to help rescue thousands of stranded pets during the devestating fires in Fort McMurray.Today AARCS continues to help in almost any situation where pets are in need of assistance. We are a community partner specializing in pets and their people. We continue to share information with the public throughHumane Education and Outreachwhile providing community support programs where needs arise.Every once in awhile people ask me how I can foster. It must be so hard to let them go, they say. Yes it is hard, but so worth it. I love them all and think about them all of the time. But without people who step up to foster, organizations like AARCS couldnt help save these animals. So if you ever thought about fostering, now is the time. As it gets colder, AARCS gets more calls of animals in need and the more foster families they have the more animals we can save!    - Kyle Sommerville, AARCS Foster Parent","AARCS provides numerous community programs across southern Alberta and Calgary to help animals in our community and the animals we share our lives with. These programs include:Rescue, Rehabilitate  Re-home Program: Many of the animals we rescue are sick or injured and require extensive rehabilitation and medical care. We provide all necessary veterinary care, including major surgeries for broken bones, gunshot wounds and other serious traumas, treatment of various skin conditions such as mange and whatever other ailments they may have, along with providing food, rehabilitation, training, kindness and support through our foster home network. All the animals that come through our program are spayed or neutered, vaccinated and treated for parasites prior to adoption.Spay/Neuter  Disease Prevention Initiative: This program offers spay/neuter surgeries for low-income and First Nation pet owners in Alberta. This program gets us one step closer to ending over population of animals in our province. Similarly, we offer TNR (Trap/neuter and return) services. TNR is a method of humanely trapping unaltered feral (wild) cats, spay/neutering the entire population and returning them to the location where they where found to be supported by a caretaker. TNR is considered a humane and more effective alternative to euthanasia for managing and reducing feral cat populations.Emergency and Disaster Response: AARCS highly experienced Disaster Animal Response Team is able to be on the front lines of any disaster or emergency  from floods, to fires, to hoarding or puppy mill seizures. Our volunteers are dedicated to the safety and protection of animals in our community.Humane Education/Outreach Program: AARCS Humane Education Program was created to share information with todays youth on issues related to animal care, behavior and the welfare of all animals. At AARCS we believe that sharing our knowledge, especially with children, is the most fundamental way to build a foundation of compassion towards animals in the communities where we work. We also realize the huge impact animals can have on all members of a community, so have expanded the program to include Outreach to groups of all ages. Assistance Programs: AARCS offers a wide variety of assistance programs that are designed to keep pets in their homes. Whether it be assistance with pet food during financial crisis, assistance with an emergency veterinary bill, a dog house to keep their pets warm or temporary housing for their pets during an emergency we will do whatever we can to try and keep the pets in their homes and out of the shelter.","We all play an important role in the rescue journey of each animal. Whether you volunteer at the shelter, foster in your home, support through spreading the word or become a donor it takes each and every one of us to save a life.Right now, AARCS is seeking help with the Capital Campaign to assist in getting our new facility up and running, which include a 3,000 square foot Veterinary Hopsital.Having a veterinary hospital on-site will give us the ability to help the animals in most dire need of medical attention with an onsite veterinary surgical suite and ability to provide life-saving treatment.AARCS needs to raise $550,000 for this capital project, which includes renovations, build out of the veterinary hospital, additional animal housing, and all the equipment necessary for the veterinary hospital. This strategic move will allow AARCS to improve the facility operations in order to help our community at reduced costs and making our donor dollars go further.DonateWhile we have the manpower, drive and ambition, financial support is essential to fulfill our commitment of care to these animals, not only covering the basic cost of maintaining and cultivating safe and healthy environments, but also to further develop our programs and initiatives. Please consider becomingmonthly donor. Sign up for any monthly amount -- $20, $50, $100 -- directly from your bank account or credit card. While it may not seem like a lot, this reliable and steady input helps us to maintain our programs and ultimately help more animals.SponsorshipFor individuals, families or companies looking to contribute in a unique way, sponsorship just may be the way to go! Your sponsorship includes recognition in unique ways that you can share with family, friends and customers.VolunteerorFoster Our volunteers spend hundreds of hours a month maintaining operations so together we can continue to help more animals in need. Whether you volunteer an hour a week or three hours a day, everyone is needed. Or consider fostering - provide a temporary, safe and loving environment for a homeless pet. By opening your home and heart to a homeless pet YOU will SAVE A LIFE of a homeless pet.NetworkFollow us on social media and share our stories. Encourage people to spay/neuter their pets.

"6",332,"Alberta Cancer Foundation ","Weve all heard the cancer stories, read the stats, and most likely have experienced the impact of cancer up close and personal or with someone we love. In fact, if theres one thing humans across the globe can agree on, its that no one wants to hear the words, you have cancer. So everyone is in favor of better care, facilities and above all else, outcomes. Together with the brightest minds in research and compassionate care, the Alberta Cancer Foundation is making life better for Albertans facing cancer.We stand alongside every Albertan who hears those fateful words you have cancer, by pushing the pace of progress that leads to faster diagnoses, groundbreaking research and leading-edge treatments.We dont do this alone - we bring together donors, patients, healthcare providers and researchers, because we know this is the fastest way to close the gap between diagnosis and cure. We are the official fundraising partner for all 17 cancer centres in Alberta, including the Tom Baker Cancer Centre in Calgary and the Cross Cancer Institute in Edmonton. Through this partnership, we are able to make the most significant impact for patients, right at the point of care.We do not exist to raise moneywe raise money as a means to an end. We invest your money with a clear line of sight to patient outcomes. We invest donor dollars in initiatives that provide real-life returns. We measure the returns on investment in results, outcomes and impacts. Cancer patients returning to their lives. Parents returning to young children. Employees returning to work. People from all over our province returning, in the thousands, to their communities. What greater return on investment could there possibly be?For every Albertan who hears the words you have cancer, we offer three in return -we will help.","Enhancing the lives of patients and their families is the core of everything we do. We believe that in order to create more moments for Albertans, we need to make investments that matterinvestments that will reduce cancer risk, detect cancer earlier, improve quality of life and provide better treatment options. Every investment has a direct line of sight to patients with cancer.Through the generosity and commitment of our donors, we invest in people, ideas and initiatives that push the pace of progress, ignite innovative research, implement leading-edge treatments, and most importantly, provide hope.RETURN ON INVESTMENT: In this years annual report, you will notice we are focused on your investment and your return. It might seem odd for a philanthropic organization to be using language found traditionally in the business world, but we think we owe it to you, our donors, to ensure you are getting the best return on your dollar. In cancer research, we think ROI stands for Results, Outcome and Impacteverything that directly improves patients lives. Think about what might happen if the Alberta Cancer Foundation wasnt here to invest in certain programs.For example, without our donor dollars and strategic investment model, 6,000 Albertans would not have been able to take part in clinical trials over the past five years. More than 1,800 Albertans would have to worry about how to pay their mortgage or make financial ends meet, instead of being able to concentrate on healingas your dollars allow them to do now. This time next year, we may be able to say that we saved 100 people from dying of lung cancer, thanks to our investment into a provincial screening program we support. We want this list to go on and on.Please read on in our Annual Report to learn more about our plans to be bold and do something about cancer. Link to Annual Report:http://albertacancerreport.ca/","No one invests without expecting a return on their investment. In our case, that return is the biggest and most important one we can imagine: healthy loved ones. What is a more important measurement of success than that?With a sense of urgency for results, the Alberta Cancer Foundation has shifted the paradigm of how to turn philanthropic dollars into true progress. We are accountable to our donors, stakeholders, investors, collaborators and most of all, patients and families, to make an impact and improve outcomes for Albertans. Together with healthcare partners and our donors:We make strategic investments in research, prevention, screening and enhanced care that have a direct line of sight to patients.We accelerate the pace of progress by bringing together donors, patients, health-care providers and researchers to unlock innovative and novel solutions.We drive innovation by seeking the most promising opportunities, supporting collaboration and strengthening partnerships to expand the scope of knowledge.Our strategic goals are focused on outcomes:Reduce peoples risk of developing cancerDiagnose cancer earlierImprove the effectiveness of cancer treatmentsImprove the care and quality of life for cancer patients and their families.","More than 120,000 Albertans are alive today after a cancer diagnosis, thanks in part to the work we do and our donors commitment. But, this is a more crucial time than ever. The investments we make today, will bring us the next advancements that will save even more lives.We invite you to learn more about making an investment that matters to you. An investment that provides the gift of more moments to those 16,000 Albertans each year who hear the words you have cancer.

"7",746,"Alberta Children's Hospital Foundation","Meet Maddie.  During a volleyball tryout, she experienced bad pain in her back, knee and hand. Tests ordered by her family doctor came back normal. The pain resurfaced and Maddie went to the Alberta Childrens Hospital, where specialists noticed her spleen seemed enlarged and ordered some scans. Soon, Maddie and her family were given a shocking and devastating diagnosis. She had a cancerous mass called neuroblastoma that was 20 cm by 10 cm in size located behind her spleen and wrapped around her aorta.Because it was too risky to operate, Maddie underwent four rounds of chemotherapy to try and shrink the tumour. It caused her to become very sick and she even woke up Christmas morning with her hair falling out. Unfortunately, even after chemo, the mass remained, so despite the risks, it was determined surgery was the only option. Her surgery team set out to remove the majority of the tumour but, in the end, removed all 15 lbs. of it during a 14-hour operation.Maddie is now leading a happy and healthy life and using her outgoing personality and quick wit for good. She, along with friends, family and supporters, have raised tens of thousands of dollars for the Alberta Childrens Hospital Foundation to help other kids. Her tumour was donated to the Tumour Bank where researchers can take samples of it for their studies. Her story continues to inspire those close to her and strangers alike.Maddie is one of our many inspirations. With your help, we can continue to achieve the best possible outcomes for all of the young patients who rely on the hospital.","The Alberta Childrens Hospital Foundation helps provide kids and their families the best possible care right in our own community. Our goal is simple:To help children who suffer from an injury or illness go back to doing what they do best: Just being kids.As the official fundraising body for the Alberta Childrens Hospital, all money raised is invested in the hospital and child health needs in this region. Through the generosity of our donors, we are able to provide funding for family-centred programs, specialized life-saving equipment and advanced pediatric research and education. We support excellence in pediatric health care, with focuses in Brain Health, Childhood Cancer, Life-Saving Care, Genetics and Research.We are honoured to work with the dedicated team of caring professionals at our hospital and even prouder to be part of a community that shares our vision. Together, we can build healthier futures for all of our children.","Generous community support helps establish new initiatives and resources at the hospital as well as develop and upgrade current ones. The Foundation works closely with Alberta Health Services to support the work and mission of the hospital. Representatives of the hospital serve on the Foundation Board of Directors. Likewise, the Foundation is represented on the Hospital Management Council and the Child Health Advisory Committee.While changes have been made in health care over the years, the principle on which the hospital was founded remains the same: The Alberta Childrens Hospital is dedicated to providing the finest possible health care for our children. Todays challenge is to maintain these exceptional standards at a time when pediatric practice is changing. Calgarys population is growing rapidly and new advances in treatment and medical equipment are available, but expensive.The generous support received by the Foundation from our many donors is a constant source of encouragement and hope to the patients, families and staff of the hospital. This funding serves to enhance not only the quality of health care, but also the quality of life for our children.These are just a few of the many initiatives and programs made possible with donations from the community.Therapeutic Arts  Its incredible to see the difference that music, art, plants and animals can make in a childs recovery. Thanks to the help of our generous donors, we fund specialists, resources and artistic outlets for children and families who can benefit from these creative therapies in the midst of more conventional medical treatments.Hospital at Home  Donor support helped the Alberta Childrens Hospital launch a pilot program that was the first of its kind in Canada. Hospital at Home allows some children to receive portions of their treatment, such as chemotherapy infusions, in the comfort of their own homes, thanks to house calls by specialists. This relieves much of the time and financial pressures for families, as well as the emotional stress of regular visits to the hospital.Rotary Flames House  Located adjacent to the Alberta Childrens Hospital, Rotary Flames House provides respite and end-of-life care to children with complex and life-limiting medical conditions. Donor dollars made the construction of this special home possible and community support ensures that families and caregivers benefit from respite services and day programming. Respite care not only allows for families to get much needed rest and renewal, it provides recreational, social and developmental opportunities for patients as well.Research  Thanks to generous community support, there are more than 200researchers at the Alberta Childrens Hospital and the Alberta Childrens Hospital Research Institute working to increase knowledge about childhood disease, develop new and better drug therapies and eradicate disease for future generations. With your help, our scientists can help ensure that more children live longer, with fewer lasting side effects and to their fullest potential. Investment in research today will change childrens lives for many years to come  here and around the world.KidSIM  Like flight simulation for pilots, high-tech human patient simulation is becoming increasingly important in training medical professionals for potentially lethal emergencies. Thanks to community support, the Alberta Childrens Hospital KidSIM team has helped pioneer this field in Canada and provides crucial training within the largest on-site pediatric simulation lab in the country. Each year, 4,000 health care providers and students are able to use sophisticated mannequins that simulate breathing, pulses, blood pressure, speech and sound during mock trauma and resuscitation drills better preparing them for real life emergencies.","You have the power to save and change lives. Every gift  big or small  provides hope, help and healing to the 94,000 children and families who rely on the Alberta Childrens Hospital each year. Your support is helping achieve excellence in care for families who are often in the midst of very challenging times.There are many ways to support the Alberta Childrens Hospital Foundation.Circle of Care  As part of the prestigious Woodmark Group, this special program recognizes individuals and couples who support the hospital with annual gifts of $10,000 or more through single or multiple contributions.Legacy Gifts  Give a gift that will celebrate your lifetime and help generations of children to come by leaving a donation in your Will.Candy Cane Gala  Purchase a table or consider becoming a sponsor of our annual Candy Cane Gala, a black-tie event that provides a mountain of fun for the entire family.Community Initiatives Organize an event of your own or set up a personal fundraising page to support the hospital.Radiothon  Become a Miracle Maker through our annual Country 105 Caring for Kids Radiothon by pledging $18 per month to support the care of sick and injured kids at the hospital.

"8",691,"Alberta Council for Environmental Education","The need for environmental education has grown to the point where it must become mainstream learning for children, youth and educators. Why? Three reasons:Children spend less time outside and more time indoors in front of screens.We have an responsibility to learn to live sustainably, to enjoy and steward Albertas wonderful natural resources, and prepare future generations to do the same.There are few resources to help Albertans develop a passion and learn the skills to protect our planet, even in curriculum.About 12 years ago, when I was working at an outdoor centre, Miles - one of those grade six students you never forget - approached me and asked if I wanted to hear an environmental joke. Being a willing victim for childrens humour, I said sure. Miles sad, Knock, knock, and I responded predictably, Whos there? At this point, Miles simply turned around and walked away. I stood there searching for the meaning of this joke. I later caught up with him and asked him to explain the joke. He said simply, Thats it. Nobodys there. The environment has been destroyed. That year I discovered an alarming pessimism and sense of helplessness regarding the future of the earth among his fellow students. What Miles needed was to become more environmentally literate. ~Jeff Reading, ACEE Board memberWhen it comes to climate change, the antidote to despair is action. ~Leah Buchanan, student at Queen Elizabeth High School, and former Chair of ACEEs Alberta Climate Leadership Youth Network","As a leader in environmental education, ACEE works at a systems level to reform K-12 education curriculum and bring environmental education into the mainstream; at the grassroots level by guiding children and youth to become environmental leaders in Alberta; and every level in between through its partnerships and professional development for educators.We currently have a superb opportunity to advance environmental educationin the new K-12 Alberta curriculum. The last time this opportunity existed was 20 years ago. At that time, our Executive Director Gareth Thomson successfully worked with Education staff to add a wetlands unit to the fifth grade curriculum; since that time almost 1 million Alberta youth have gone through that unit to experientially understand and appreciate the complex nature of the wetland ecosystem.Now, were working to infuse environmental, energy, and climate change education in to multiple subject areas. Working in collaboration with Alberta Education, ACEE will positively impact the new curriculum development. Education Minister David Eggen paralleled ACEEs hope and direction in his keynote address at the Edmonton area Education on Planet Earth conference by saying We cannot look at environmentalism the same way that we have for the last 20 years. Weve moved a long ways to evolve and to make sure it is not a separate subject but it is infused in all subject areas all the time, through mathematics, physics, chemistry, social studies, economics and career and life management to connect ourselves with our natural climate and to connect ourselves with a more diversified economy.ACEEs accomplishments inguiding children and youth to become environmental leadersare really their accomplishments. We are proud of our students - and excited that our work with them is making a difference! In early 2016, we engaged with Alberta youth who created How Alberta Schools should show Climate Leadership, a set of recommendations for leaders capturing the knowledge, opinions, and passion of over 3000 students. Premier Rachel Notley met with our students and on June 7, 2016 students presented their recommendations to the Ministers of Education and Environment  Parks. The students work figured prominently in the October 26, 2016 announcement of nine million dollars to ensure that new schools will all have solar panels:The recommendation of the solar panels actually came from students themselves with the work that Gareth Thomson and The Alberta Council of Environmental Education has been doing. We took their suggestions from the white paper and put them to action. We had the chance to meet with some of the brilliant young people behind that work this spring, myself and Shannon Phillips, and we are following through on more of their recommendations in the months ahead.~Education Minister David EggenACEE is well respected in the environmental education community and is especiallyknown for its partnerships and professional development.Through conferences, workshops, celebration events and reconnection retreats ACEE convenes groups to learn from each other and create cooperative synergies together. Educators have come to rely on ACEEs monthly newsletter and professional development to help them bring environmental education and sustainability into the classroom. Here are a few teachers testimonials:You do so many wonderful projects and programs - I always look forward to your emails with all the great initiatives, workshops, and ways we can help our kids help the world! Our Eco Club was the direct result of what I learned at your Canmore Earth Matters Conference!! ~L. MargetakThe talk [keynote] by the students really furthered my passion for teaching environmental education, as I saw the massive impact that the students learning experiences had on them.~UnknownAlways great to see so many change makers under one roof~UnknownThe conference has helped me understand how to discuss and bring environmental concepts into my classroom in an engaging way.~Simon Stenseth","We believe that the health and wellness of Albertans relies on a healthy environment. We promote environmental education so that Albertans will understand the interconnections between the environment, economy, and society - and develop the knowledge, skills, attitudes, and behaviours to create a sustainable future.We offer the following programs and resources to help advance environmental education in Alberta:Propose new curriculum for our 700,000 students. To build a prosperous and sustainable future for our province, we need to provide the students in K-12 schools in Alberta with new curriculum that will dramatically increase their energy environmental, and climate literacy. Weve created Curriculum for a Sustainable Future, whichoutlines key concepts and student learning outcomes for science, social studies and wellness that are needed for students to be energy and environmentally literate, and identifies teaching and learning resources and assessment techniques for teachers. This document is a key tool in our onging work with Alberta Education.Engage youth around how Alberta Schools can show Climate Leadership (Year Two).In 2016 we worked with over 3000 Alberta high school students on this topic. They presented their findings to the Education and Environment and Parks Ministers in June. This year the youth will speak to Albertas educational leadership at provincial and regional meetings, and work with them to help identify and take the next step towards climate leadership.Get Outside and Play Network.ACEE leads the Get Outside and Play network, which focuses on getting preschool children outdoors to enjoy and appreciate nature. There are now 600 members in the network from sectors such as health care, environmental education, play, sport, recreation and parks, child care, and early childhood development. Network activities include resource sharing, webinars, events and workshops.Get Outside and Play Week.At the end of May, ACEE organizes an annual Alberta-wide celebration of outdoor nature play. Childcare centres, families and communities use this week to jumpstart active outdoor nature play through direct, hands-on experiences and sharing inspirational stories that support the value of active outdoor nature play in the early years, with events taking place across the province in parks, childcare centres and backyards!

"9",519,"Alberta Institute for Wildlife Conservation","Matthew Flegault, it would appear, is one well organized 10-year old  hes clicking on to photographs he knows so well theyre almost memorized. Matthew has adopted one young eagle (an asked-for Christmas present) injured faraway in the Northwest Territories when very young. Its part of services offered by WestJet transporting injured wildlife to the Madden facilities of the Alberta Institute for Wildlife Conservation (AIWC). He refers to another image of a big-eyed downy fluffed sort of bird with enormous yellow feet that eagles apparently grow into. The whole history, he tells me, is on their Facebook page...Matthews family subscribe to their monthly newspaper  and where he first read about helping by adopting an animal. He and his family have fundraised, collecting bottles. He wants to volunteer, although thatll be a few years yet until hes well into his teens (because of liability issues that face many such facilities these days). His older sister Ariane busks summertime at Bearspaw Farmers Market; the money goes towards buying towels and similar, useful items  all three siblings collect branches that will be used in rehab cages for natural perch settings.Listening to them as they wander in and out, Matthew chatting away, makes reporter Pam Asheton wonder how typical, representative of young people these days these three are  theyve even noticed a housing development up the road has made local foxes move out, before exclaiming about a real experience with a barn owl.That Matthew values that adoption certificate, will remember his Christmas present, is just so obvious.Source: Pam Asheton (Feb 13, 2015): Cochrane Times: LIFE - Youth working to save wildlife.Alberta is home to some of the most majestic and iconic animals associated with North America.Animals native to Alberta include the bald eagle, the beaver, the big horn sheep, the bison, the blue jay, the Canada Goose, the lynx, the caribou, the cougar, the flying squirrel, the great blue heron, the grizzly bear, the monarch butterfly, the moose, the common loon, the peregrine falcon, the porcupine, the pronghorn, the red fox, the great horned and snowy owl, the striped skunk, the white-tailed deer and the gray wolf, just to name a few.We believe in cultivating strong co-existence between Albertans and wildlife animals.95% of animals are injured or orphaned due to human activities. The most common causes of injury are window strikes, vehicle collision, hitting power lines, barbed wire, fishing line entanglement or ingestion, domestic cat and dog attacks, and exposure to toxins. Often wildlife is orphaned by needless rescuing of babies who should have been left where they were.Each year, the demand for our services increases. In 2015, AIWC:Treated 1,675 wild animals and helped hundreds more by assisting members of the public with wildlife-related issues, educating Albertans about natural wildlife behaviours and how best to live alongside our wildlife; andAnswered more than 5,000 wildlife related calls, providing assistance and information to support the wellbeing, and, in some cases, the survival of animals.","Since 1993, the Alberta Institute for Wildlife Conservation (AIWC) has been a champion for the rehabilitation of injured and orphaned wildlife. Accredited through the Alberta Veterinary Medical Association, AIWC serves the needs of Albertas diverse wildlife in Calgary and southern Alberta. As a registered charity, AIWC relies on charitable donations and dedicated volunteers to support the more than 1,600 varied animals in need of care every year. AIWC welcomes Albertas injured, orphaned, and oiled wildlife, small and large, from hummingbirds to moose calves.Our Vision Every wild life matters.Our Mission AIWC is committed to the rescue, rehabilitation, and release of injured and orphaned wildlife. We provide expert advice and education that fosters an appreciation of wildlife.Once animals arrive at AIWC they are fully examined to determine the extent of their injuries. Further testing is often required, such as blood and/or fecal sampling, and radiograph diagnostics. With the completion of our surgical suite in 2009, patients are no longer transported to an off-site clinic for procedures which greatly reduces their stress levels.At the clinic, our staff and volunteers provide treatment and supportive care to the wildlife patients. Each patients diet varies, being as close as possible to its natural diet. In the case of orphaned animals, they must be taught to forage or hunt for their own food as they develop.As an animal progresses, gaining strength, and injuries healing, it will be moved into larger enclosures and finally be moved into an outdoor enclosure. When housed outside, the animal can properly prepare for release back into the wild by conditioning its body and acclimatizing to the weather. Once an animal is strong enough, volunteers often get the opportunity to release the animal back into its natural habitat. When possible and where safe to do so, we release the animal back to where it was found. If not possible, an appropriate habitat will be chosen to provide each animal with the greatest chance of survival.Our Annual Results for 2015:our biggest achievements in 2015 was purchasing the land AIWChas resided on since 1993; and also...close to 1,700 patients were admitted;5,000 wildlife related calls have been answered; andnearly 4,000 individuals attended our wildlife educations programs.","Wildlife Rehabilitation and Rescue: Our small team of wildlife biologists and technicians receive critical assistance from volunteer veterinarians. More than 130 highly trained volunteers provide rehabilitative animal care and support the release of our patients back into the wild.Our wildlife hospital, once a church in Didsbury, Alberta, is now a clinic with a surgical suite, laboratory, x-ray room, and various care units. Outdoor enclosures support the rehabilitative cycle and include two large flight-conditioning spaces for raptors, five songbird enclosures, a pasture and corral for young deer and moose, a waterfowl pen, a shorebird enclosure, and four mammal enclosures.Primarily, animals are rescued by our team of trained volunteers or by members of the public and then admitted to our centre. AIWC is an accredited vet hospital through the Alberta Veterinary Medical Association (ABVMA) and upon arrival animals are left to rest for a short time and then are fully examined my members of staff.All wildlife rehabilitation is performed on site at our 9.69-acre property NW of Airdrie. We are permitted through the provincial and federal governments to intake and care for wildlife. AIWC is one of only 2 facilities in Alberta that is permitted to intake injured and orphaned coyote pups. In addition, we are equipped to rehabilitate high stress seabirds (loons, grebes) and oiled wildlife.Wildlife rehabilitation is a relatively new field of animal care, becoming more prominent in the past 20-30 years. As such, we are constantly striving to improve protocols and methods of rehabilitation. Staff attend workshops, conferences, and collaborate with other wildlife rehabilitation centres across the world in order to ensure we are providing the best care possible to the animals entrusted into our care.Wildlife Education Program:We have a shared responsibility to wildlife.For as long as there have been people, there have been dangers to our wildlife. Each Albertan, young and old, plays an important role in the proactive understanding and reactive care of our wildlife. Each one of us has a responsibility to do something to support our wildlife population.We will continue to advocate for the health of our wildlife.Our primary mandate will always be to provide support and readiness to injured, orphaned or oiled wildlife animals. We believe in a community approach to taking the best care possible to animals that live and play in the same places we do.We believe every Albertan should be a stakeholder in the care of wellbeing of our wildlife animals.To ensure future generations of Albertans can enjoy our wildlife landscape, we encourage Albertans to:Appreciate and co-exist with nature and wildlifeBe mindful of their surroundings and foster safe spaces for wildlife to graze, breed and thriveEncourage interconnectedness with natureUnderstand the issue affecting Albertas conservation initiativesCaring isnt enough. We must take action.Every animal is deserving of the beauty Alberta has to offer, and this includes a safe, open environment free of human hazards. And we, as Albertans, have a responsibility to foster these opportunities through awareness and participation in conservation-minded conversation and actions. Our wildlife should be a continued source of pride for all Albertans.We believe in developing awareness through education.Through outreach programming, were working to creating strong co-existence between Albertans and wildlife animals. In 2015, our animal ambassadors provided wildlife education to more than 3,800 members of the public.We want children to build a strong relationship with nature.Our actions impact the environment and its wildlife. We encourage children to respect the environment around them by inspiring a passion for conservation and sustainability. We know that children and youth who develop an early understanding of their relationship with nature and wildlife become life-long advocates for wildlife, champions for the care, protection and health of wild animals.We are advocates for encouraging environmental stewardship in the next generation.By educating children about nature and environmental awareness, we are informing Albertans of how their actions impact the environment and to think on a larger, provincial scale.It all comes down to this:We dont own the earth. We are the earths caretakers. We take care of it and all the things on it. And when were done with it, it should be left better than we found it. ― Katherine Hannigan, author","Each year the demand for our services grows, and as a non-profit organization we rely solely on our own fundraising to provide care for the nearly 2000 wild animals admitted each year.

"11",381,"Alberta Riparian Habitat Management Society (Cows and Fish)","Its a bright-blue, warm spring day in early June. Forty grim faced people are squeezedinto a community hall to talk about the state of their lake. Comments ricochet around theroom: I used to swim here as a child, but wouldntchance it now; its a long walk to the water; and, the lake stinks. The realization ofall the incremental and insidious changes of the past decades now cascades upon them.They chafe at the unfairness of it, that they are stuck in a community hall faced withthese changes, instead of being out, enjoying their little piece of paradise. Weve got tofix it, we want our children to play here, and the equally as telling comment, thevalue of my property is dropping embody the worried comments of the crowd. In thetransition from awarenessto action, were still a ways from an understanding that this is no smallrepair job, a circumstance that wont be turned around tomorrow. We just want it backto the pretty little spot it was. That may be wishful thinking, given the rapid escalationin the ageing process of the lake, exacerbated by shoreline development and nutrientsdelivered from the watershed.It may well be thatthe lake never was quitethe pretty little spot, given the tendency of mostcentral Alberta lakes to be high in nutrients, naturally. Their lake was probably always subject to somealgae blooms, but now they are happening most years. An old-timer in the group quietly confirms this with me, privately, during the coffee break. His observations are that the magnitude of problemshas grown with lakeshore development and expansion of agriculture and acreages in the surrounding watershed.Others would like to reach into their blame holsters and, like the gunfighters of old, pointtheir .45 calibre fingers at someone else. Between the farmers present and the lakefront residents,there is a heated exchange over who didwhat and when to the lake. It is a natural human tendency to see the collective impacts of others, but harder to see your own personal role in the issues that result from a series of long, slow, cumulative changes. This group will take a while to realize theownership of the issues includes all of them.They listen politely, if albeit somewhat sceptically, to the words and images of ourRiparian 101 presentation. Thisdescription of the ecological functions of their lake begins to help them unravel some ofthe mystery of the watershed, lakeshore and landscape under their tenure. Not all areinstant believers, but it sets up a bit of uncertainty which can only be assuaged throughmore information.Cows and Fish never sets out to educate people about their watershedin one blinding flash of knowledge. Rather, it is a process of building a cumulative bodyof knowledge, over time that creates, within individuals and the community, the capacityto make better or more appropriate decisions. The world we live in is a complex one, butsome elemental knowledge is required to allow us to fit into it, in a way that doesntpreclude options for the future.- story written by Lorne Fitch, P. Biol., Provincial Riparian Specialist - Cows and Fish, with edits by Norine Ambrose","Think of us in terms of partnerships, communities, stewardship, water quality and quantity, watersheds, biodiversity, and sustainability. We foster awareness about riparian areas and watersheds, and how improvements in management can enhance landscape health and productivity, for the benefit of landowners, communities and others who use and value these green zones.What is a Riparian Area? Riparian areas are lands adjacent to streams, rivers, lakes and wetlands, where the vegetation and soils are strongly influenced by the presence of water. Although they make up only a small fraction of the land, they are among the most productive and valuable of all landscape types and have been a focus of conflicts between resource users.Riparian areas need to be healthy to function properly. Some of those functions include trapping sediments, recharging ground water, providing primary productivity, and supporting biodiversity. We help cattle producers, lakefront residents,landowners, and their communities understand how healthy their riparian areas are, both on their individual operations and in their local watersheds. Understanding riparian health, or function, allows entire communities and individual producers to identify concerns and to proactively address specific land use issues.Our Mission:To promote the improvement of riparian areas, their ecological processes and functions, through a collaborative partnership and voluntary, proactive community-based action that uses education and awareness about management options for producers, other landowners and their communities.Our Objectives:to promote an understanding of riparian health and functionto communicate the benefits of good riparian managementto promote proactive voluntary solutions to riparian area conflictsto demonstrate value of cooperative, interdisciplinary and community efforts in resolving resource conflicts and addressing management challengesto improve the overall productivity and health of Albertas landscapes and communitiesRiparian health assessment relies on visual observation, a little practice and fine-tuning your eye to accurately interpret the health or function of a riparian area. Riparian health assessment helps you address the questions Where am I?, Where do I want to go?, and Did I make it? in terms of riparian health. Both vegetative and physical parameters are examined to provide information about the function and condition of that riparian area. Riparian health assessment and inventory also:CREATES AWARENESSamong producers, other landowners and their communities about riparian management issues in their local watersheds;HELPS LANDOWNERS AND COMMUNITIES TAKE VOLUNTARY ACTIONby assisting local decision-makers develop strategies to find solutions to address local riparian issues;HELPS COMMUNITIES AND INDIVIDUALS MONITOR THEIR PROGRESSin improving, maintaining and protecting riparian health in their watershed or operation;ASSISTS CATTLE PRODUCERS TO IDENTIFY ENVIRONMENTAL RISK AND INTEGRATE THAT INFORMATION INTO FARM AND RANCH PLANNING, taking stock of current conditions and identifying management options for improvement if required.Awards Received:Alberta Emerald Award 2005 - Education: Organization For recognizing organizations within the non-formal education system that have gone beyond the normal practices and shown leadership in educating students about environmental matters.Canadian Environmental Award - Environmental Learning Gold Winner 2003 For our commitment to environmental learning and our community-based approach.Society for Range Management Awards Awarded for our promotion and enhancement of the stewardship of rangelands to meet human needs based on science and sound policy.","I cant say enough good about Cows and Fish, from the excellent training, the hands-on training, monitoring, good facilitation skills, the incredible knowledge you people have, and the way you are able to bring it down to the farmer level, and to the colleague level. An excellent grass-roots program. Northern Alberta Municipal Staff MemberThe Cows and Fish Program is based on a set of five elements or phases which collectively make up the Cows and Fish Process and you can learn more about this process by clicking here:Cows and Fish process.Awareness: Being informed helps people make good decisions!Team Building: Communication and trust are key to good relationships.Tool Building: Provide opportunities to learn a variety of riparian management alternatives.Community-Based Action: Agricultural producers, landownersand communities drive the process.Monitor and Evaluate: Did we make it?We are available to help landowners, communities and local stewardship groups:Understandriparian areafunctions and valuesAccess technical advice andeducational materialsExamine and monitor the health of their riparian areasEvaluate and suggest management strategiesWe work at the invitation of landowners and local communities to deliver our program: Whether urban or rural, weencourage you to invite us to work with your community! Whether it is educational presentations, bringing together a team of technical experts to work with residents, hands-on learning to increase management skills, tours ofnearby areas to share lessons learned, or helping your community move beyond finger-pointing to stewardship ethic and action, we can help with riparian and watershed management.One key area we use to engage, motivate and inform is the riparian health assessment. The purpose of riparian health assessment and inventory is to provide better information on riparian health or function to assist landowners and land managers make the best decisions to manage their riparian resources effectively. Combined with practical knowledge and wisdom about their own ranch, farm, land or watershed, riparian health information will help landowners and managers find better land management solutions.Here are several ways in which riparian health assessment and inventory are delivered:AS PART OF A COMMUNITY-BASED PROCESS OR INITIATIVE,usually on a local watershed, involving awareness and education, team building, tool and information building, and monitoring (see Cows and Fish Process for more information).AFTER AN INVITATION FROM A COMMUNITY OR PRODUCER GROUP, we meet with local municipal staff, Agricultural Service Board representatives, agricultural fieldmen, producer or community group leaders, and other local individuals to discuss potential riparian management tools the group can implement as part of their local voluntary plan to address land use issues in their local watershed.WHEN THE PRODUCER OR COMMUNITY GROUP DECIDES TO IMPLEMENT RIPARIAN HEALTH ASSESSMENT, they determine which stream systems or watersheds to target as part of their community-based initiative. At their invitation, we provide information on riparian areas and health at a local meeting, and ask the community to decide if they would like to proceed with riparian health assessment and inventory. If they want to proceed, they secure funding to help cover part of the cost of the riparian health inventories.WE ALSO HOST FIELD DAYS FOR LOCAL PARTICIPANTSto learn more about riparian health assessment hands-on, provide riparian and grazing management information, and examine sites for demonstration or profile potential, depending on requests from the group or community. We encourage communities to monitor their progress at meeting their goals for healthy, sustainable operations and watersheds.----As a farmer, I dont know what I can do, but I know I can do something.                - Northern Alberta LandownerLots of people give us things to think about, Cows and Fish gives us thinks to think with.  -Central Alberta Landowner","If we can do stewardship on our farm and make a difference, theres a lot of other farms out there that can do it too.

"14",206,"Alberta Tomorrow Foundation","Alberta has seen unprecedented change in the past few decades, resulting in a vibrant and prosperous economy but placing strain on our natural landscape - the land, air and water, that sustain it.Picture in your mind a place in Alberta you used to visit, drive by, or live in. Now imagine what is looks like today. Has itbeen changed into something totally different? Was it a slough that contained hundreds of breeding ducks, a colorful wildflower meadow, or a dense forest where you were guaranteed to see moose that has now become a city or town? Land-uses such as oil and gas, agriculture, forestry settlement and recreation are all competing for limited resources.Unfortunately our land and resources are finite, and future growth must follow land-use plans that balance the environmental, economic and societal values of all Albertans.It was interesting to see the changes the landscape has been through over the past 100 years and how by using best practices in our daily lives, we can help make the future better. Grade 11 studentBefore using Alberta Tomorrow I didnt know what ecology was. Now I want to be a Biologist. - Grade 4 studentOne of the most critical issues confronting contemporary society is the need to effectively plan our future landscapes. Proper planning requires an understanding of the trade-offs being made as we chose to how to provide Albertans with food, fiber, shelter, recreation, energy, transportation and other infrastructures. These concepts may sound complex but they can be understood by young adults. Alberta Tomorrow is a dynamic online tool that helps Albertans of all ages understand the importance of this issue and how they might become involved in the dialogue of building a future Alberta we will be proud of.Dr. Brad Stelfox, Landscape EcologistALCES GROUP HISTORY | Alberta Tomorrow was originally created in 2005 by Matthew Carlson and Dr. Brad Stelfox of the ALCES group. Currenlty in its third reincarnation, Alberta Tomorrow has been used extensively by teachers and students throughout Alberta.Note: ALCES Landscape  Land-Use Ltd. is a unique collaboration of planners, environmental scientists, industry specialists, ecologists, computer simulation programmers, and management consultants who share a deep commitment to assisting clients with developing strategic plans for triple bottom line - people, planet and profit.","Alberta Tomorrow gives my students real life exposure to real life decisions...all at their fingertips.

Alberta Tomorrow has helped change the thinking of Alberta students, the decision makers of tomorrow!","Weve developed an educational tool that gives students hope for the future. Free lesson plans, linked to the Alberta Education Curriculum, assist teachers in using the on-line simulator in their classroom. Through public presentations, teacher training and classroom visits, we help Albertans work through the simulator as they create the future theyd like to see for Alberta.Alberta Tomorrow is an organization that currently embraces the direction Alberta Education in allowing students to work with real-life data to gain greater understanding in the process of sustainable land-use planning. Through viewing past, present and future data, students can actively plan how Alberta can look tomorrow with both a sustainable economy and environment. This GIS simulation platform is an incredibly interactive tool that allows students to proceed through inquiry learning as they attempt to solve their own sustainable planning goals. - Dave Gowans, Calgary Catholic School Division APPROACH | As students identify their own environmental priorities, they establish their own goals. Not all plans are the same, which leads students to realize that it is difficult to make a sustainable land-use plan when multiple perspectives exist. Alberta Tomorrow helps students learn that it is possible to have economic growth without adversely affecting the enviroment. Citizen Scientists and students are encouraged to upload water quality and land-use data so that it can be shared with users across the province.

"15",743,"Alberta Wilderness Association","Around a kitchen table at a home near Pincher Creek, a group of concerned friends gathered and the conversation brought them to the last backpacking trip they were on, the day they were out looking through their scope for Bighorn sheep and the changes they were seeing on the landscape. The changes that were affecting wildlife, the quiet they once knew, the dust in the air, the growing logging and oil and gas activity and the changes in how they could enjoy the wilderness they had always known. Feisty and part of the 60s revolution, this group of formidable people with the vision to realize something must be done to protect wild spaces sought the help of government and other organizations that they thought would be concerned too. In the end, they were the ones who would advocate and speak up for wildlife and wilderness and they formed the Alberta Wilderness Association.More than 50years later, almost certainly they had no idea their concerns would befelt as strongly today as it was in the beginning.WhileAlberta Wilderness Associationworks throughout Alberta, it is an especially crucial time now for the Castle Wilderness of southeast Alberta.The long overdue protection needed for the Castle Wilderness is as close as it has ever been.This wilderness is often referred to as restoration wilderness, largely because of theoveruse and abuse it has suffered from multiple competing interests. It is time to let nature take its course and help restore vital headwater security andhabitat for threatened and endangered species like native trout, grizzly bears and truly rare plants and trees.That the vision and determination thefounding membersof Alberta Wilderness Association had has helped so many become aware and speak up for wildlife and wilderness is a priceless legacy; one well beyond their imaginings.Today with more than 7000 members and supporters, we are dependent on the vision and determination of people throughout the province to help us be strong and to make a differencein thelegacy we will leave generations to come.","As population increases and the industrial footprint expands, Albertas wilderness urgently needs better protection than is now in place. Provincial protected areas are small and isolated, many of them allow industrial development and inappropriate recreational activities and many natural regions are poorly represented in the current network. The connectivity between protected areas and functioning ecosystems is essential to the maintenance of biodiversity.We are the only independent province-wide organization working steadily for more than 50 years toward the completion of a protected areas network and the conservation of wilderness throughout Alberta. Our tenacity, longevity, passion and integrity are well-recognized and respected, providing us with a credible platform from which to defend Albertas wild places. Sometimes our successes are measurable, but more often, we know we are making a difference through by-the-way comments from members of the public.We work with individuals and organizations across Alberta to increase awareness and help people become environmental stewards who care about the health of our wilderness and wildlife; who realize the importance of protecting the source of our water. We also engage politically on issues concerning wilderness conservation in the province in the areas of WILDLANDS, WILDLIFE and WILDWATER.Our results from being actively involved in developing government policy over the years:the Coal Policy (1976)the Eastern Slopes Policy (1970s/80s)the Land-Use Framework (2007/08)Wetlands Policy (2008)Effectively opposed water diversion projects such as the Meridian Dam and the Oldman River DamWorked tirelessly toward the protection of ecologically significant areas such as the Castle and the Bighorn in the Eastern Slopes, and the McClelland Lake wetlands in the mineable oil sands region, and Suffield, Milk River and Rumsey in the grassland and parkland regions.","We share our expertise and participate in community-based and government-led processes to increase awareness and help people become environmental stewards who care about the health of our wilderness and wildlife through hikes, field trips, speaker series and classroom presentations.EDUCATIONAlberta Wilderness Resource Centre (Roger Creasey Memorial Library)is AWAs resource centre, library and world class collection on all things wilderness in the province of Alberta.

We help people like Eva whove learned first-hand what its like to have dementia in her family.Evas journey was powerful, heartbreaking and life-altering.When my mother passed away, my Dad (Josef) could manage well enough by himself. He could drive; prepare his own meals and garden. I was always very close to him and we spoke every day. Gradually, things began to change.Its so hard to know when something might be wrong, or when its just getting old  things like memory loss and slowing down physically. I started to notice small things; like Dad would re-tell stories or wed have the same conversations over and over. He was officially diagnosed with Alzheimers disease at the age of 79.New insight from the Alzheimer Society of Calgary gave Eva fresh perspective.Caring for a person with dementia impacts your health. It can be very stressful and it really affected me. Im so grateful for the support I got from the Alzheimer Society of Calgary. I enrolled in a workshop for family caregivers and it was life-changing for me  the things I learned, and how much more I understood. To understand what was happening in Dads brain when hed act a certain way made it easier not to get upset. The tools and tips also helped me to appreciate the time I had with my Dad and not to worry about the small stuff.And I learned you can still laugh! I remember trying to explain to him that he couldnt get up and walk because he might fall. I cant walk?! But I was out walking by the river just this morning! he said.Theres a lot to be grateful for. Im very grateful that he never forgot who I was, that he always recognized me.And I would like others on this journey to know that its important to learn as much as possible and to find out the facts.I support the Alzheimer Society of Calgary as a donor because I really want to help other people.

"17",548,"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Society of Alberta","The following story shares how the ALS Society of Alberta helps to make it possible for those living with and affected by ALS...Gerald Andersons granddaughter, Amanda, played a very special role in his life. Amandas wedding day was nearing and she wanted nothing more than to have her papa (as she called him), walk her down the aisle on her special day. As Geralds ALS diagnosis progressed, the wedding was set to take place at the Misericordia Hospital in Edmonton where he was being cared for.Amandas wedding day dream became a reality when Gerald was able to guide her down the aisle, thanks to help and support of the ALS Society of Alberta.What is Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)?ALS is a rapid, always fatal, neurodegenerative disease. It attacks the nerves that the body would normally use to send messages from the brain to the muscle, resulting in weakness and wasting. Eventually, the individual with ALS is left completely immobilized, with loss of speech and eventually an inability to swallow and breathe.The sensory neurons in people living with ALS continue to function normally so that they will continue to feel the sensations of heat, cold, discomfort, etc. The mind often remains completely alert and lucid. The result is often a lively, unimpaired mind trapped in an immobilized body. The average life expectancy from symptom onset is three to five years; the real challenge in the medical community at large is correctly diagnosing ALS in the early stages, so that the ALS Society of Alberta is able to provide the maximum level of assistance to the person living with ALS and that persons family.Approximately 3,000 Canadians live with ALS and two to three Canadians die every day of ALS. There is no known cause or cure for this devastating disease.","The ALS Society of Alberta is dedicated to making each day the best possible day for people living with and affected by Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).The number one priority for the ALS Society of Alberta is to ensure that each ALS clients needs are being met. The Society relies heavily on its donors and volunteers in order to provide the best possible support and care for ALS clients in Alberta. From community events and ALS WALK fundraisers across the province, to providing care and eqiuptment for those living with and affected by ALS, the accomplishments of the ALS Society of Alberta are due to the tremendous amounts of support received throughout the community.100% of ALS client requests were met in 2015 thanks to donor and volunteer support, including;361 clients supported in Alberta1,644 pieces of equipment were provided95 support groups held for clients, caregivers, families and children across the province47 families supported through the Support for Champions Program1,780 home visits were conductedThe ALS Society of Alberta graciously appreciates ongoing donor and volunteer support in order to continue meeting 100% of client requests and to make each day the best possible day for those living with and affected by ALS.","The ALS Society of Alberta provides support to clients and families across the province in a number of ways including:Facilitation and Provision of CareInformation and ReferralsSupport GroupsFrom home visits, to making medical equipment easily accessible to clients to the organization of support groups across the province, the client services team goes above and beyond to make sure that those living with and affected by ALS are living as comfortably and happily possible.

The Society covers the costs of delivery and pickup, and once the person no longer requires the equipment, it is cleaned and returned to the loan pool.Support GroupsThe ALS Society of Alberta offers various support groups and information sessions to help people living with ALS, their families and caregivers. All support groups and information sessions are provided free of charge.Support for YouthThe Support for Champions program allows children whose parents are affected by ALS to participate in normal childhood activities that may not be available to them due to the immense financial burden ALS can cause.To view the services provided through the ALS Society of Albertas client services team in more detail, please visithttp://www.alsab.ca/client-support-services/.","From volunteering at or hosting your own ALS community fundraiser, to becoming a monthly donor, to attending a WALK for ALS, every inch of support received helps to make each day the best possible day for those living with and affected by ALS.Below are some of the ways that you can help to make a difference and channel hope for a future without ALS;VolunteerThere are many volunteer opportunities within the Society.

"18",480,"Animal Rescue Foundation of Alberta (ARF) ","It started in 1992, when Calgary chiropractor Dr. Laurie Flavin saw a need, and began placing stray and abandoned dogs from Calgary Animal Services into suitable homes. By 1994, she was known as the Dog Lady. After being approached by the Animal Control Officer of the Siksika Nation, Laurie became aware of the huge dog and cat over-population problem in Albertas First Nations communities and decided to take on the enormous task of rescuing those dogs and cats and finding homes for them.Once she started, it became apparent that one person alone could not handle the influx of dogs and cats, so Laurie, along with the help of two friends, decided to form a charitable organization and in July 1995, the Animal Rescue Foundation (ARF) of Alberta was formed.A volunteers story...First, I would like to thank you for the amazing experience of being a foster home. It is by far the most rewarding volunteer opportunity that Ive had. It isnt always easy, but being able to be such a big part of finding a dog their forever home is more than worth it. We have been fostering with ARF for almost two years now and weve helped about 20 dogs and puppies on their way to their forever homes.But of course the biggest thing we are thankful for is that without ARF we never would have met our two amazing dogs Echo (husky) and Bailey. Echo started out with us as a foster and he struggled with separation anxiety and reactivity towards other dogs. I am happy to report that with a huge amount of support from ARF, working with Dogma Training and a lot of perseverance and patience Echo is now a perfect gentleman out on walks and is more than content hanging out at home alone.Bailey came to us at about six weeks old when we decided to try our hand at being a holding home for puppies until they are old enough to go to individual foster homes. Unfortunately, our stone cold hearts were no match for her wrinkly face or puppy antics and we formally adopted her as soon as she was eight weeks old. She has been the perfect puppy (knock on wood) and she continues to impress us every day. Together with our cat they make a great team showing our foster dogs the ropes and helping them to gain confidence.Thank you ARF for everything you do and continue to do. We look forward to many more years fostering and volunteering with ARF. - Chloe, Braden, Echo, Bailey and Atticus (The Cat)","Founded in 1995, ARFs mission is to rescue stray and unwanted dogs and cats from First Nations and rural areas and place them in loving, permanent homes while providing programs to reduce pet over-population. ARF is one of the most long-standing animal rescue groups in the community and is recognized as a well-run, fiscally responsible charity. ARFshigh rate ofsuccess is measured by low numbers of returned animals as a result of goodpet/owner matches.ARF is a no-kill rescue and our philosophy is toto foster the humane, compassionate and respectful treatment of all dogs and cats.Each year, ARF works to rescue countlessstray and abandoned dogs and cats in order to give them a secondchance. These animals have faced manyhardships ranging from hunger, disease,abuse, and freezing temperatures toencounters with predators and vehicles.Once rescued, ARF animals are placed inloving, caring foster homes where theyawait adoption. In addition to warmth andlove, they also receive the veterinary care and medical assistance they need to grow strong and live a healthylife. Since animals have little ability to choose their owners, we must act in their best interests. Some of the ways we do this are by:Placinganimals for adoptionin loving, caring, stable and lifelong homesArrangingtemporary foster homes,including providingmedical interventionsto animals in need of serious medical careVaccinating, de-worming, and spaying/neutering animalsprior to adoptionProviding spay/neuter and educational programs to residents of First Nations communitiesPracticing and promotingreward-based training techniquesfor dogsARFensures thatthe animals welfare is considered first and our volunteers have considerable experience in the humane treatment of animals. Wedo not operate an animal shelter; instead, we house all rescued animalsin foster homes who have the capability and understanding to rehabilitate animals with positive social experienceswithpeople and other animals.By providing food and medical care in these temporary homes, we are able to take the time to find the right match between our dogs and cats and their prospective adoptive families. ARFalso provides training for both pets andtheir new forever homes. You can visit with our adoptable dogs and cats at various events throughout the year.Cavas story...Sweet Cava and her puppies were rescued in July of last year. They arrived in ARFs hands in rough shape and their future looked bleak. But, with the dedicated, selfless and loving volunteers on which ARFs foundation is built, Cava and her puppies survived. I cannot convey to you in this language how grateful I am to these dedicated volunteers. Their love was constant.Amazingly, Cava is filled with love and intelligence. She is very patient with all the humans she meets and we are working on other species  namely dogs, squirrels, and bunnies!I have lived in the same home since 1969 and have had five other dogs but not one of them demonstrated the love for my neighbours that Cava has done daily while living with us.For all those who are associated with ARF  we extend our heartfelt thanks and financial support. With organizations like ARF, dogs like Cava can experience a loving forever home. Thank you.Sincerely,Eileen (forever home). -----To further ARFs mission, a permanent triage facility is required (PAD for PAWS) to both increase capacity and to provide emergency care to unwanted animals (pregnant moms like Cava) thatare difficult to placeimmediately in foster homes (pre-adoption).","Astrid was rescued on January 7th, 2014 at 3 months old. We received a call about an injured puppy and went out to see how we could help her. It is likely her injuries were due to an attack by another animal. She had several injuries to her back legs and immediately received surgery on puncture wounds.After more than a month of recovery, Astrids leg just wasnt healing the way it should, so we brought her to a specialist to see if there were any other underlying conditions that needed treatment. After x-rays and close examination, we found out that Astrid also has a torn cruciate ligament in her back leg. Due to some muscle atrophy around the injury site, it seems like this injury wasone that occurred previous to the attack.Astridfaced TPLO surgery  a very intensive, precise surgeryperformed by an orthopedic surgeon andshe required 16 weeks of recoveryand additional physiotherapy.ARF is committed to the long term and does everything it can to help a dog or cat once rescued. Astrids vet bills were over $6000 and these costs were paid for by ARF, thanks to our generous donors. ARF is a registered charity, staffed almost entirely by volunteers, and reliant on donations.Astrid was adopted by her foster home (their 3rd ARF dog). And she lives on a farm with horses, other dogs and kids.She is doing well after the surgeries on her leg and it only really bothers her when it is very cold outside. She can keep up to the horses when they are galloping around the field! She has become a great friend to our kids and loves to snuggle and play with them or her 2 big sisters. Emily(forever home) Astrids story is not unique and ARF makes sure all rescued dogs and cats get the best care, from rescue to adoption. ARF further provides training for both theadoptive parentsand animalsso they can form successful, solid relationships.","Donate: We have many expenses, one of the most critical being veterinary care. All donations are very gratefully accepted, and a tax receipt will be issued for any donation of $20 or more.Pad for Paws: Funds raised for the Pad for Paws Campaign will be put towards the acquisition of a permanent facility for ARF. This facility will be used to temporarily house sick or injured animals and offer refuge for nursing mothers, as well as provide a headquarters for ARF. To date, we have raised $520,000 and our goal is $1 million.Volunteer: ARF is proud to be run almost entirely by volunteers! Volunteers make ARF successful and they have a direct impact on the number of animals that we can rescue. Not only does volunteering have a meaningful impact on our community, but it also has a meaningful and positive impact on you! Some of the benefits of volunteering include:learning/developing new skillsbeing part of your communitya greater sense of achievementboosting your career optionsfinding new interests/hobbieshaving new experiences/meeting new peopleBe a Foster Home: We are always in need of committed foster parents who are able to give a rescued dog or cat a temporary home and get him started on his way. Most of our animals have never been inside a home before and have not always been treated very well; therefore, they need some basic training and lots of love. Our amazing foster homes carefor an animal and attend to all of itsneeds, including:vet appointments (if needed)feeding, walking and traininghaving potential adopters in your home to meet your fostermaking the final decision on who adopts your fosterand in the case of a dog, visiting the potential adopters home to see if their yard is secure and bringing him to PetSmart some weekends to meet potential adoptersPlease Note: All foster homes must be in the Calgary area. All food and medical care is provided.Host an Event: Help us rescue stray and unwanted dogs and cats by hosting an event or raising money for ARF!

"19",774,"Ann & Sandy Cross Conservation Area","Sandy Cross, the son of A.E Cross, a well-known Albertan and one of Calgarys Big Four, lived a humble and unassuming life maintaining his familys land and raising cattle. It was in 1973 that Ann Abbott captured the heart of this long-time bachelor, and the two were married. In 1987, Ann and Sandy donated 2000 acres of their land to the province to become the Ann  Sandy Cross Conservation Area.At the time, it was the largest private land donation in Canadian history, and in 1996, another 2800 acres were added. It was the dream of Ann and Sandy, concerned about encroaching urban development, to ensure that their land would be protected. For 30 years, the ASCCA has been striving to be a leader and an example in land conservation and sustainability, to inspire and engage people of all ages to reflect on the importance of preserving our remaining natural habitats so that they can remain refuges for wildlife and be appreciated by future generations long after we are gone.As the CEO of the Ann  Sandy Cross Conservation Area (ASCCA) I wanted to tell you about my favorite part of the day, it is when the students flood back into the building after spending the day interacting with nature, just before they get back on the school bus. In the few minutes that I speak with them I see how theyve been impacted by their time here. Their grins are from ear to ear and I can hardly hear as each child it trying to tell me what they learned that day. And every day I am reminded how important it is to teach our youth the importance of being outside and engaging with our environment. We provide funding for students from schools that require financial aid, and several are new Canadians, refugees or from low-income families who have not had opportunity to experience the unique natural setting of the Conservation Area. These students develop a deeper understanding of nature from which a conservation ethic may evolve. For many students their time at the ASCCA begins to instill in them an appreciation and enjoyment of the outdoors.- Greg Shyba, Ann  Sandy Cross Conservation Area CEO","We are striving to continue the Sandy Cross legacy, and have made it our mission to be an example in conservation, by providing important space for wildlife, offering conservation education programs and supporting community conservation initiatives. We aspire to a day when the Conservation Area is recognized from the local to the international level as a model of sustainability, a leader in landscape-level approaches to management of protected areas and a key contributor to collaborative approaches in conservation.The ASCCA showcases Albertas beautiful natural diversity with rolling foothills and a mixture of grasslands and aspen forests. We are unique in the way that we focus on a sustainable relationship with the land. Simply more than a destination for outdoor enthusiasts and hikers, it is a place for humans and nature to connect. It is home to over 400 plant species and an abundance of wildlife, and is also the first nocturnal preserve in Canada. We have welcomed thousands of youth and adults since our education program began in 1993, and we are excited to continue delivering important and engaging programming for years to come.ACCOMPLISHMENTS (2016)In the last year, we have: planted well over 100,000 trees through the wonderful efforts of the Junior Forest Wardens and through our partnership with the Carbon Farmer;taken steps to restore and protect the ASCCA, please take a look at our 25 Year Adaptive Management Plan which can be found here;begun to work on our stream monitoring program last summer; stream monitoring is one of the tools we use to determine how well were protecting the conservation area;engaged over 4300 students this year that landed on our doorstep as well as in their own schoolyards; and an education highlight was a weeklong Campus Calgary program with students who were new immigrants to Canada from over ten different countries. The teacher and students were both inspired and inspiring.","Conservation is more important than ever, due to the human impact on animal habitats. Natural areas like the Ann  Sandy Cross Conservation Area are important refuges for thousands of species of flora and fauna. As stewards of this land, we are responsible for maintaining and protecting the habitat. Donations and fundraising ensure that we can continue to protect this land for future generations and the diverse species that call us home.Since 2014 we have partnered with The Carbon Farmer towards our ambitious project of planting over 1 million trees, shrubs and native grasses on select portions of the 4800 acre conservation area. We have planted over 100,000 trees in working towards this goal. Although protected from human development, much of the conservation area was once used for agriculture, and native vegetation was removed. We are now seeking to use collaborative approaches to return the ASCCA to nature.Our environmental educators carry on Sandy Cross passion for the land and wildlife, educating youth and adults about the integral connection we have to nature. People enjoy the ASCCA with over 20 kilometers of scenic nature trails and self-guided interpretive walks, and since 1993 over 110,000 youth and adults have participated in hands-on, conservation based learning opportunities, from our award-winning education programs. We offer year-round community conservation learning events that aim to both educate and inspire.With innovative and immersive education programs ASCCA takes children out of the classroom and into the outdoors, exposing them to conservation and stewardship. During the students time at the ASCCA educational programs are delivered in a natural setting that promotes social awareness of environmental issues and provides first hand nature experiences. This program creates an inquiry driven environment that enhances critical-thinking, literacy, and problem-solving skills; as well as facilitating a deeper understanding of community, responsibility, cultural awareness, and stewardship. The ASCCA instills in these students a passion for the environment and the world around them. They begin to understand that they are just one piece in our eco-system and the importance of nature.I cannot express my gratitude enough for that extraordinary experience to learn about Aboriginals, the land, the animals, and how the environment works together. This hands-on experience has enriched my understanding of nature, ecosystem, and conservation and it has surely impacted my classmates as well.- Grade 7 student","A donation to the ASCCA is a donation that will enhance the future.

"20",736,"Antyx Community Arts Society","Curtis was referred to an Antyx community mural project by a community youth justice committee. He had committed his first criminal offense and needed to complete a number of mandated community service hours. He was a reluctant participant at first, showing little enthusiasm and declining to participate in much of the opening dialogue and project brainstorming. It was obvious he felt he was required to be there.As Curtis continued to put in his hours, changes began to occur. He began to help more with the project set-up and clean-up. He began to build more open connections with Antyx Staff and project artists. He began to connect socially and work cooperatively with the the other youth working on the project. Curtis invited his mother and sister to some of the mural painting sessions. He helped them paint parts of the mural and proudly showed them his work.Once his community service hours were completed, Curtis continued to work on the mural. He was the only project participant to attend every project session. At the mural unveiling celebration he received recognition and compliments from community members thankful for the mural the youth had created. During the celebration, Curits connected with each of the Antyx staff and project artists thanking them for the opportunity help create the mural and enthusiastically volunteering for the next mural project.Antyx uses the Arts toprovide youth, especially youth who are marginalised,with the means to understand themselves, connect with others and make a positive difference in their communities.Antyxs community-based art projects and programs foster critical thinking, encourages creative problem solving, promotes youth leadership and inspires collaboration. We support youth and community groups in Calgary in using the arts to address social issues that prevent youth from being safe, included and successful.To put it simply, art takes flight. Each art piece, theatre creation or photo captured is a direct result of youth identifying an issue that they relate with, understand and connect with. They recognize the imbalance of power, or oppression that each belief/stereotype/myth/action/ inaction holds to their lives and the lives of people around them. Then they create a piece of art that questions, challenges and hopefully brings social change by choosing an audience that can be inspired to take action or challenged to break an unhealthy belief system. (Antyx Staff)","Antyx Community Arts is a creatively unique organization that uses the arts as a tool to engage youth who are marginalized in their communities and mobilizes youth and community organizations in finding creative ways to address the issues that marginalize youth.Vision:Creative, vibrant communities fostering inclusion, participation, and potential.Mission:Community Arts: engaging, empowering, transforming.Values:We are enthusiastically committed to: Integrity, Diversity, Inclusivity, Creativity, and EmpowermentHistory:Antyx was formed on January 1, 2010 when All Nations Theatre and Urban Youth Worx merged and began operating as a single community arts organization. All Nations Theatre had worked in Calgary since 1992 engaging youth in participatory theatre projects that explored issues identified by youth. Founded in 1998, Urban Youth Worx supported the development of Arts Based community development projects across Calgary.Engagement:The creation of Antyx has sparked tremendous opportunities to engage youth and communities in using the arts to explore critical issues and make positive change. We have just begun to realize the potential that our newly formed larger organization has to increase our ability to engage individuals, communities and organizations in using the arts to make positive change in communities.Our community arts projects and programs provide a creative empowering experience for youth participants. Our interactive arts processes focus on the exploration of youth identified community issues and have many attributes that foster positive youth development. Youth not only participate in an arts based program they have opportunities to develop leadership skills and provide a community service through the presentation of art that encourages community discussion and problem solving about youth identified issues.In every project we aspire to engage youth as artists, activists and leaders in their communities.Impact:Participation in Antyx community arts programs provides youth with numerous opportunities to build skills, enhance protective factors, and form community based relationships that help to reduce youth vulnerability. These programs have a tremendously positive impact, not just on the youth and their families, but also in their communities.","Just like the youth we work with, each Antyx project is unique. Whether it is writing a hip hop song or shooting a video, producing a live theatre performance or painting a community mural, each Antyx project is youth-centred and addresses issues directly relating to the lives of project participants.Projects can vary in length, intensity and number of youth involved, reflecting Antyx ongoing commitment to customize programs to the needs of the community, while also empowering youth to take ownership over projects and leadership skills.We are currently focused on delivering creative programs within the communities of Greater Forest Lawn and North of McKnight. Our diverse projects are delivered in spaces in communities across Calgary that are easily accessible to youth who have few recreational opportunities.For more information, visit our website: www.antyx.org","Attend and Support Youth Arts Events: Come out and catch a play, watch a video screening, meet the artists at a photo exhibition or celebrate the unveiling of a new community mural or sculpture. Attending an Antyx Community Arts event is a great way to show your appreciation for the talent and creativity of young community artists and participate in creative discussions about issues important to youth. Visit our website (www.antyx.org) or follow us on Facebook or Twitter to find out about upcoming events.Share your talent: We know the huge difference that artists can make for youth and communities when they give their time and talent. If you are an artist and would like to explore new opportunities to mentor youth and engage with the community-give us a call and we can talk about how you can support our community arts work.Be a Community Arts Patron: Antyx is committed to working with youth in Greater Forest Lawn and the North of McKnight communities in using the arts to make a positive difference where they live. Contributing to a community arts project is a great way to support the youth in these communities. Imagine if you could enable youth from Forest Lawn to create a sculpture for a new park in their community or help a group teens in North of McKnight to paint a permanent mural that reflects their connection to where they live in their own neighbourhood!Projects costs range from $2,000 to $20,000 and your contribution will help engage artists, buy art supplies, rent equipment, book rehearsal space, etc.Become a Record Producer: Support our newest initiative! We need resources to support a group of 8-10 youth in building the skills they need to record a CD with an Anti-Discrimination /Anti-Violence message. The group will work with Hip Hop artists, Poets and musicians, to write their own rhymes/lyrics, create music and beats and then record an album of the songs they write. The recording project will allow the participants to build their understanding of how they can challenge discrimination and violence, develop new artistic and technical skills and create a positive message for the community.We need $15,000 to engage artist mentors, cover equipment and space costs and produce the album. Let us know if want to invest in developing new young artists so they can share a positive message.Our Board Needs A Lawyer: Antyx is currently looking for a lawyer to join our Board of Directors to help ensure accountability for all our stakeholders by supporting organizational risk management and helping to insure all organizational obligations are met.We are looking for someone who is excited about our work in the community, enjoys working as a member of a team and can commit 6-8 hours a month.If you are interested in any of these opportunities please email: admin@antyx.org or call us at 403 444 0500.","www.antyx.org","richard@antyx.org","139265292RR0001","403.444.0500","Richard Campbell","330000","art perform artist theatr",20,0.0192502532928065,0.0131712259371834,0.0192502532928065,0.265450861195542,0.0162107396149949,0.168186423505572,0.022289766970618,0.0192502532928065,0.0314083080040527,0.0344478216818642,0.022289766970618,0.0283687943262411,0.295845997973658,0.0192502532928065,0.0253292806484296
"21",102,"Art à la Carte ","Our mom was in the palliative care unit at the Foothills Medical Centre for the last 5 weeks of her life in January/February. She had been battling cancer for the past 6 years. During her time at the Foothills, mom loved choosing the pictures that would be placed on her walls. One picture in particular really meant a lot to her  it was a picture of a polar bear cub in the snow. Her sister had stayed with her almost every night that she was in the hospital and she also fell in love with this polar bear picture. With Art a la Cartes permission, we purchased the picture and our mom wrote a special note on the back of the picture to give to her sister to say thank you for helping her through the last days of her time on earth. Mom gave her sister this picture two weeks before she passed away. I want to thank Art à la Carte for the impact theyve made on our familys lives.The Cityof Calgary is well-known for its vibrant arts community; the performing arts as well as the visual arts can help Calgarians to celebrate beauty, be inspired, nurture their feelings andenrich their daily lives. However, this is not the case for thousands of people in our City who are long term residents in our hospitals and care centres. Recognizing that the sterile hospital environment can be forbidding, Art à la Carte was created 20 years ago to fill this aesthetic gap, bringing a compelling and unique program of art and inspiration to patients in these centres.What beganin 1994 with a sampling of photographs placed on the wall of a single hospitalroom has grown into a collection of 500 plus pieces of diverse art that isbrought to the bedside of Calgary patients. More than 81,000 visits have beenmade to Calgary health care facilities by compassionate volunteers who offercomfort to patients, families and caregivers through the bedside art programwhich is a compelling and unique complement to patient care.","Art à la Cartes mission is to create powerful connections through the arts with the vision of being recognized as a leader within the Calgary healing arts community.To most people hospitals and other medical settings are frightening and uncomfortable places. This was certainly true for educator, role model and humanitarian, Patti Hronek, who spent the last year of her life at the Foothills Hospital bedridden and unable to move. Patti had a rare form of bone cancer that ravaged her body beyond recognition, but it could not tarnish her indomitable spirit. When a friend offered Patti a choice of original photographs to place along the walls of her hospital room, the sterile setting was suddenly transformed into a comforting and personalized environment. Surrounded by memories, Patti was able to reconnect with the fullness of her life as she prepared to die.Art à la Carte was established in 1994 as a tribute to Patti Hroneks remarkable legacy. Today, Art à la Carte has evolved as the only local nonprofit organization to use the visual arts to bring art, conversation, and joy to thousands of people in Calgary medical settings every year. Volunteers make weekly visits to the bedside of acute and palliative care patients, encouraging them to select artwork for their hospital rooms. Cancer treatment areas are also enlivened with virtual skylights, creative murals and pieces of art in an effort to help ease the fear and stress often associated with invasive care. The power of the art is transformative to the patients who experience it, changing sterile and frightening places into a more homelike environment, returning a sense of dignity and autonomy to individuals during times when they are feeling vulnerable and also inspiring those who visit the residents in these care centres.With more than 81,000 volunteer visits in the last 20 years, Art a la Carte is a master at using art to restore a sense of connection to the world beyond the hospital walls.","Art à la Carte has created a bedside program where volunteers visit patients in acute and palliative care. Patients are invited to choose the artwork that hangs on their walls and they appreciate the opportunity to select themes that are personal and meaningful to them including landscapes, wildlife, or travel destinations. Our programs have been enthusiastically embraced by patients and hospital professionals, both of whom recognize the profound impact the program makes to the experience people have in the hospital community. Patients also report that they look forward to the friendly and caring volunteers who bring the art - literally on a cart - to their rooms.In 2013 alone, 20 passionate volunteers delivered 893 hours of service and 103,444 patients experienced the power of art in healing through Art à la Cartes Art for Patients programs. This number increases exponentially with the inclusion of family members, visitors and caregivers - all of whom are equally inspired by the art.Art à la Carte is the only program of its kind in Calgary. The concept and delivery is so unique that other Canadian hospitals and hospices have created similar programs based on the Art à la Carte prototype. Both qualitative and quantitative research projects have been undertaken to identify the outcomes associated with program delivery and it has met with resounding endorsements.Currently, our bedside programs are offered at the following Calgary care centres:Foothills HospitalTom Baker Cancer CentrePeter Lougheed Medical Centre, Santuari HospiceWomens Health CentreCareWest Sarcee HospiceChinook Hospice(in progress)In Art à la Cartes innovative new program Create While You Wait, Art à la Carte, in cooperation with Tom Baker Cancer Centre, Wellspring Calgary and Cancer Bridges, has launched a brand new opportunity for Day Medicine patients to participate in individualized creative art activities while waiting for treatment. The Create While You Wait program is unique to Alberta and possibly all of Canada. The guided activities are delivered by trained Art à la Carte volunteers.Art à la Carte also brings inspiration to the hallways and common areas of local hospitals and care centres. Cancer treatment bays at the Tom Baker Cancer Centre have been decorated with over 60 canvases. Virtual skylights that bring the splendor of natures artistry into imposing radiotherapy rooms bring comfort to patients who suffer from claustrophobia while an 8-panel mural by Calgary artist, Doug Driediger, creates a tranquil retreat for oncology patients and staff. The Footprints Gallery was dedicated in 2002 and is Art à la Cartes signature gallery of dedicated artworks. It features 35 original paintings, prints and photographs. The donated pieces celebrate the memories and lives of past patients while providing Alberta artists with a unique opportunity to showcase their talents and provide inspiration for all who pass through the heavily travelled hallway that connects the Foothills Hospital and the Special Services Building.","Get Involved today!VOLUNTEERRead about Jim Krueger, one of our dedicated volunteers.deliver art to patientsserve on our Board of Directorsjoin a committeeparticipate in special eventshelp others to learn about the programCONTRIBUTEyour resources, time and talentsintroductions to potential community partnerssubmit a testimonial for our websiteBECOMEa spokespersonan individual donora corporate sponsorDONATEcontribute towards matching gifts programsprizes and goods for special events","www.artalacarte.org","framinghope@gmail.com","889052254RR0001","403.281.6131","Debbie Baylin","87424","cancer treatment care research",21,0.0794326241134752,0.024113475177305,0.0177304964539007,0.0326241134751773,0.026241134751773,0.049645390070922,0.0156028368794326,0.0326241134751773,0.0326241134751773,0.0283687943262411,0.356028368794326,0.026241134751773,0.194326241134752,0.0326241134751773,0.0517730496453901

"23",487,"Arusha Centre Society","Carol Sherwood, Arushas first staff person recalls We didnt start in 1972, but a couple of years before. Our roots go back to the Calgary and District International Development Society. Staff wanted to incorporate some development education into the publicity for local walks, and devised some innovative programs for young people to learn more about the split between the worlds rich and poor.Arusha takes its name from the Arusha Declaration, a set of principles drafted by the governing party of Tanzania in 1967 as a guide toward economic and social development: Inherent in this Declaration is a rejection of the concept of national grandeur as distinct from the well-being of its citizens, and a rejection, too, of material wealth for its own sake.It is a commitment to the belief that there are more important things in life than the amassing of riches, and that if the pursuit of wealth clashes with things like human dignity and social equality, then the latter will be givenpriority. Julius Nyerere, President,Tanzania from The Arusha Declaration , 1967Activities addressed by Arusha have included film series, discussions, and orientations for Calgarians volunteering overseas.By the 1990s, Arushas energy was focused on the Committee for Anti-Racist Education, One World Film Festival (that evolved into the Calgary International Film Festival), a resource library, work in schools, and a multitude of workshops and special events. In 1996, The Sustainable Calgary and Calgary Dollars projects emerged from Arushas work on sustainable communities. Since then Take Action Grants, a grassroot granting initiative, was created and supported over 100 citizen projects and Open Streets Calgary attends 50 events each year with environmental education using pedal generators, pennyfarthings, and bubblemakers!In all Arushas work, it maintains its commitment to address social, environmental and economic issues in Calgary.","For over forty years, the Arusha Centre has been a meeting place for community enthusiasts and activists working on Calgarys social and environmental initiatives. The Centre is named after the Arusha Declaration on global and community development announced in the town of Arusha, Tanzania in 1969.Calgary should not be known only for its wealth and high quality of life. More than ever, Calgary is connecting to urban economic innovation and sustainability. The Arusha Centre is a meeting place for community enthusiasts and activists of all types.Core programs, Calgary Dollars, Take Action Grants, and Open Streets Calgary connect and collaborate with Calgarians of all kinds. Complementary currency blends social and economic benefits for vulnerable Calgarians and across communities.

Sponsors include Sustainable Calgary, Sunnyside Market , Pages Books, Green Calgary, Thrive, and REAP.","Arushas programs are inspired by relocalization, the movement to live, shop, and celebrate all things local. Localization increases quality of life, economic stability, and is better for the environment.

"25",708,"Association for the Rehabilitation of the Brain Injured (ARBI)","Ten days after suffering a severe traumatic brain injury in a car accident, Lukasz doctors advised his family to consider removing him from life support. They were told that if he survived, he would remain in a vegetative state for the rest of his life.Believing he would recover, his family rejected that advice and refused to let him go. One month later, Lukasz emerged from his coma and spoke his first words: Mama.Working tirelessly on his rehabilitation programs over the last five years, Lukasz now lives at home with his family and is independent in daily activities such as dressing, personal hygiene, and household chores. He works out at the fitness centre five days a week, snowboards using an adaptive board and he is enjoying cooking again.Lately hes been developing his public speaking skills, too. He helped raise $268,000 for ARBI as the keynote speaker in our 2011 Sponsor Our Survivors Breakfast. He has spoken to doctors and nurses at the Foothills Trauma Unit. Most recently, Lukasz gave his first speech at the PARTY Program (Preventing Alcohol and Risk Related Trauma in Youth), teaching kids about making safe choices.Last year, Lukasz was featured in a national TELUS Campaign, Empowering a Generation of Opportunity.","We unite professionals, volunteers and caregivers throughout Alberta to provide personalized rehabilitation and community integration.We believe that every client and every family deserves to have hope for the future.

Survivors will have goals that are meaningful to them and unique to their circumstances. This is why ARBIs service model, made of three main components, is highly successful.The On-site program includes both individual and group activities that range from intensive rehabilitation to social and emotional support. Depending on the severity of the injury, initial goals may vary from learning how to swallow or speak, to long-term goals that may include planning a day trip, volunteering in the community or moving back home with loved ones.The Outreach program offers personalized rehabilitation programs, for people with severe brain injury and stroke, carried out in their place of residence or in their community.Community integration and acceptance is critical to improving survivors self-esteem and quality of life. In the Community Integration Program, clients participate in weekly leisure or volunteer activities either individually or in groups.","ARBI is a grassroots organization built on the strength of the community and we continue to look for community members to help us achieve our mission.

"26",232,"Autism Aspergers Friendship Society of Calgary","The Autism Aspergers Friendship Society (AAFS) was founded in 2004 when a group of families saw a gap in service; their kids with Autism (ASD) were enduring stressful days; nothing but school and therapy. They were told by doctors their kids needed Recreation and Social time but these services didnt exist.We asked a simple question: when did these kids get a chance to just BE Kids!  Let me tell you about one of our membersAnton.He was 13 when we met and was a high needs individual with Autism. Anton had little awareness of safety, limited communication, and many sensory issues which made the world a scary place; For Anton and thousands of others with Autismthe community is a place of unknown and unpredictable obstacles.There is a misconception that individuals with Autism cant have or dont want friends and relationships...that is dead wrong! They want friendships, they want experiencethey just need support in making these things possible; whats missing for them? Opportunity...and thats where AAFS come in.Over the years, through experiential learningplaces that once invoked fear and anxiety in Antonbecame places of triumph. Environments once thought impossible; like the Saddledome; became places Anton could not imagine his life without.Our mission and vision are simpleCommunity, Acceptance, Respect, Experience and Social Dynamicsif we provide these things, our members will be as happy as anyone, anywhere, anytime. When we were founded in 2004we supported 7 families todayover 600.Through a feasibility study conducted by Social Venture Partners, we have identified there are nearly 50,000 individuals with Autism living in the Alberta, a number that is rising all the time.In November 2011, 14 year old boy with Autism won 2 tickets to a Flames game. When asked who he would like as his aide for the gamehe asked if Anton could take him. That night was Antons first night of many as a mentor in our Community. Anton is now 22 and is a leader and a role model in our community. He has won an Autism Community Award for leadership and is currently in the Broadcasting program at Mount Royal.We have hundreds of story like Antons and with your supportwe will have thousands.","When we started in 2004, we provided 2 simple activities per week; one weeknight and one on weekends. On the weeknights, we would meet at the Autism Calgary office and rotate nights between Video Game, Board and Card Games and Art nights. On the weekends, we would do things like swimming, bowling and movies...our focus was on getting kids out together with like minded people and having some fun.Over the years, we have significantly increased the scope and reach of our activities because our members would say things like; I want to make a movie, I want to learn how to design Video Games , I want to go to a Monster Truck Show , I want to go on a real camping trip.So we began to do what ever it was our members asked for. It was important to us that anything we started to do was because a member of ours asked for it and that nobody else was doing it.We have always operated from a very simple base; bring youth together, empower them, accept them, allow them to take risks and learn naturally whenever possible. As much as the adult world wants to structure how young people learn certain things, EVERYONE learns how they learn.","AAFS ProgramsCommunity OutingsWhen AAFS began, one of our main goals was to immerse our kids in the community around us. Over the years, AAFS members have had a chance to do everything there is to do recreation wise in the Calgary area. The Community is the largest classroom in the world and AAFS takes full advantage.A Community Outing can be anything out in the community: swimming, bowling, Flames/Hitmen/Stamps games, Laser Quest, Paintball, Sledding, Skating. anything!Clubhouse NightsClub nights are evenings at the AAFS office. On Club Nights, many important lessons are learned. Turn Taking, Sportsmanship, Sharing, Hanging Out (yes we were told by one of our youth that how to just hang out was definitely a skill he needed to learn). These nights are on a more drop in basis and rotate through our schedule according to requests from our members.Here are some examples of popular club night activities;Video GamesBoard GamesArt ClubCooking ClubMusic ClubYou Tube Club (making YouTube Videos!)Anime ClubComic Book NightMovie Night (watching Movies!)Specialized ProgramsAAFS Specialized Programs are programs that take place over 8- 14 weeks with a specific focus. These programs are an opportunity to engage our youth in their special interests and present an opportunity for possible future vocations.Some examples of our specialized programs are:Movie Project12-18 youth with ASD collaborate on the writing, filming, editing, acting and everything else to do with movie making. We are just beginning AAFS Movie Project V. Over the past 4 years, our youth have taken us into a world of vampires withAmulet of Dracul, been sucked inside a Video Game world with6- The Movie, watched a group of misfits save the world from a Supersonic Fart in2012- A Fart Odysseyand watched a group of students become Super Heroes inThe HeroInitiative: Unexpected HeroesArt in ActionArts based self-advocacy. An amazing program in which youth with ASD come together and identify various challenges they face as a community and then use the Arts to express and advocate for themselves. Art in Action is in its 8th year.Outdoor PursuitsEach year (April thru October) - we take groups of 25 youth on a number of camping trips in traditional camping style. They set up the tents, cook their own food, go fishing and hiking, light fires and do everything on must do when camping. One of our youth when asked why he enjoyed our camping trips so much said, Because I get to go camping. I am not going to a camp.Buddy Club Intentional Mentorship ProgramAn avenue for our members (youth with ASD) to start volunteering once they become comfortable enough with their social world and during this volunteer time, mentor them on what it takes to become a staff member at AAFS and eventually move them to staff. We just recently hired our 8th former member to come on staff. We are extremely proud of this because as much of the ASD community is trying to find ways to find people with ASD employment, very few (if any) are actually employing anyone with ASD.The Buddy Club is a volunteer program that allows youth and young adults the opportunity to volunteer their time and help assist the Autism Aspergers Friendship Society of Calgary (AAFS) in respite activities in the community, the clubhouse, and around the office. The program receives its title from one of our oldest members who has basically grown up in AAFS and lovingly refers to staff as his buddies. The idea of being a buddy or friend to children, youth, and young adults within the autism spectrum is at the core of the volunteer program.GO GroupA purely recreation/social program for adults who do not qualify for PDD funding. Once a week, participants meet up and decide on a group activity to do in the community. We run GO Group in partnership with CASS and Autism Calgary.Social DynamicsThe Social Dynamics program is a partnership between Sociallogic and the Autism Aspergers Friendship Society.The Social Dynamics Discovery Program is designed for individuals, ages 10  30 years, who may be struggling with or are looking to improve their social awareness. The Program builds upon a foundation of forming and maintaining relationships with others, fostering personal development, improving self-esteem, networking, and interacting with the world around us.The Program will create an immersive environment, activating the 5 senses to explore the concept that the expression of human life falls along many spectrums, and that all humans are different from one another. Solidarity in uniqueness can dissolve the barriers of social inhibition, promote positive outlets for creative self-expression, and enhance the sense of community and wellbeing we feel within our everyday circles and in new social situations.The AAFS Film ClubThe AAFS Movie Project has been running for 5 years and a number of our members have become talented storytellers, camera operators, film editors and producers. The Film Club will give experienced members of the Movie Project the opportunity to use those skills and gain valuable work experience. The Film Club will be an avenue for them to market themselves and learn about the industry.The AAFS Film Club can be hired out for your event, documentary or any film project.Video Game DesignThe course is taught and developed by a young lady with Aspergers and Tourettes who works in the Game Design field. Youth in the program learn the basics of Video Game Design and also have the opportunity to learn about marketing, collaborating to build a game and eventually how to sell their games.AAFS Photography ProgramJoin AAFS at the Ability Hub to meet new people, have some fun, and learn all about the basics of photography and beyond! This specialized program is action packed with a ton of tips and tools to help you to develop your photographic eye.At the end of the eight week course you will be asked to choose your favorite photos taken throughout the program. The group will work together to create a photo album for everyone keep and share with their family and friends.Extreme Sports- Skateboarding, Parkour, Rock ClimbingIf you are a bit of an extremist when it comes to sports, then you will love these programs! Join AAFS and some amazing guests to learn extraordinary new skills. We offer an amazing skateboarding program, paired with our friends from Calgary Association of Skateboard Enthusiasts, to teach you some skateboarding basics, and for those more advanced some fancy tricks!We also have a new Parkour program; which is the art of movement involving running, jumping, climbing, vaulting, rolling, flipping and much much more! The Parkour program will be facilitated through Calgarys own Breathe Parkour.Rhythm and MovementLife doesnt provide us a lot of opportunity to get in touch with our bodies through movement. So often, in school or at work we are trained to sit all day and do the same motions.Now it is time to get out of this cycle! Come to Rhythm and Movement! A program that allows you to explore the way your body moves and find rhythm through dance, movement, yoga, meditation and music.Earn a Bike (with 2 Wheel View)Earn-A-Bike is open to bike enthusiasts ages 11 - 17 with all different backgrounds and abilities. Each week participants will come to the AAFS Clubhouse to work together to learn all about bike mechanics, teamwork and leadership. At the end of the eight week program each participant will go home having earned their very own bike lock, helmet and of course, bicycle! Yes... EVERYONE in the program gets a BIKE!Everything Art!Everything Art is an 8 week long exploration of many artistic mediums including but not limited to: painting, sculpture, tie dye, collage and much more!

This program will explore the world of Autism and the individuals relationship and understanding of the diagnosis.Get Off the Couch/Lets Get PhysicalA program to explore the world of physical activity and how an individual can Get Off the Couch! The overall goal of the program is to find ways to motivate individuals to Get Active and live a healthy lifestyle.Technology ProgramsBuilding on our introductory Video Game Design program, we are developing Tech Programs including everything for basic robotics to App development. We would love to host a Geek Camp in the summer of 2015 that would take advantage of dorms and students from a local trade school.Urban ArtsWhat is Urban Art? Anything you consider Art in a Urban environment. For our first run of Urban Arts, we will focus on the elements of Hip Hop: Breakdancing, Beat Production and MCing. Community Partner- Party Quest Crew, BeatDrop","How you can help!AAFS is a very small charity (in capacity...not impact!). We have only 4 FT staff and as part of our culture, EVERYONE spends time working in Program Delivery. We do not have staff dedicated to Fund Development, Event planning or Financial Administration (although our recent growth has dictated that we hire a Full Time Manager of Finance in early in the new year.As any charitable organization, we rely on a few prongs of funding so we can run our programs; donations, grants and fund development events.There are a few ways you can help out!1) Run a 3rd Party Event! Any 3rd party event can be run with a group of friends, in a workplace or within a family. Some example of 3rd party events are:Have a dress down day or a dress up day (ie- wear jeans on Fridays if you make a donation)take a % or $ amount from sales on a certain day. April 2 is Autism Awareness Day...donate a portion of sales on April 2!A family of ours just made a Haunted Yard over Halloween and asked neighbourhood kids to donate for entrance, they managed to raise over $500!Bake Sales, Yard sales and collecting empty cans and bottles can also raise a lot of money. An 8 year old from our program has been collecting cans and bottles and has raised over $2500 in just over a year!Suggest AAFS as beneficiary for your corporate Christmas party or Golf Tournament2) Corporate Donations!Many companies will match employee donations, does yours? Even some companies who do not have a donation match policy will match when requested by employees.3) Create a tail of giving in your community!If you are willing to make a $25 donation...that is wonderful! What if your brothers and sisters matched your $25? What if your cousins, co-workers or neighbours matched your donation?Challenge friends and family to give or to volunteer!4) Volunteer!We have many volunteer opportunities for community members.

"27",425,"Autism Calgary Association ","Biting into her burger she realized just how tired she was. Not just physically but in every way possible. Here she was, surrounded by old college girlfriends and out for the first evening in over a year and she felt like she couldnt even keep up with the conversation. Despite having looked forward to this evening for weeks, she had hardly said a word. It felt like her once best friends hardly knew her anymore.Michael, her 14 year old son with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) had started a meltdown just three minutes before she was supposed to leave and she had walked out the door with his screams still ringing in her ears and her guilt trailing her out the door. She just hoped that they didnt ask about Michael. Not tonight. Its not that she didnt love him with all her beingbut she just never knew what to say. When her friends discussed their own teenage children she never knew which was worse - having them forget Michaels condition and leave her in awkward silence or if one of them actually remembered and they all apologetically started asking about how he was doing. Should she just smile and say he is progressing well with all his multitudes of therapy? Its not that he wasnt progressinghe was. But that didnt take away the truth that as her friends teens were out dating, playing on sports teams and learning to drive Michael may never speak. They complained about whining and cursing adolescents but she longed for nothing more than to just hear his voiceto know what was going on behind those distant brown eyes. To ask him how he felt.----------She had been so skeptical of the local autism mothers support group but Doug, her husband, had pushed her to go. Joining the Dads group had brought him out of his shell so much that she thought it couldnt hurt to try the mothers group  but deep down she didnt even want to go inside. As she walked into the room and sat down at the big, grey plastic table she looked around in disbelief. The other mothers looked just as exhausted as she wasif not more. But yet they were chattering away comfortably with each other like old friends. Two were even laughing as they poured themselves coffee. As the support group started and the women began discussing their children, their families and themselves she felt her shoulders suddenly drop as she settled into her chair.She could hardly believe what she was hearingthese women got it. They were talking about meltdowns, therapies, hiring and firing caregivers, the guilt of robbing your other children of the attention they so deserved, the loneliness. She bit her lip. The relief was overwhelming","Our mission is to bring hope and help meet the needs of families and individuals living with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD):Speak: Be the voice of families and individuals living with ASDEducate: Increase awareness and understanding of ASDAdvocate: Secure and defend the best quality of life for those with ASD throughout their lifespan and their familiesPromote: Encourage the advancement of meaningful research and the development of effective treatment options--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------In 2015 we served over 1500 individuals and families to find information, support and a sense of community! Through family support (advocacy, information  referral) and peer to peer networking, ACA helps families and individuals become knowledgeable, independent self-advocates. Through Public and Community Education, ACA empowers the community through greater awareness and understanding of Autism Spectrum Disorders.Since 1992 we have been the grassroots organization in Calgary to empower individuals and families living with Autism. We have gone from zero to 10 staff and are now on the forefront of many exciting autism initiatives including employment programs, social policy research and are the lead agency for a city wide network of autism related organizations (non-profits and private businesses). All our staff are either parents of an individual with ASD, are a relative of someone with ASD or have ASD themselves. We pride ourselves on being a community of families helping families.Since our inception in 1992 the prevelance of ASD has gone from 1 in 2500 to 1 in 86 in Calgary. We estimate that currently there are 6856 individuals (of all ages) in Calgary with ASD. These soaring prevelance rates have vastly increased our demand for services!","To accomplish our mission we have several program streams and initiatives:1. Family Support: Autism Calgary works one-on-one with families and individuals living with ASD to support them and advocate for them in a variety of ways. Our Family Support team are all parents of children and adults with ASD who can help you navigate the school, government or service system and also lend a listening ear.2. Support Groups: We run many support groups such as Keeping It Together (Mothers of Children with ASD), Carers (Caregivers of adults with ASD), Aspergers Network Support Groups (adults with Aspergers Syndrome), Fathers Autism Network Support Group and the Biomedical Support Group (discussing and sharing alternative treatment options for ASD.3. Public and Community Education: Autism Calgary also hosts regular, complimentary workshops on a variety of topics for individuals and families and has the largest Autism-specific resource library in Canada with free access for all members.4. Peer-2-Peer Networking: With a variety of social opportunities and groups Autism Calgary strives to foster peer-to-peer networks for youth and adults with ASD. The Go-Group is for youth aged 18-35 with Aspergers Syndrome who meet weekly to participate, as a group, in the community at large. The Autism Calgary Choir is a social and recreational opportunity for teenagers and young adults with ASD to enjoy music and have some fun too. The Pokemon club is a popular group for youth and adults which meets twice monthly to play Pokemon cards and socialize in a safe environment.5. Employment Initiatives: Recently Autism Calgary has also become a leader in the Autism employment scene starting two successful initiatives to employ adults with ASD.

"28",334,"Avalanche Canada Foundation","Avalanches are our countrys most deadly natural hazard, killing an average of 12 people each year and taking more lives than all other natural hazards combined. Avalanche Canadas purpose is to prevent avalanche accidents. Our approach to prevention is through empowering backcountry users, including residents, visitors, adults, youth and new Canadians, with world-leading educational programs, innovative decision-making tools and accurate, timely avalanche forecasts.Here in western Canada we are privileged to have some of the worlds finest opportunities for winter backcountry adventure; free use of this spectacular wilderness is part of our culture and our heritage. But with this right comes a responsibility to respect the mountains and their inherent risks. Through training, research and effective risk communication, Avalanche Canada is leading the way in this exciting field.","We are a non-government, not-for-profit organization dedicated to public avalanche safety. We provide a safety net of programs and services to help backcountry users to make good decisions while travelling in avalanche terrain. We provide daily public avalanche forecasts for western Canada and we develop and coordinate public avalanche safety education, including awareness and training seminarstargeted for a diverse demographic that includes youth, adults, residents, visitors and new Canadians.Mission: To minimize public risk in avalanche terrain by providing leadership, development, communication, coordination and delivery of public avalanche safety education, warnings, products, and services.Vision: To eliminate avalanche fatalities and injuries in Canada.Values:We are committed to awareness, training, and safety for the general public and for all who travel in avalanche terrain.We are an inclusive and diverse organization that provides services to all winter recreation activity participants.We strive to ensure that all programs, services, and materials are based on accurate research and evidence.We engage in strategic relationships and alliances to further the reach of our programs and messages.We investigate to understand all factors that contribute to human incidents in avalanche terrain and support that investigation by encouraging research.We inspire people to safely enjoy recreation and travel in the winter backcountry environment.We value our staff and communitys collective strength, energy and leadership.We create a fun, healthy, professional, and sustainable workplace, and provide our staff with opportunities to grow and thrive.We anticipate and respond to challenges and changes with creativity, collaboration, courage and bold enthusiasm.Annual Report Highlights - 2016With 8550 students, this year was our most successful year ever in terms of student participation. Once again the AST 1 course is the most subscribed with over 7400 students, an 18% increase over last year. Traditionally, the AST 2 course come in around 10% of the AST 1 numbers and this proved true again with 780 students taking AST 2, an increatse of 16% over last year.Social Media is an essential toolfor sharing information about avalanche safety. We had a youth-focused Instagram account where we ran a photo contest for backcountry users under 25, showing images of avalanche awareness, training and backcountry planning. Winners received a shovel, probe and transceiver from Backcountry Access.We participate in a number of conferenceseach year in support of public avalanche safety. This year, we had the opportunity to share our work and collaborate with other agencies and here is one example in Killarney, Ireland. In October of 2015, Public Warning Service Manager Karl Klassen attended this annual conference, where he represented Canada on a prevention working group with the Internation Commission for Alpine Rescue (ICAR). ICAR has 87 member organizations from 35 countries and is the worlds leading agency on mountain rescue.Did You Know?Cameron Westhead, MLA for Banff-Cochrane, announced a renewed three-year provincial funding agreement for Avalanche Canada. Alberta will provide the national public avalanche safety organization with $250,000 annually until 2020. Over the past decade, half of all avalanche fatalities in Canada were residents of Alberta. And of all snowmobilers killed in avalanches, about two-thirds were from Alberta. The Government of Alberta has funded and supported Avalanche Canada since 2005. Avalanches are a natural part of the winter mountain environment but they are also the deadliest natural hazard in Canada, said Gilles Valade, Executive Director of Avalanche Canada. By providing backcountry users with science-based and effective resources, we are working together to prevent tragedy.Each year in Canada, about 8,000 people take an avalanche safety training taught by instructors licensed by Avalanche Canada.As providers of Avalanche Skills Training developed through Avalanche Canada, we are thankful for continued financial support for this important organization, said Len Youden, General Manager of Yamnuska Mountain Adventures, in a news release. This money will support regional forecasting tools and education and help keep people safe. See announcement at: Alberta Announces Renewed Three-Year Funding for Public Avalanche Safety","Our programs are internationally recognized and used as benchmarks by other alpine countries. Our most visible product is the daily avalanche forecast, delivered free to the public through our website at avalanche.ca and our mobile app. Our 12 avalanche forecast regions in BC, Alberta and the Yukon, cover close to 250,000 sq km of mountainous terrain. In term of geography, Avalanche Canada is by far the largest avalanche forecasting program in the world.Our forecasting programs also include:Regular blogs throughout the season, with videos, images and more in-depth analysis on snowpack conditions.Field teams in the South Rockies and the Yukon, gathering data for their regional forecasts. Based in Fernie and Whitehorse respectively, these avalanche technicians also do important outreach with their local communities.The Mountain Information Network incorporates our app and our web presence and allows users to share their own information and observations, which are then geo-tagged to a map on our main page at avalanche.caThe Mountain Weather Forecast provides users with the best publically available synopsis and analysis of western Canadas weather.Avalanche Canada has also developed a number of specialized services that complement the forecasting programs by providing users with comprehensive educational tools. This includes:Online programs, including an avalanche tutorial and our trip plannerAvalanche Canada Training courses that provide a standardized curriculm for recreational avalanche training. Some 8000 people take these courses annuallyOutreach events including Backcountry Avalanche Workshops and Avalanche Awareness Days. Communities across Canada participate in these events.Youth Education - direct delivery of avalanche education to students K-12. We also serve as a curriculum hub for all youth-avalanche related programs.The community benefit of our Public Outreach and Awareness Programs is clear. By building awareness and encouraging education, our outreach programs help backcountry users become informed users of our avalanche forecasts, arming them with the best information possible to make good decisions in avalanche terrain.","Our programs and services are provided for free but they are the result of significant investment; i.e., it costs more than $500,000 annually to deliver the daily public avalanche forecast. If you, or someone you care about, use any of these services,please consider making a $100 donation to the Avalanche Canada Foundation today. You will receive a tax receipt and your generousity will help to ensure that Avalanche Canada can continue to innovate and inspire.------Project Partnerships:Know Before You GoKnow Before You Go is a terrific new avalanche safety video and instructor resource, aimed at high school students. Led by our friends at the Utah Avalance Center, the video pulls in voices and education from across western North America. The project also included an excellent PowerPoint slide show to help instructors deliver the lessons. This was a great collaborative effort and we welcome the opportunity to help create standardized messaging across borders. This video can be seen under ouryouth programs.-----In the fall of 2014, we launched a new website, with a map of western Canada serving as our home page. You can compare at a glance the danger ratings of all our regions, and clicking on a region will bring up the complete avalanche forecast. This map forms the foundation for your backcountry planning. Our new Mountain Information Network gives you the ability to submit your own information and observations from your backcountry trips. These submissionsfrom either your smartphone or your home computerwill be geo-tagged and will appear on our central map, so our whole community of backcountry users can share information and help each other make good decisions.We are excited about our terrific new products for backcountry users, developed with the aim of giving you the best tools for travelling in avalanche terrain. From evening seminars to a four-day field-based Avalanche Skills Training 2 course, we have programs for every step of your education. Winter backcountry travel is a life-long learning process and Avalanche Canada is focused on supporting you on every step of this journey. But we need your help to keep our programs going.At Avalanche Canada, were immensely proud of the work we do and we hope you are too. Together lets make every winter backcountry trip a safe one.

"29",375,"BC & Alberta Guide Dogs (BC Guide Dog Services)","Echo has been a part of our family for almost a year and a half, but it feels like weve never been without him. Hes had a huge impact on us, especially on our nine-year-old son, Jason. Jason was diagnosed with autism at the age of three. He had no safety awareness and was having regular tantrums, each of which could last up to two hours. Public outings were stressful for our family, and we lived in constant anxiety that Jason may bolt (suddenly run off) out of our reach and endanger himself. When we saw a news story about Autism Support Dogs, we decided to apply.When we got the call that Echo would be joining our family, we were ecstatic. Jason has always loved animals  dogs in particular. He loves cuddling them and talking to them, so when Echo became part of our family, their bond was immediate.Jason has experienced many positive behavioural changes since Echo arrived. Most noticeably, his ability to express himself verbally has improved, and he talks to Echo as if they were old friends. When we are out in public and people ask us questions about Echo, Jason takes the lead to answer them. Additionally, nowadays when he becomes agitated, Jason has learned to soothe himself by hugging Echo. Even if Echo is not within close reach, Jason is now able to calm himself down by taking deep breaths and simply thinking of Echo. As parents, we take great comfort in knowing that wherever Echo is, so is Jason.The bond these two have is incredible, and this year it was even more evident when we took a family vacation to Disneyland. We were a little nervous, but with Echo by Jasons side, our anxiety was put to rest. The pair did great together throughout the trip, and we were so proud of both of them!Echo is a sweet and fun-loving dog. He loves to play with his chew toys and likes to think we like them too. Sometimes he comes up to us and teases us with them, letting us almost grab the toys and then running away with them. He also enjoys running around the backyard with the kids and going to the dog park to play with other dogs.Our entire family has benefitted so much from having Echo, and we are so very grateful that he has come into our life. Not only are we all a little calmer, but Jason also has a new best friend and guardian. Although the smile on Jasons face when he is with Echo is priceless, we recognize the financial support, time and effort that went into training Echo for this very important job. Thank you so much to all the donors, trainers and staff who made this possible. -Jason  Echo,Autism Support Dog Team.                                                                                            The Gubbels Family","Imagine being able to transform someones life with the gift of independence. That is what a professionally trained Guide Dog or Autism Support Dog can do for someone who is blind or visually impaired, or a child with moderate to severe autism.Take a moment and visualize the benefits these service dogs give their recipients on a day-to-day basis; increased safety, enhanced mobility, facilitated safe navigation and freedom and confidence to explore for blind/visually-impaired individuals.For a child with autism, increased safety, positive changes in behaviour, improved social skills, more predictability in social situations, increased security and support for the child, improved sleeping habits and much more are possible. The entire family benefits. Having an Autism Support Dog means being able to do simple things the rest of us take for granted, like going to the supermarket, the mall or the park as a family. In essence, it means being able to experience childhood, instead of missing out.Alberta Guide Dog Services is a division of British Columbia Guide Dog Services (a registered charity). Our mission is to meet the growing demand for professionally trained Guide Dogs and Autism Support Dogs for citizens of Alberta. Each puppy born through our in-house breeding program has the potential to grow up to change someones life.Although often viewed as a dog organization, BC Alberta Guide Dogs is actually an organization about people. When evaluating applicants suitability for Guide Dog or Autism Support Dog training, we see ability rather than disability. All training programs are tailored to the needs of each individual, which includes domiciliary (at-home) training in the clients familiar environment. While our services are provided at no cost to recipients, it takes two years and up to $35,000 to breed, raise and train one of these furry heroes-in-the-making. We are not government funded and rely on the generosity of donors, as well as special events and fundraisers, for funding.To date, 110 Guide Dogs have significantly changed the lives of their owners in a myriad of ways, including safe and enhanced mobility. Thirty-three children and their families, all of whom are living with autism, are enjoying the diverse and wide-ranging benefits of an Autism Support Dog. Overall demand for our services continues to grow rapidly and our goal is to graduate 220 service dog teams by the year 2020.In honour of International Guide Dog Day, we launched our movie, Birth to Retirement: Full Circle of a Guide Dog. The movie follows a BC  Alberta Guide Dogs Team, Rosamund and Guide Dog Rory and shows how our dogs are bred, raised and trained to become life-changing dogs. The movie is available on our website in closed captioning and described video - click on this link to watch: our movie.Some of the things that make our organization unique include:oBlind or visually impaired youth. Many guide dog schools insist a person be 18 years old before getting a guide dog. We were one of the first guide dog schools in the world to specialize in matching youths aged 13 to 18 with guide dogs, helping them gain freedom, confidence and independence as they go through high school and, hopefully, university!o Tenure of our CEO. William Thornton graduated as an accredited Guide Dog Mobility Instructor in 1980, founded the Canadian Guide Dogs for the Blind organization in 1984 and founded BC  Alberta Guide Dog Services in 1996 and 2002 respectively. He is also a Charter Member of the International Guide Dog Federation, an 80-member global organization, and spent 14 years on their Board of Directors. He is also an International Assessor for the International Guide Dog Federation.o In-house breeding program. We maintain our own breeding program so we can be assured of the quality and quantity of puppies being produced each year.o Two years of hands-on training. Our puppies are placed with volunteer puppy raisers for the first 14-16 months of their life to learn basic obedience commands and, more importantly, being socialized to every environment possible. At 14-16 months the puppies commence advanced training with a Guide Dog Mobility Instructor for a further 4-6 months. Around the age of two, the dog becomes certified and the pre-partnership stage begins.o Pre-partnership consultations. Our professional mobility instructors spend time through personal one-on-one visits with each applicant to assess individual needs, limitations, and desires. This thorough process ensures that we are matching the specific individual needs of the client with the most suitable dogo Full-time, one-on-one in-home training. Our mobility instructors work directly with clients for a minimum of two weeks upon partnering with the guide dog or autism support dog. Despite the higher cost of training clients from their home, we are committed to this model as it reduces stress for the client and dog, and increases success.o Post-match follow-up visits at three months, then annually, and as needed.","For almost 20 years, we have been expertly breeding and training guide dogs for blind and visually impaired individuals, and more recently support dogs for children with moderate to severe autism.It takes an average of two years to train a guide dog or autism support dog and requires an entire team of veterinarians, staff, trainers, and volunteers. We understand the profound impact our dogs have, and we take every effort necessary to partner the right dog with the right client.The overall process to raise and train a service dog includes:Breeding: We manage our own breeding program, giving careful consideration to litter frequency, health of the bitch and sire, genetics and more.Puppy Training: Once the puppies are weaned, they are placed with volunteer puppy raisers for the first 14-16 months of their life. During this time, they learn basic obedience and are socialized to every environment possible. We support the volunteers with our staff member (Puppy Training Supervisor) who holds on-going obedience classes and one-on-one visits and evaluations with them.Advanced Training: At 14-16 months of age, the puppies commence advanced training with a Certified Guide Dog Mobility Instructor for a further 4 - 6 months. Here they are taught more specific skills and are assessed as to suitability for placement with a recipient.Placement: Upon completing advanced training, the dogs are placed with a recipient. Our professional training staff faciliate full-time, one-on-one in-home training with clients for two to four weeks. Despite the higher cost of training people at their homes (travel and accommodation costs for our instructors), we are committed to this model as it reduces stress for the recipients and increases success of the team.After-care: Post-match follow-up visits at 3 months, then annually. We are also available as needed for questions, addressing any areas of concern or for further training.To date, we have graduated 111 Guide Dogs and 33 Autism Support Dogs. Our goal is to reduce the current two-year wait list for a professionally trained service dog. All of the service dog schools across Canada are dealing with a similar wait list.Demand for both Guide Dogs and Autism Support Dogs continues to rapidly grow. Currently, there are 1,200 Guide Dogs working in Canada, which equates to less than 1% of blind or visually impaired people currently having a working Guide Dog. Vision loss in Canada is expected to increase by nearly 30% in the next decade.The CDCs Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network estimates about 1 in 68 children have been identified with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). ASD is almost five times more common among boys (1 in 42) than among girls (1 in 189).Our goal is to graduate 220 service dog teams by the year 2020. To this end, we have increased our breeding program substantially this year and are expanding our in-house capacity to support these dogs through our training program within the year.","How can you help?You can help puppies grow up to become Guide Dogs or Autism Support Dogs  loyal, reliable partners for those who need them. But the benefits dont end there. Since the working life of service dogs is approximately eight to nine years, that means your support will make a difference in someones life for years to come.It costs up to $35,000 to breed, raise, train, place and provide life-long aftercare support for each Guide or Autism Support Dog that graduates. To supply more people with professionally trained Guide and Autism Support Dogs we need to increase the number of dogs in our program. In order to do this we need more funding.Ways to support:1) One-time or Monthly Donations: make a tax-deductible contribution any time of year.2) Puppy Sponsorship: follow the progress of a puppy from birth to graduation with regular photos and letters.Mom  Pups Fund ($1,000 gift).Support the care of a mom and her litter. You will receive a birth announcement photo of mom with her pups. Then, we will match you with a puppy from that litter who, from 8 weeks of age until approximately 2 years of age, will send regular photos and letters to you.Puppy Naming ($5,000 gift).Choose a name for one of our puppies. You will receive a photo of your named pup. We will then match you with a puppy from that same litter who, from 8 weeks of age until approximately 2 years of age, will send regular photos and letters to you.Adopt a Puppy ($35,000).Support a puppy along its entire journey to potentially become a life-changing service dog. It costs up to $35,000 to breed, raise, train, place and provide life-long aftercare for each dog we graduate. You will choose a name for one of the puppies and he or she will, from 8 weeks of age until approximately 2 years of age, send regular photos and letters to you!3) Bequests or Endowments: set up a gift in your will or establish an endowment in memory of a loved one.4) Life Insurance Policies: name our charity as a beneficiary; your premiums will qualify as tax-deductible contributions.5) Fundraising: organize a fundraising event or ask friends and family to donate on special occasions.6) Volunteer:Be a Puppy Trainer.

Our Puppy Raising Supervisor supports Puppy Trainers and the cost of dog food, veterinary care and other basic necessities are covered. Monthly training evaluations and regular obedience classes are required as is availability during the weekdays for these sessions.","www.albertaguidedog.com","info@albertaguidedog.com","891311763RR0001","403.258.0819","Trish Lund","450000","anim volunt dog adopt",29,0.0272536687631027,0.516247379454927,0.0209643605870021,0.0476939203354298,0.00838574423480084,0.0429769392033543,0.0209643605870021,0.0744234800838574,0.0351153039832285,0.0146750524109015,0.0193920335429769,0.0256813417190776,0.0162473794549266,0.0445492662473795,0.0854297693920335
"30",234,"Beakerhead","Those who attended Beakernight on the Stampede grounds last September were wowed by the flaming octopus, El Pulpo Mecanico. A familiar sight at Burning Man, El Pulpo made its first trip to Canada for Beakerhead 2014. It is an amazing machine: simultaneously threatening and welcoming, the product of junkyard/hoarder artists who are both serious and playful. Fearsome jets of propane flames at 2000C blast from each of El Pulpos eight legs and head. Its eyes alternately bug out and retract. No beak for this cephalopod; instead a fierce mouth with fangs. El Pulpo once was a 1973 Ford F250 44, but honestly, you could study it for hours and never realize that.Kids come up to it, look really closely and see things they are totally familiar with. And they realize that they too could build something like thisyes its fantastical, but practical too.At a distance its a powerful flame-throwing machine, the kind of art installation that allows you to warm your hands on a cool Calgary evening. But a close-up look reveals something much stranger. El Pulpo is covered within fact, is constructed ofodd combinations of muffin tins, aluminum pans, forks, pie pans and kitchen utensils of all kinds. Their ordinariness is their virtue. As designer and builder Duane Flatmo says, Kids come up to it, look really closely and see things they are totally familiar with. And they realize that they too could build something like thisyes its fantastical, but practical too. And Duane knows kids like that. He was one, creating mini-dinosaurs out of chicken bones atop a base of mashed potatoes and gravy at the dinner table.The thousands who revelled in the dancing, music, engineering, technology and, yes, propane consumption in the Stampede parking lot on that Saturday night were experiencing only onealbeit the most visiblelayer of Beakerhead. There was much more.- Jay Ingram, Excerpt from Alberta Views, January/February 2015Sometimes the worlds of science and engineering, or art, can seem out of reach. Beakerhead is for the artist and engineer in everyone. It creates fully inclusive experiences that encourage children, families, artists and engineers to see, touch, create and learn.Bright kids suffer at desks. Students, especially girls, get alienated from math and science, because it does not feel socially relevant. The full potential of future leaders is trimmed. Both teachers and students feel bound to silos of teaching and learning. And it follows us into the workplace, where the reward system has a hard time recognizing and supporting truly innovative problem-solving. It doesnt have to be that way.Teaching is not entertainment but is unlikely to be successful if it is not entertaining.       - Herbert Simon, Nobel LaureateProblem:For decades, we have been directing people into either technical or creative streams and yet, it is precisely at their intersection where ingenuity lives.Solution:Beakerhead.Corollaries: When you throw open the doors to science and engineering through a welcoming world of art and entertainment, a lot can happen. The core educational purpose leads to outcomes that are important to individuals and society.","On the surface, Beakerhead looks like a week of spectacular fun every September. But its more than a schedule of mesmerizing events: its a time and place where engineers show their creative sides, and artists get technical, where science hits the street, and everyone gets ingenious.Leading with hands-on entertainment, Beakerhead advances the understanding of science and engineering as part of everyday life  through art and culture.

Charlie struggled with the grief and instability that this brought to his family. He developed an intense anxiety, and had difficulties with school and personal relationships. Charlie felt alone, confused, and scared, and he craved the connection and support that all children need to grow and achieve more. The future did not look so bright for Charlie and then he came to Big Brothers Big Sisters and was matched with his mentor, Mark.Mark was a kind-hearted professional from Calgary who wanted to give back to his community. What he ended up giving Charlie was something he really needed  a stable, supportive relationship.Five years after first meeting Mark, Charlie would be unrecognizable to those who knew him as a child  at 13, he has grown into a confident, resilient young adult who is excited about his future and the possibility it holds. And Mark, who had been so touched by having Charlie come into his world, has become a life-long ambassador for the same illness that took Charlies little sister.Charlie and Mark will always be part of each others lives  nothing can undo the changes they initiated for each other.

I also managed to survive a house fire which ruined my home. However I remain positive and I am grateful to BOBHSA and for everything I have today. I know the power of reciprocity and kindness very well and I am extremely humbled to now be on the receiving end of such generosity. When my late husband passed away, I was left to start all over again, as I didnt want to burden my children. I needed to find a place that I could afford and in my search for a home, I found BOBHSA. I couldnt have found a better place to live, the rent is affordable, I feel safe and I enjoy all the activities and services that BOBHSA has to offer. I can finally relax. The low rent is such a special blessing. Being able to pay for your own home, makes you feel like a regular person and gives you that sense of dignity that every human being deserves. Every month we pay our rent with pride, knowing we are not receiving handouts, although being given that helping hand from BOBHSA makes all the difference. I cant tell you how joyful it is to be able to invite friends over for tea. I am very humbled to have a place of my own thanks to BOBHSA  everyone here is extremely grateful.------I thank God that I have a home to run to when I get caught in the rain.

We now serve a diverse mix of tenants at Columbus Place contributing to the strength and vibrancy of our community. BOBHA houses three broad communities; seniors, working poor and vulnerable recognizing that many tenants fit into multiple categories and that there are those in need of housing may not fit any category well. The average household income is $22,510 at Columbus Place and Principal Tenants range in age from 21 to 93 and there are three families with children under the age of 18.Low Income Seniors: In 2016 we served 474 seniors over the age of 65 and 31 singles under the age of 65 and housed 50 new households in our seven buildings.In Calgary there are currently 3,222 homeless individuals and 15,600 households in extreme housing need. Greater affordable housing capacity is needed to provide housing both to individuals who are currently homeless and to help those in extreme housing need.Since its inception in 1975, BOBHA has been providing affordable housing to those seniors most in need throughout the city of Calgary. BOBHA recognizes that the need for affordable housing stretches across our community and that seniors, those who are working full-time and those on social assistance can all struggle to pay market rents. In 2014, BOBHA opened Columbus Place in Bridgeland and opened its doors to low-income families, seniors and others in need of affordable housing. Fostering an inter-generational community wherein low-income seniors live next to families and vulnerable individuals promotes a strong and diverse community for our tenants.Bishop OByrne Housing Association is a proud Partner in the RESOLVE CampaignMaking Calgary a better home for everyone.www.resolvecampaign.com","BOBHA partners with community groups to promote social connections and access to community resources amongst our tenant.Here at BOBHA we recognize that no matter which community you live in, it is our responsibility to provide excellent housing and support to those in need of those services.Our Mission is to:Provide and operate non-profit residential accommodation and incidental facilities exclusively for senior citizens primarily of low or modest income and for persons of low income in the greater Calgary area.Provide the necessary supports to relieve isolation and loneliness and to assist tenants to live independently in a healthy and safe environment.Our Vision is to:Develop and construct more housing for our senior citizens that are in the greatest need, as we endeavor to provide the tools necessary for our tenants to have a positive aging experience.

This shared connection to our waterways ignores boundaries and transcends cultural differences. The Bow River Basin Council (BRBC) works to preserve these experiences, along with the balanced economic vitality and critical life-sustaining and ecological functions of the basin, for the children of today and generations to come.The Bow River and its tributaries bring us together as a community that shares this precious resource. It supplies water to our cities and towns, irrigates farmlands, powers hydroelectric generators and creates endless opportunities for recreation. Population and economic demands have increased dramatically over the years stretching the rivers capacity to its limit. As a result, the Bow is no longer available for further water allocation in the future.It underscores the need for cooperation and collaboration in a sustained response. With such competing demands on this resource, the Bow River needs a champion to flag this issue on all fronts and to bring all stakeholders together for collective action.The Bow River Basin Council is a multi-stakeholder, charitable organization dedicated to meeting this need.WHO WE ARE | The Bow River Basin Council was established in 1992 as an advisory body to the provincial Minister of Environmental Protection. Its broad mandate is to promote awareness, improvement and protection of the Bow River water quality, foster cooperation among agencies with water quality responsibilities, and provide communication links among governments, interest groups and the general public. The BRBC includes representatives from urban and rural municipalities, irrigated and dryland agriculture, as well as recreational, industrial and other interests, and First Nations people within the Bow River Basin.In 2004, the BRBC was designated by Alberta Environment as the Watershed Planning and Advisory Council for the Bow River basin inAlbertas Water for Life strategy.","We envision a future wherethe waters of the Bow River Basin are conserved and protected as a fragile and unique resource, and recognized as our lifeline. Multiple uses are balanced, ensuring the needs of all stakeholders are met, while maintaining a healthy ecosystem.The BRBC has a vision of the Bow Basin as one of the best-managed watersheds in the world. To meet that vision, the BRBC forges consensus, advocates focused attention, promotes partnership on creative solutions and fosters collaborative action.The council has a broad membership base and prides itself on developing strategic alliances and partnerships with academic and research institutions, governments, businesses, individuals, First Nations, charitable and environmental organizations. It brings together experts, all stakeholders and collective community resources to formulate conservation plans and strategies. For example, it provides four Quarterly Educational and Networking Forums each year to identify, discuss and recommend priorities for issues and celebrate success of initiatives within the watershed in addition to weekly news bulletins and a quarterly newsletter.The council supports diverse study groups, grassroots stewardship organizations and interest groups for a shared purpose of conducting research  monitoring and developing  implementing action plansOUR MISSION | The Bow River Basin Council (BRBC) is a multi-stakeholder, charitable organization dedicated to conducting activities for the improvement and protection of the waters of the Bow River Basin, considering:Riparian zonesAquatic ecosystemsQuality and quantity of water, andEffects of land use on surface and groundwaterOUR PURPOSE| In the Bow River Basin, the Bow River Basin Council will:Maintain a forum for all Council members to share perspectives and exchange informationPrioritize water use management issues in the basin that may affect the quality and/or quantity of groundwater or surface water or riparian zonesParticipate in water use management and planning activitiesDevelop and recommend improved water use management procedures and performance measuresEncourage the implementation of cooperative water use management strategiesParticipate in activities that promote and demonstrate increased awareness of water use management issues to its members, the governments of Alberta and Canada, and the publicConduct and direct fundraising for the BRBCObtain and use assets and funds entrusted to the BRBC for benevolent, cultural, ecological, educational, planning and/or recreational purposes for the improvement and protection of the Bow River BasinReview and decide upon requests for funds and/or resources from the Council and others on the basis of the merits of the requests, availability of funds, and sound financial and project management principlesOUR BUSINESS PLAN | Click this link for the BRBC Business Plan","BRBC  BUILDING VITAL CONNECTIONSA river begins as a trickle and becomes stronger with every added drop of water.Nourished by volunteers, donors and staff members, our list of accomplishments continues to grow.

It didnt help that Deannas self-confidence was at an all-time low.But, her future was hardly predetermined. Inspired by a neighbor  a fellow single parent  who had decided to go back to school and was considering Bow Valley College (BVC) because of the financial supports for student-parents, Deanna enrolled in BVCs academic upgrading program  step one to completing her high school diploma. Managing classes, daycare scheduling and studying with a toddler at home wasnt easy, but compared to juggling jobs, for Deanna returning to learning was empowering!She was a strong student and her results, and subsequent awards, boosted her self-confidence. Strength and perseverance also came from the encouragement and tutoring support of Deannas BVC instructors. Their unshakeable commitment to her success and belief in her, helped restore her belief in herself, and made her unstoppable.Deanna followed up her BVC academic upgrading with a chemical engineering technology diploma from SAIT, then later, a chemical engineering degree from Lakehead University. So when she says that her return to learning cultivated a commitment to continuous learning, she means it.Deannas life-changing academic journey also elevated her resiliency and resourcefulness - strengths that now, through the Indigenous Speakers Bureau and other mentoring platforms, she strives to help others develop, especially Aboriginal youth and women. In her words, I am passionate about helping others find their passion; find their voice; and never give up!Bow Valley College helped Deanna Burgart re-ignite her hopes and dreams, believe in herself, and truly Learn a better living and Live a better life.

"36",731,"Bow Valley Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals","Blake, a shepherd cross, was found wandering near the highway in Kananaskis Country by a Park Ranger. He was limping, his hair was matted, and he was extremely skinny. When the Ranger called he came immediately, though slowly because of his limp. The Park Ranger brought him to the Bow Valley SPCA, and in turn we immediately took him to the local veterinarian for a diagnosis. It turned out that Blake was about one year old, had probably been wandering for about a month with no food, and had a severely broken hip joint. The local veterinarian said that he could not repair the injury to Blakes hip because the severity of the break and its proximity to the hip joint. However, the hip joint could be repaired if we took Blake to an orthopaedic surgeon in Calgary. The alternative was to amputate the leg.Our veterinarian presented these alternatives to the board of directors. He could amputate Blakes leg for about $200 or we could spend $5,000 to have his hip repaired.Our organization was less than one year old at the time and we had no contingencies for exceptional veterinary costs. We had established our organization as a no kill, and no cage adoption center, but until this moment of truth we had not considered the implications of those values and promises. The decision about Blake, made us confront ourselves about those values. The choice was between saving money with the result being a one year old, three legged dog, versus spending money we did not have with the result being a young healthy, four-legged dog.We decided that quality of life was more important than saving money and that we would find a way to manage the costs. This choice has informed our all of our subsequent decision making with regard to health. In essence, we want the best health care possible for dogs and cats in our care and treat them as if they are members of our family. Blake showed us what it really means to be a no cage, no kill shelter. As it turns out, we made a very wise investment. Blake went on to become a certified avalanche rescue dog. He even served at the Para-Olympics in British Columbia. Now retired, Blake still comes to the Bow Valley SPCA on a regular basis to work with the dogs that need a calm canine friend. Blake has taught us what is means to Pay it forward. ","The Carla Cumming Sojonky Adoption Centre, home of the Bow Valley SPCA, is Canadas first no kill, no cage adoption centre. For 10 years we have provided the best possible care for abandoned dogs and cats in the Bow Valley. Each animal in our care lives in a room, is treated as an individual, and is kept until matched to its forever family. Our costs are higher, but so is our save rate which is over 98%.Our No Kill, No Cage PhilosophyOur animals are housed in rooms (not kennels or cages) and we are committed to keeping and caring for every one of these dogs and cats until they find their forever family. Adoption is our goal, but in cases where finding a match is difficult, we are committed to keeping the dog or cat in our care until there is a match. As a no kill adoption center, we are committed to training and rehabilitating all of our residents until they can be successfully adopted and, if necessary, to provide a lifetime sanctuary for dogs or cats that cannot be adopted. The quality of life, while the dogs and cats are being rehabilitated is a critical issue. The no cage concept is an essential part of the emphasis we put on our residents having the highest quality of life possibleand we know it works.Our Facility - The Carla Cumming Adoption CentreNamed in honor of Frank Sojonkys wife, the Carla Cumming Sojonky Adoption Centre is a 3,500 square foot building with a large off-leash park, wooded walking trails, and a secure fence line. The Centre opened in June 2007 and was recognized by Natural Resources Canada as energy efficient in design. Green buildings are of higher quality, last longer, and cost less to operate; the long-term financial savings are significant, especially for a non-profit organization where every dollar matters. We are proud that our building is a home that respects the health and well being of both its occupants and the environment, while creating an excellent model for future adoption centres across the country.Since 2008, we have:Saved over 1,300 dogs and cats, with our save rates being 99% for dogs and 98% for cats.Matched 99% of our animals with forever homes.Helped re-home dogs and cats from surrounding adoption centres, which has strengthened relationships between other rescue organizations and moving us towards a no-kill nation.Provided a low-cost spay/neuter program to support low-income families in the Bow Valley.Provided educational outreach emphasizing responsible pet ownership and the importance of neutering pets which has reached hundreds of school children and adults.Sponsored a number of fundraising events that have enjoyed broad and consistent community support.Partnered with other community groups such as Wild Smart, Pats for Pets, First Responders, and several local businesses to promote animal welfare.Our 2016 Results:Between 100 and 200 people visited our adoption centre every week looking at and interacting with adoptable dogs and cats.Over 33,000 people visited our web site in 2016. More than 80% of these visits were made by Albertans.","The Bow Valley SPCA providesspay/neuterprocedures for a small donation (or free in some cases) to qualified families in the Bow Valley, surrender services if a pet owner can no longer keep the animal and a lost and found program in the community.Animal TrainingWe are currently focusing on improving our training for dogs and cats with complex behavioural issues--something we and other shelters are seeing more and more of. Our objective is to reduce the time dogs and cats are in our adoption centre and get them into their forever homes as quickly as possible. This will reduce the stress even a no cage environment creates, and will allow us to accept and re-home more dogs and cats on an annual basis.Humane EducationOutreach to elementary schools in the Bow Valley teaching pet responsibility and humane treatment of animalsTeaching youth volunteers to model and teach pet responsibility and humane treatment of animalsLow cost young dog socialization classesTraining for families with difficult petsAffordable spay/neuter programs for low income families in the Bow ValleyEducational seminars including first aid for pets, pet nutrition, medicating your pet, the importance of socialization, and safe pet handlingSeminars and WorkshopsOut educational seminars for individuals and rescue groups are designed for adults and use an adult education model. We cover a variety of topics from pet first aid to teaching brain games for dog owners.","$25 provides shelter, food, meds and loving care for one dog or one cat for one day. Help us, help them, every day of the year. The fees we charge for surrender and adoption cover less than 15% of our operational costs. The remainder comes from donations, grants and fundraising events. DONATE: We need operational funding. Operating a no kill and no cage adoption centre is expensive, and this is likely part of the reason we are the only one in Canada. We have a very low overhead because our centre was designed to be efficient and has been designated as such by Natural Resources Canada. This means that nearly 90% of donations we receive go to direct care of the animals.There are four different areas you can donate to:Public Education Program: Open Paws Training for the community, plus on-going outreach and education to students in the Bow Valley and beyond. Our mission is to create a compassionate and caring community and reduce homelessness for dogs and cats.Cinderella Program: Contributions support our spay/neuter program, plus all medical and training needs  for the cats and dogs who come under our care. It also permits us to take extraordinary measures when needed to care for special medical, surgical and behavioural issues.BVSPCA For Life Undesignated Fund: Contributes to the costs associated with fostering and adoption of animals plus the on-going expenses to operate our Society and adoption centre.BVSPCA For Life Endowment: This endowment program will ensure the the long term sustainability of the Bow Valley SPCA.Other ways to donate:Donate a carWish List of items needed at the shelterVOLUNTEER:Volunteer time provides the equivilent of 5 full time employees.

In the fall of 2014, Matts youth worker encouraged him to join a weekly after school leadership program at the Boys and Girls Clubs 5th Avenue location so that he could continue to expand the skills he was developing in a respectful and inclusiveenvironment.Matts confidence continued to grow through the friendships he was forging and the encouragement he was receiving from the youth worker. This once quiet and shy individual was gradually coming out of his shell and emerging as a confident young man.

The Boys  Girls Club of Cochrane  Area has initiated a community program for homeless and vulnerable youth in Cochrane termed Safe Couch Program. Youth homelessness is generally a hidden issue in Cochrane as these youth tend to couch surf or stay with friends for short periods of time, with an estimated 25 youth homeless in Cochrane on any given day.Our Safe Couch Program is modelled closely after a program in Victoria, BC that has been active for over 20 years. Families with an extra bedroom are contracted to provide shelter to youth in their homes for various lengths of time. Safe Couch families are provided funding to defer the costs of having a youth stay in their home, as well as a respite worker or a respite home when breaks or holidays are needed. Each Safe Couch family will provide meals, a safe and healthy place to live and help guide the self-directed path of each youth with the support of community resources.During this time of stability, each youth will work with the Youth Housing Liaison and community agencies on a self-directed plan. This plan is youth driven and may include any of the following: family re-integration, completing school, full or part-time employment, drug and alcohol counselling, mental health support, communication skills or career readiness.The program is currently funded by the Government of Canada Homelessness Parterning Strategy and by Alberta Human Services. This funding supports one operating Safe Couch family and the ability to support respite care for this family. You can help support additional homeless or vulnerable youth through donations or by becoming a Safe Couch family.

She was harming herself in the form of cutting, was dating a drug dealer twice her age, and never went home because her relationship with her mother was strained and dysfunctional. She sank into depression over how hopeless her life was, but somewhere deep inside she realized she wasnt ready to give up on herself.Jo searched for hope and found Boys and Girls Clubs of Calgarys Hera program for girls experiencing or at risk of sexual exploitation. She explains, I signed up with the intention of being able to finish school, but ended up getting so much more. Before Hera, I never felt safe enough to admit when I wasnt okay. I buried my pain to try and protect myself. At Hera, I decided I wanted to be a strong, nurturing person who does good in the world.Heras holistic approach to wellness taught Jo how to take care of herself, give back to her community, and make positive life choices. Thanks to Hera, Jo was also introduced to Havens Way, BGCCs youth housing program for young women, where she was embraced as part of the Havens Way family. I made friends, I learned to cry, laugh, love and trust. I am so grateful for what I have, and I owe so much of that gratitude to Boys and Girls Clubs of Calgary. I hope that everyone can see the value in kids that seem beyond reach or troubled, because there is something there worth saving.Although Jo has completed high school, is working now, and has moved out of Havens Way... you can still find her there giving back, spending time with the girls and staff, doing the simple things we sometimes take for granted like carving pumpkins or just hanging out together. To Jo, Havens Way will always be her home, and leaving when she did was part of her healing process.That doesnt mean the doors are closed for me, says Jo. It means they can open again for someone else...I will never forget my time there because it was a lifeline when I was drowning in darkness.​...because every single kid counts.​","Every single kid needs hope for what the future holds...For over 75 years, Boys and Girls Clubs of Calgary has carried on a tradition of helping young people to discover, develop and achieve their full potential as adults, citizens and leaders, by engaging them in activities that challenge and enrich their minds, bodies and spirits and nurture their self-esteem.

"39",813,"Branch Out Neurological Foundation","Back in 2005, only months after learning I was an early hopeful for the2010 Olympicsspeed skating team, I received another piece of news that would change my life forever.At 19 years old, I wasdiagnosed with multiple sclerosis, a degenerative neurological disorder with no cure. I was also told I would probably never speed skate again.With that determination of an elite athlete, invincible teenage mindset and after several months of therapy, I found the strength to tie up my skates and start competing again. Although I could skate again, I had another major relapsein 2006 and again in 2009 when I was told my disease was progressing and I would become wheelchair bound in the coming years. After receiving this news and trying 5 years of drug therapies with harsh side effects and littleto no impact on my disease, I decided to take a different, more natural approach by going off of my drug therapy and focusing on nutrition, herbal medicine, massage and other integrative approaches towards rebalancing my nervous system.Not only did I feel better, but it made sense to me. 8 months after I went went off my drugs I came 6 spots off the Canadian Olympic team and 8 years later I am thriving with health, and am relapse/symptom free!Throughout my personal journey, a few gaps became clear to me: a lack of high-quality research, credibility and funding for some of the more natural approaches to healing the nervous system.To address these gaps, I, along with co-founder Graham Daw, started theBranch Out Neurological Foundationin 2010 to literally Branch Out and establish a new and now emerging field of research termed neuroCAM (neuroscience + complementary and alternative modalities).Myself along with 100+ dedicated volunteers raise money through fundraising events such as the Branch Out Bike Tour and Snowshoe Tour. We have been attracting new donors and sponsors and partner with businesses who are all eager to join our legacy to establish Calgary as a world renowned center for neuroCAM research.This past June, the foundation hit its second million-dollar fundraising milestone. NeuroCAM is now an emerging field of research across western Canada with 50+ groundbreaking neuroCAM research projects underway. In the next year, we will co-host the first ever global summit focused on Brain Aging and by 2020 we are aiming to open the doors to a collaborative, interdisciplinary facility where the fields of neuroCAM research, science, tech, and business can serendipidously collide to help find innovative and alternative solutions for neurological disorders.I know thatneuroCAMresearch will help makethe future a little brighter for the hundreds of thousands ofCanadians living with neurological disorders. To this day, I never picture myself in a wheelchair and I dont believe that will be my future. Instead, I envision a future of a world free from neurological disorders.Thank youCrystal Phillips,                                                                       Executive Director, Co-Founder","The Challenge:20% of the worlds population suffers from a neurological disorder.There are over 600 different types of brain abnormalities.There is both a desire and need for alternative and non-pharmaceutical treatments, with little to no funds available.Impact:Since 2010, weve raised more than $2 Million for alternative brain research (we have funded tech solutions and non-pharmaceutical approaches to over 600 brain disorders).Weve accelerated the bench to bedside pathway by funding research projects directly impacting patients in less than six (6) years.Weve funded over fifty two (52) research project and have expanded our University Grant Program to partner with five Universities across Western Canada (UofC,UofA, UofL, UofS, UofVic).Impact Story:Pioneering the Use of Magnetic Brain Stimulation to Fight Depression in YouthDr. Frank P. MacMaster, University of CalgaryOne in nine Canadians aged 15 to 24 suffers from depressionthis is the highest rate of depression in any age group. Depression has negative impacts at home, at school, with friends and with family, and the impacts can be felt for decades. Unfortunately, front line treatments only work in about half of youth, leaving many ill and vulnerable to suicidethe second leading cause of death in this age group. Depression threatens their very lives. With funding from Branch Out, Frank MacMasters lab pioneered the use of magetic brain stimulation (TMS) to fight depression in youth. This novel technology offers new hope for those who are suffering and Dr. MacMasters work has helped spearhead efforts to bring brain stimulation to Alberta as a clinical service.Brain stimulation truly saved my life. It scares me to think of what I may have done if I hadnt had the opportunity to participate.                                                - Study ParticipantMusic-Motion App Helping Parkinsons Patients Walk BetterDr. Bin Hu, University of CalgaryWith Branch Out funding, Dr. Bin Hu and his team at the University of Calgary have developed the Ambulosono (or Walking-Song) app as a part of a larger program to help Parkinsons disease patients in overcoming their walking disabilities. For many people living with Parkinsons, the disease can not only dramatically affect their gait (the way they walk), but deter them from participating in social activity and physical exercise. Hus research discovered that brain circuits for music perceptions can help initiate and control a movement response. To use the app, patients strap the motion sensors to their leg and use the device to produce signals with their body movements that can turn music on or off. Freezing and shuffling steps stop the music from playing. After each walk, the app automatically sends the data to researchers who can remotely customize the program settings to ensure patients can walk safely with optimal outcomes.

"41",239,"Brenda Strafford Society for the Prevention of Domestic Violence","Betty was first referred to The Brenda Strafford Society for the Prevention of Domestic Violences Second-Stage Shelter program by a Social Worker at Alberta Health Services. She was fleeing an abusive husband androommate who had addiction issueswhile having the added concern of having physical mobility issues. The Centre provided her a safe place to stay while she received support for her trauma and assistance for her basic needs from compassionate staff and dedicated community partners. Her stay in one of the Centres shelter apartments, which is typically for a 6 month duration, was extended due to the housing issues that are occurring in Calgary as a growing city. During her stay at the Centre, Betty attended both individual and group counselling and learned to set goals and boundaries. She frequently commented how thankful she was for the friendliness of the staff and the security of the building. Betty became a stronger, more independent person and realized she was not alone. Betty told her Counsellor, I now know that I am a strong person who can say no, without feeling bad about it. Because I have respect for myself, I [am] given respect back. Betty now has sincesecured permanent housing for people who have physical mobility issues.Jane registered for follow-up services after completing The Brenda Strafford Society for the Prevention of Domestic Violences Second-Stage Shelter program. Jane, who appeared to be suffering from the effects of trauma, began counselling with no goals and little hope for the future. Over the course of one year, Jane, with the assistance of the Follow-up/Outreach Counsellor, slowly worked through her trauma, learned to cope with the trauma of past abusive experiences, and eventually expressed a desire to create a better life for both herself and her seven year old son. She created a number of goals for herself, including goals of emotional well-being and financial independence. With support from her counsellor, she was able to learn strategies to enhance her well-being, as well as be connected to appropriate community resources to assist with financial planning, and employment. Eventually Jane found full time work and now resides in her own residence, with an improved sense of self-esteem and confidence.","The Brenda Strafford Society for the Prevention of Domestic Violence, which we also call the Centre, is made up of 34 second-stage apartments;our families can stay for up to 6 months while receivingindividualized counselling and parenting support. We have well trained professionalswho not only care for the women but provide child care in a safe and secure environment.While at second-stage shelter, women are at the greatest safety risk. Nearly half of all spousal homicides occur within two months of leaving, making safe andaffordable housing, specifically for women and children impacted by domestic violence, essential.What makes the Centre so unique in Canada is our ability to move women and children from our second stage shelter apartments into our longer term apartments, which we call Progressive Housing, all in the same building. We have 51 Progressive Housing apartments where the women and their children can stay for up to an additional 2 years.Our vision is to provide flexible, accessible, low cost, secure transitional housing and support services for women and their children who have been assessed by crisis shelters  to achieve long term stability for women and their children who have been subjected to violence.We believe that by providing women and children with safe,supportive and accessible programs and services that aim to build self-confidence and self-awareness, long-term stability can be achieved and the cycle of violence can be broken.","Second-Stage Shelter ProgramThe Centre is all about discovering whats already in you; its there for you to learn about yourself, from yourself. - Former Resident We have 34 Second- Stage Shelter apartments which are safe and welcoming. All 34 apartments are fully furnished. While the majority of these apartments are two-bedroom units for mothers and their children, wehave 4 bachelor and2 one-bedroom apartments, allowing us to serve single women who are fleeing domestic violence.Individual Counselling: Trained counsellors are available to all women and children residing in Second-Stage Shelter at the Centre. The counsellors provide support to help residents deal with the direct effects of violence. In addition, counsellors assist residents in practical matters such as securing financial support, applying for educational programs or employment, and connecting with agencies in the community. Counsellors will advocate for clients if the need arises, in order to assist them in their transition from supported to independent living. Scheduled counselling sessions lasting up to an hour-and-a-half in length are offered once a week, with drop-in counselling available on an as needed basis.Group Counselling: Group counselling is offered once a week. Some groups concentrate on domestic violence issues, while others deal with parenting concerns or literacy skills. All groups aim to build self-esteem and create an awareness of the impacts of domestic violence for the women. These groups are all psycho-educational in nature and are provided in a supportive environment.My counsellor helped me see how courageous it was to leave the relationship and try and move forward. -Former ResidentProgressive Housing ProgramThe Progressive Housing Program is an affordable and independent living, consisting of 51 two-bedroom units. The apartments are available to women, with children, who have been impacted by domestic violence and are now equipped to be more independent; however they are still provided appropriate and adequate supports. Families stay, on average, up to 24 months in this program. At which time they are prepared to transition to the broader community. Referrals may be made through agencies or through self-referrals from Calgary and surrounding areas.Child  Youth Counselling ProgramChildren are often described as the forgotten victims of family violence. Though violence may not have been directed at them, the consequences of growing up with violence in the home have proved to have an impact on childrens emotional and social development. The Centre employs a Child and Youth Counsellor who meets with all the children residing in Second-Stage Shelter at the Centre to provide individual counselling, group counselling and family support. The Child and Youth Counsellor also provides referrals for clinical counselling and other support services.Child Care Program Child care is available onsite to children at the Centre. Open Monday to Friday and offered in morning, afternoon, and evening. Activities are planned and healthy snacks are available. The Centre has two full-time child care workers as well as a team of trained volunteers.During the summer, we offer the Childrens Summer Activity Program where our child care workers plan activities and field trips such as Calaway Park, Calgary Zoo, bowling, swimming, Calgary Corn Maze, etc. This program is supported by community donations.Volunteer Program We actively recruit volunteers to support programming at The Centre.

The 2013 I Am Courage campaign focused on the Courage it took to leave domestic violence and to leave it for good. It celebrates and supports empowerment, confidence and independence. Courage means something to everyone. By identifying what courage means to you, you can empathize with what it takes to leave domestic violence.While the original campaign focused on women and their children and was very successful, the Centre strongly felt that the campaign must expand to represent the Courage it takes to stand against domestic violence. In doing so, the campaign has become more inclusivein order tobetter represent the reality that we all have a role in ending domestic violence. The Courage Campaign was so successful in raising awareness about domestic violence and the Centre itself,thatit has transitioned into a full year program.The I Am Courage Program includes the opportunity to book a Courage Speaker, who can share her story of domestic violence  talking about the situation she was in, the courage it took to leave, and the courage it takes to not go back, or one of our Courage Ambassadors, Barb Higgins and Michelle Morgan, who engage with audiences about what courage means to them.I pledge to have the COURAGE to stand against domestic violence; to acknowledge that abuse exists; to trust in my belief for what is right; and to be a role model. I am COURAGE.","Weattribute success to people getting involved.1. Join our digital mailing list!2. Consider donating your time to the Centre! Volunteers are extraordinarily important for the Centre.

"42",299,"Bridges Social Development ","We believe that building human capacity begins with human-to-human relationships; and that social change results from transforming relationships.We believe that it is through meaningful relationships that we have the ability to influence systems, and build human capacity that leads to positive change. These human-to-human relationships in essence become our leverage points for change. It is in relationship that we can role model, build confidence, provide guidance, increase meaning  purpose, offer helpful feedback to course correct, connect to opportunities, and navigate barriers all with the intention of unveiling someones potential; this potential is the root of possibility for positive change.According to Researcher Martin Smith, Trusting and supportive relationships are at the heart of the intentional change processOur relationships offer context for understanding our progress in our learning and change efforts and for realizing the usefulness of what we are learning.[1] - Melvin L. Smith. 2006. [Social capital and intentional change. Journal of Management Development,25(7), pp.718-731]Despite offerings of educational, training, or leadership programs, many youth in Calgary are struggling to create meaningful futures for themselves and their communities. Weve experienced programming struggles with low turn-outs, unreliable attendance for the course of the program, and minimal changes for the participants post-program. Bridges has come to realize that existing programs encounter challenges with engagement of youth, and follow through by youth participants in pursuing their goals for creating meaningful futures. We think that something needs to be done differently, and that looks like innovative bridging work. Our work uses a relationship-building approach that strengthens the investment of partner organizations in youth  young adults, as well the outcomes for youth as they navigate their individual futures.","Bridges Social Development offers training and support to build the capacity of youth and young adults. This work is carried out through an approach based on Bridges Unveiling Youth Potential program, which is aimed at realizing the potential of youth and young adults between the ages of 18 and 30 by supporting their leadership roles in building strong, resilient communities.Bridges works by responding to community invitations to design and implement programs that help discover and develop youth potential. All initiatives are co-designed with communities based on the concepts contained in our Unveiling Youth Potential approach. This approach believes in the potential of youth and uses elements of personal leadership, community leadership, and change leadership to encourage and inspire this potential into reality. In essence, Bridges Social Development exists to meet needs, or confront barriers that unlock the potential of youth and young adults. Many of our current invitations are with First Nations communities in the Treaty 7 area.First Nations youth in Calgary are struggling to create meaningful futures for themselves and their communities. While there are many offerings of programs that target First Nations youth, these existing programs encounter challenges with engagement of youth, and follow through by youth participants in pursuing their career and/or academic goals. Canada Bridges believes that the need for First Nations youth is not another pre-employment program offering, but rather a broader need for coordination, collaboration, youth engagement and ongoing mentorship that Bridges has the expertise and opportunity to fill. Our support includes intentional and active youth engagement, programming co-design and delivery, and long-term mentorship for youth and young adults post-program to support individuals as they navigate their way to school, a career or meaningful work, or community involvement.","What is Unveiling Youth Potential?Unveiling Youth Potential (UYP) is a youth empowerment program aimed at realizing the potential of youth and young adults by supporting their leadership roles in building strong, resilient communities. This program was developed out of our beliefs that positive social change is necessary for the world to progress in a way that is healthy and vibrant; and that youth and young adults represent the group that offers the greatest hope for this change as they go beyond societal, cultural, governmental and institutional barriers to enliven the wisdom of communities around the world. Furthermore, we believe that youth and young adults desire positive social change . . . in fact, their future may depend on it.What is Included in Unveiling Youth Potential?UYP is an approach to youth leadership training and development, during which the following components are integrated:Wisdom Storiesanswer the question of WHY you want to inspire change.What is it that youth participants are passionate about, and what motivates them? What is it that makes them believe they are the right individuals to lead change?Community Mappinganswers the question of WHERE you are going to inspire change.Participants may choose to focus on any community that they belong to, but they will be most influential in a community they deeply care about.Change Leadershipanswers the question of HOW you are going to inspire change.Unveiling Youth Potential introduces a leadership strategy called Gentle Action, adapted from a book of the same name by David F. Peat. Gentle action is all about introducing small changes that are sensitive, relevant, and culturally-aware.Social Entrepreneurshipanswers the question of WHAT you are going to do to inspire change.Unveiling Youth Potential teaches social entrepreneurship from a perspective of compassion. The goal is that youth participants would see themselves differently in relation to the world around them  that they would feel empowered to respond to social issues.What are the Goals of Unveiling Youth Potential?Bridges Social Development aims to empower youth to be agents of change by supporting the development of capacities necessary to respond to the conditions of their environment and meet situational challenges. Through the UYP program, Bridges Social Development supports empowerment by inviting youth participants to reflect on themselves and their communities  and the connectedness between the two  and then take action by responding to community needs or priorities. This process sustains the practice of praxis, develops critical consciousness and social competency to unveil, build, and sustain youth potential and capacity. Youth become agents of change as they start to take action, engaging within their communities whether by just simply being kind to others, being a better neighbour, daughter, son, mother, father, sibling, or by initiating a social change project. Developing the capacity to engage with lifes challenges and subsequently take action are crucial pieces of learning, and Bridges Social Development believes that every youth has this potential: to lead and/or support social change. Through this approach,the building of individual empowerment will result in the realization of healthy and vibrant communities.","Become a Mentor: Bridges empowers people by building their capacity and unveiling their potential. Our programming is one piece of this, but an equally important piece is the role that caring adults play in the communities where young people live and work. These caring adults become fellow life journeyers, and lifters who support, encourage, and believe in youth participants of our work. If you are interested becoming more engaged with youth in your community or would like to volunteer with Bridges Unveiling Youth Potential Mentorship program please join us for the upcoming training sessions.","http://canadabridges.com","info@canadabridges.com","883401507RR0001","403.978.6747","Kristin Fedorak","265956","youth volunt young adult",42,0.0277033065236819,0.0116175156389634,0.0223413762287757,0.633601429848079,0.0142984807864164,0.0840035746201966,0.0303842716711349,0.0196604110813226,0.0277033065236819,0.0518319928507596,0.0277033065236819,0.0142984807864164,0.0116175156389634,0.0116175156389634,0.0116175156389634

While Biancas family was working to settle down in the city and meet so many basic needs, Bianca received lunches at her school made by BB4CK volunteers. Volunteers gave a few hours of their time and donors provided financial support that allowed healthy food to be purchased  the community joined together to make a difference.The individual actions that brought a healthy lunch to a hungry 14-year-old have created lasting impact for Bianca, now a university student who volunteers to make lunches each week  and that action and impact are what BB4CK is all about. Awareness is such a big factor, but you have to act on it as well. Its not just making sandwiches, its making Calgary a better place, Bianca says.BB4CK works for Bianca and kids like her, making our community better via the seemingly simple act of lunch.Our Vision:Brown Bagging for Calgarys Kids has one goal:no hungry kids in Calgary.We strive toward this goal each day by providing healthy lunches directly tokids,and by empowering communities to create lasting social change.Our Mission:To work with Calgary schools to identify kids who are hungry and find ways to feed them.","To ensureevery student in Calgary has access to a healthy lunch, BB4CK works closelywith each school and school board in the city, supporting them to ensure theneeds of their students are met.Once aschool identifies that they have a need for lunches they inform BB4CK of howmany kids are impacted by hunger each day. BB4CK will then arrange to meet thelunch needs of these students.Some schoolswill receive lunch deliveries from BB4CKs Kitchen, located in downtown Calgary.The Kitchen is operated by more than 2,000 volunteers each year who cometogether daily to make sandwiches, cut up fruits and vegetables and bake snacksfor lunches. The lunches are picked up by volunteer drivers and delivered toschools each morning.Alternatively,the school might be connected to a community group via BB4CK that makes lunches perhaps a seniors centre, a church group or a company with a corporatekitchen. These groups may meet daily, a few times a week, or even once eachweek, making lunches specifically for kids in a school where there is need.Some schools may also receive direct funding and support from BB4CK to purchase the food supplies they need for lunch. Lunches could be coordinated by school staff orvolunteers, and sometimes students put the lunches together for themselves orothers in their school or neighboring schools. However theyreceive lunch, BB4CK works to get lunch to students as soon as a need isidentified. This allows us to ensure that every student in Calgary has accessto a healthy lunch at school.","BB4CK knows that every person has the power to change their world. It takes thoughtful, meaningful action  being willing to spend time, energy and resources to understand a problem and turn it into an opportunity. The BB4CK community focuses its energy on ensuring every student in Calgary has access to a healthy lunch at school, and we invite you to join us.Share the story!Tell someone the facts about hungry kids in our city and empower them to take action to do something about it  whether they are part of the BB4CK community or not. The more people that know about hungry kids in Calgary, and that they can to do something about it, the better.Give financially!The BB4CK budget is $850,000 each year, 100% of which comes from community donations  we dont have any government funding contracts. This means that the generosity of individuals, groups and companies  from 8 year olds who give their birthday money to national corporations giving major grants  ensure that BB4CK is stable and sustainable.Start a group!You can start a group in your community, with people joining together to make lunches for students in a local school.

All her life Celia had struggled with task completion, efficiency, organizational issues, and forgetfulness. Given the strong hereditary component of ADHD, her family encouraged her to pursue an assessment.After a thorough assessment process, including meetings with the psychologists and physicians at CanLearn, a diagnosis of ADHD was confirmed and Celia chose to participate in a medication trial. She immediately noticed improvements in her focus, clarity of mind, task initiation, task completion, and reduced anxiety.

A light splashes as the Elder pours water on the stones and steam slowly sinks into her skin. The only indications of the 11 others inside the hut are the deep, steady breaths and the calming words of the Elder.Suzanne, a tenant with Calgary Alpha House Society, has been attending sweat ceremonies on the Tsuu Tina reserve at least once a week for four years.Its the best healing ever. Theres something very maternal about it, she says. The lodge, a dome structure made of branches and covered in blankets, represents the womb of Mother Earth. When youre all pent up, it helps to clarify everything.When Suzannes husband was killed, she turned to drugs to mask the harrowing pain she felt with him no longer by her side. I didnt want to feel anything, she admits. I was broken.For 22 years, Suzanne was held captive by her drug addiction. After losing her house, Suzanne lived on the streets for six years before entering detox at Alpha House. I had some traumatic experiences, she says, but this place is a godsend.Suzanne started attending sweat ceremonies on the reserve with Alpha House. She found healing in other Aboriginal traditions as well, like fasting and sun dances.Alpha House is known for its Aboriginal programming which will be made available to the 30 women in its future RESOLVE project. Using both Housing First and harm reduction models, tenants will receive intensive case management and 24-hour support. The 30-unit apartment building will be close to womens and health centres as well.Having a home is epically important for women, and to be with each other to heal together in a safe place, Suzanne stresses. I know so many women who are stuck in purgatory. They have nowhere to go so they put up with abuse and sell themselves just so they can pay for a hotel room for the night.Its incredibly dangerous.The mortality rate for women experiencing homelessness is 10 times higher than the general population. And because they represent a smaller portion of the homeless population, their needs are often overlooked.The Womens Harm Reduction Facility will meet this need by providing a safe, affordable and caring environment specifically for women, with the supports needed to maintain the housing  this could include a female elder who would work with tenants.Kathy Christiansen, executive director of Alpha House, has attended many sweat ceremonies with clients. Connection to culture is essential, she says. It supports ongoing healing, and, therefore, housing sustainability, for many of the women we see in our program.Suzanne says that having a home motivates her to stay healthy. And just to be able to do laundry all night long is beautiful, she laughs. Its the best!One day, Suzanne hopes to introduce other women to the healing that sweat ceremonies have provided her. I want to be an elder. I want to pour water on the rocks, she says. For women.","The Calgary Alpha House Society was established in 1981 as a committed response to a marginalized population of men and women who were addicted to alcohol or other drugs and living vulnerable on the streets of Calgary.Alpha Houses values and beliefs includes respecting the clients right to self-determination as they address the impact of alcoholism and addiction in their lives.

She looked forward to a summer of fun, exploring her new surroundings, meeting neighbours and making new friends.However, as a child with a disability the desire to meet people and try new things came with its own challenges.Julias family relocated in search of better opportunities. Her parents immediate focus was providing for their family and Julias recreation activities did not take priority. They had received almost no social or financial support while adapting to their new environment, which put a severe strain on her family.Julia was facing the possibility of spending her entire summer without opportunities to interact with others.No outings. No friends.Thats where Between Friends came in... and changed EVERYTHING.This summer, Julia was able to attend Between Friends Camp Bonaventure for the first time, which had a profound impact on her life.Because of Between Friends and generous donors like you, Julia was able to just be a kid... and most importantly, feel accepted.She had finally found a place to belong.*name changed","Recently parents and caregivers from across the country were surveyed about their children with disabilities to determine the health, well-being and social inclusion of children, youth and their parents.When asked about the quality and number of friendships their child had, parents reported that one-third of the children have no friends even at school and over half the children have no friends outside of school.NO FRIENDS.Now imagine that you have a place to go where you are welcomed, where your interests are considered and you experience fun and friendship. Imagine the surprise when you master something that you werent sure you could do and others cheer you on while you do it.Thats what Between Friends is all about  a place to connect, a place to grow, a place to belong.

Our youngest participant is 3 and our oldest 68.For more than 30 years, Between Friends has been offering children, youth, and more recently adults with disabilities, a variety of programs that remove the barriers of isolation and truly function as the building blocks of friendship. We operate more than 130 programs in five program areas. We encourage inclusive program participation by offering program spaces for those who do not have a disability. Our vision is one of inclusion so that there are no barriers to participation within Between Friends and within the wider community.We are most proud of the work that we do with the community to educate them about including people with disabilities, so that they may participate alongside their typically developing peers. Ah, for society to be inclusivenow wouldnt that be something special.We are also proud of the young leaders that we develop. Through our programs, our leaders and volunteers not only learn leadership skills, but they learn how to be accepting of others who may be just a bit different. We focus on ability rather than disability and we focus on similarities rather than differences. Our leaders grow and develop into teachers, speech language pathologists, doctors, psychologists, occupational and physiotherapistsand some of them even enter the oil patch!The greatest accomplishment we can have is to have our participants develop their skills to the point that they can volunteer and even work for usand we have a thriving Volunteer in Training program and a service club for adults with disabilities, where they can show off their skills and give back to others in the way that others have given to them all of their lives.","Each program area can be considered a stepping stone for participants to develop more experience in connecting, growing and belonging.Between Friends Camp Bonaventure: a true summer outdoor day camp at Riveredge Park where friendship and fun flourish for ages 4 to 17.Between Friends W.E.S.O.A.R!: a variety of social and recreational group activities like bowling, swimming, movie nights and dancing for all ages.Between Friends Camp FunzAmust: a unique residential outdoor camp, run in partnership with Easter Seals Camp Horizon, adapted and accessible for ages 7 to 17  18 to 40.Between Friends Adventurers: a summer program for adults aged 18 and older that is customized to varied interests from city tours to mountain retreats.Between Friends I.C.A.N!: a program that promotes social inclusion by having persons with disabilities participate in community programs or camps with their typically developing peers at partner agencies such as the YMCA or Airdrie Genesis.

He ran out to find his mother, father and sister laying on the streets. His little sister died in his arms. It was the day he lost three family members due to rebel attacks on innocent civilians. Tears, anger, grief and shock overwhelmed this young teenager as he lay on the streets holding his family and crying. Nothing made any sense to this young boy and from that day forward, he knew his life had forever changed.When Adel arrived in Canada as a refugee, he was nervous and afraid. All he knew in English was how to say his name. His teachers saw him as a teen with behavioural issues. After a year in our programs, this young boy overcame his fears and went from being shy, lonely and confused to a confident, popular student. He has even won a scholarship and his teachers now see him as an ambassador for the school.Our programs improved his social skills and emotional well-being. We taught him the importance of helping those in need and he signed up as a mentor to immigrant youth who struggled like he once did. Today Adel wants to pursue an engineering degree because he believes education is the key to ending violence and staying positive in life. He feels he can accomplish this because of us.We help thousands like Adel each day. We also help their families. Some come from economically disadvantaged backgrounds while some are average folks that need a firm foundation so they can realize their potential and strat contributing to Canadian society shortly after arriving to Calgary.*The young boys name has been changed to protect his privacy.OUTCOMESWe are the only immigrant serving agency with a daily presence in the public and Catholic school board reception centers thus making it easy to access our services.In 2013, we trained 60 youth to volunteer as peer mentors to newcomers in their schools.We delivered over 2000 hours of free academic support to help struggling students improve their grades and graduate from high-school.Our multi-lingual team can deliver support in over 20 languages.100% of teachers surveyed reported a significant increase in newcomer engagement and involvement at school after students spent three months in our Mentorship Program.100% of youth in our Afterschool Program reported greater personal motivation and imporvement in their leadership and self-confidence.We deliver over 100 workshops on topics like employment, housing, banking, health care, child care and safety.We partner with over 40 community agencies to offer referrals for housing, employment, food, shelter, clothing and other services.","We empower thousands of immigrant and newcomer youth and help them overcome emotional, cultural and socio-economic barriers.

Many of these youth are new to Canada and experience loneliness, exclusion, racism, bullying, a confused self-identity, low self-esteem, etc. Our programs help these kids realize the potential that lies within each of us as human beings. Through a partnership with over 40 community agencies and both - the public and Catholic school board, we deliver support in schools, libraries or housing complexes with the highest need. We teach kids about adaptability, anti-bullying, self-empowerment, healthy friendships and positive behaviours. We also support newcomer families to they can establish a firm foundation that will help them accomplish their dreams and realize their potential.

We alsodeliver programs right where the need is.We are the first point of contact for any newcomer family looking to register their children in school. We have offices in the reception centers of the public and Catholic school board. This allows us to provide one-on-one support to newcomer families and to direct their children into programs that best suit their needs. We even meet with families at their homes during evenings and weekends.All our youth programs occur within schools, libraries or housing complexes in economically disadvantaged neighbourhoods or communities with a high population of immigrants.We serve individuals who are most in need of services. By us reaching out to them, we eliminate barriers to access and have direct access to newcomers.---Our programs focus on building knowledge of Canada and Calgarys culture and we tailor our support to youth and their families based on their background, experience, and level of need.

"49",445,"Calgary Catholic Immigration Society (CCIS)","When the Al-Janabi family arrived from Syria in July of 2014, they were excited about thepotential for a safe life in Canada. Then in December, they were given the devastating newsthat their 11 year son had been diagnosed with congenital heart defects. The response was swift. He would need open heart surgery.The family was terrified and contacted the CCIS wellness staff asking forsupport. The boy had many specialist appointments to attend, and the surgery wasscheduled to be performed in Edmonton. New to Canada, with severe financial hardshipsand a significant language barrier, the family was apprehensive about the entire process.CCIS provided a volunteer to accompany the family to all their appointments. We contacted Heart Beats Childrens Society in Edmonton to assist with transportation,accommodation and food. A social worker at Stollery Childrens Hospital helped to arrangeinterpretation and guidance during each step of the process.When we called the father after the surgery to check on the boys status, he commented:Idont know how to thank you for taking care of everything.

"50",446,"Calgary Centre for Global Community","In the summer of 2015, Salima Stanley-Bhanji and Eduardo Bunster travelled through Bangladesh and Jordan interviewing people and hearing their stories. They spoke with, and captured on film, 20 people, about half of whom are Syrian refugees. In Amman, they met people under the umbrellas covering a staircase on Rainbow Street. While they were at it, they collected the real, worn shoes of the people they interviewed.Back in Canada, they conducted additional interviews and turned the stories into an experiential and intimate film project in which participants are able to literally step into the shoes of another while hearing their stories. The interviewees themselves were also deeply impacted through our deep listening. The stories are rich, layered and diverse, and each connects the viewer with the individual in a compelling way, breaking down the barriers of time and distance, of language and culture, to reinforce the connection we feel in our shared humanity and to bring about positive change towards effective global citizenship.Under the banner of Humainologie, our Calgary-based production house, our films have been entered into and included in a number of film festivals, and we received a Rising Star Award at the Canadian International Film Festival in 2016, for our film under an umbrella we met | Adnan, which you can watch herehttps://vimeo.com/146502703.

Sports associations, arts organizations, faith groups, friends of the environment, and social service agencies are some of the many nonprofits and charities that carry out their missions with a passion for making life better for others.The Calgary Chamber of Voluntary Organizations supports the critical work of the charitable sector. We build awareness and make sense of the cross-cutting issues that affect the sector so that community nonprofits can focus on their missions. We want all nonprofits to be equipped to carry out their missions with excellence, which is why we work to strengthen the sector by offering the information, learning, and resources they need. Nonprofits also tell us they value joining with like-minded peers and others outside the sector to accomplish more together, so we tap into the reach of our network to help make those connections happen.","Our goal is to inform and inspire nonprofit leaders, board members, funders, and other nonprofit professionals in their day-to-day work. From research insights to stories of innovation, we promote a deeper understanding of the sector and encourage critical analysis of the issues and trends that shape the sector. When organizations understand the context of their work they can apply that knowledge to increase their own reach and effectiveness.We also work to influence key players beyond the sector, such as policy makers and funders, by sharing insights on the challenges and opportunities facing the sector. Charities play an important role in the public policy process; they represent those who might otherwise not be heard and they identify unintended consequences of policy decisions. This aspect of our work is based on information and knowledge, and is always non-partisan.Recent highlights of our success include:Advocated to have the nonprofit sector included in the provinces energy efficiency grant programs.Shared our expertise on emergency preparedness and response with sector colleagues in Fort McMurray, as well as at several provincial, national, and international conferences/gatherings.Reported a 10% increase in the number of Alberta nonprofits with an emergency response plan.Identified capacity strengths and gaps in the ability of nonprofits to carry out their missions.","Information and Research  We provide in-depth analysis of issues and policies that affect the sector. We scan and monitor for social, environmental, political, and workforce trends that affect nonprofits, and we report on the state of the sector in our annual provincial survey of nonprofits. Comprehensive information on nonprofit salary and human resource practices is also gathered through an annual national survey we conduct.Training and Tools  We build the sectors capacity in leadership, human resources, finance, policy advocacy, and emergency preparedness. Our workshops and communities of practice bring nonprofit professionals together for learning, growth, and networking, while our Reach Hire job board matches nonprofit job seekers with employers.Connection and Conversation  We engage and advocate the sectors interests on cross-cutting issues with sector colleagues and government policy makers.

"52",291,"Calgary Chinese Community Service Association","The valuable services CCCSA offered touch the hearts of many, it helps immigrant families integrate into Canada and become empowered to become citizens leading dynamic and prosperous lives:We care for our clients and support them through their hard timesMs. C started working at the age of 17 and taking care of three children at the same time. With little to no help from her husband, Ms. C worked very hard for the family and also paid off the debts that her husband had accumulated. The relationship between Ms. C and her husband finally broke apart.In 2000, Ms. C was diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder and had to receive treatment. In 2005, she decided to move to Calgary. It was tough starting off fresh into another country, she had trouble adapting to the new environment, she had a language barrier and was financially strapped. Encountering all these difficulties, she became depressed again and she suffered insomnia. Worse still, her doctor had told her that her spinal cord was compressed and that her 4th vertebrae had shifted.The physical and mental suffering brought her into deep despair, the feeling of being hopeless and helpless overcame her. One day as she was wandering on the street, trying to kill time, she shoplifted in a store and was caught and immediately handed over to the authorities. Actually, she was mentally incapable of making sound judgements, she could not tell right from wrong and she had no idea what she was doing.Guilt, shame and regret hit her and thats when she turned to the Calgary Chinese Community Service Association (CCCSA) for help. Through the legal clinic which was held in partnership between CCCSA and Calgary Legal Guidance, a volunteer lawyer explain to her about her situation and give her guidance on the steps she needed to take. CCCSA staff gave Ms. C. a lot of support including accompanying her to the court appearance and helping her with the necessary procedures to enter the Mental Health Diversion Program, where Ms. C went through a four month program offered by Alberta Health Services. Ms. C successfully completed the program, her charges were withdrawn and her mental conditions were properly dealt with.

The programs in this stream are designed to reduce barriers and promote an inclusive and supportive society where members in the Chinese speaking community have full and equitable access to and participation in Canadian society. CCCSA services are solution-focused and empowerment-based to support Chinese-speaking immigrants to successfully integrate socially, culturally, and economically within Calgary.Children and Youth Program - The objective of this program is to foster meaningful relationships, assist youth to build reiliency and develop positive social and leadership skills. The mission is to ensure that children and youth have an opportunity for healthy growth and development. CCCSA has established the following fun and inspiration programs to meet the mental, physical, and emotional needs of children and youth in Calgary.Law  Advocacy Program - This program was initiated with the objective of enhancing the quality of legal services delivered within the Calgary Chinese community.

"53",506,"Calgary Counselling Centre","My depression started when I experienced a lack of support and respect at my workplace. Each day was mentally exhausting and consisted of constant negativity, but I forced myself to go to work everyday. I began to feel worthless and alone; I was surrounded by people, yet isolated in my own thoughts. My pessimistic thoughts consumed me. I felt that no one understood me, and gradually lost contact with friends and family. I started to dread attending events, which usually gave me comfort. Things that I loved doing before, such as teaching, I no longer liked or had the will to do it. I started questioning my purpose in life, what was the point of it all? Soon after, I started contemplating suicide.I almost lost everything to depression. I often walked by overpasses and thought about how easy it would be to end it. I would hear about suicides on the radio, and thought to myself that I had to keep quiet about my feelings. I attempted suicide two times.My attempts to end my life were not successful. And after the second attempt I found the strength and courage to seek help. I found solace speaking about my feelings to someone who understood.I was comfortable talking with my counsellor and felt that I could trust her. She was there to make me feel better and get me better.I had a particularly bad day at work one day and called her, she told me to come in first thing in the morning. I honestly think she saved my life that day.- David","Lives change here.

FIT tracks the progress of our clients at each session through the use of a questionnaire and allows us to adjust treatment as needed based on the results.Why do we make our clients fill out questionnaires at every session and why we dedicate the time to analyze and monitor these questionnaire responses? For the same reason your physician monitors your vital signs. Think of FIT as your emotional vital signs. FIT allows us to see where you are and ensuring your treatment is working or adjusting it if need be. In fact imagine if your doctor was providing you with treatment but couldnt see or know if the treatment was working. It sounds crazy, right?

As a coping mechanism, she began using drugs and alcohol. At 40 years of age after years of battling her addiction Dolly met Mark Wetter and fell in love. Dolly recovered from her addiction and their love grew stronger.When Mark and Dolly said they wanted to get married, the Drop-In offered to help. Community connected. Joy was created.The couple was married in a charming ceremony. Dolly wore a beautiful white gown. A flower girl dropped rose petals along the aisle. After the couple was introduced as man and wife, Mrs. Wetter joyfully pumped her fists.Its really overwhelming, an emotional Mark said after the ceremony. What a road to go down, and its not over yet, but this is a huge, huge step.Why get involved? We can feel really helpless about things happening in the world, says Rev.

People cross the street or change seats on transit to avoid being too near to them. No feeling can match that level of loneliness and isolation. And nothing can prepare someone for the dehumanizing sense of visible invisibility it projects onto their world.In order to help the public feel more comfortable co-existing with homeless men and women in their communities, the Calgary Drop-In Centre has partnered with the City of Calgary, the Downtown Community Association and a number of local non-profit organizations to create the Engaging Vulnerable People workshop.This workshop has been especially well received by new recruits with the Calgary Police Service and EMS  many of whom have reported the incredible difference it has made in improving their interactions with homeless populations.50% of Calgary Drop-In clients regularly work; and 58,000 Calgary households are one pay cheque, or crisis, away from homelessness.OTHER SERVICES WE OFFER:24/7 BUILDING ACCESS: Our compassionate and well trained staff work around the clock providing 24/7 Building Access and 24/7 Care to our clients.ARTBEAT STAGE: Through a combination of volunteerism and donations, every Friday night the Calgary Drop-In Centre brings in musical acts both locally and travelling around the continent to provide a musical solace for our community.BUILDING SECURITY: Our team of licensed and well trained security staff work diligently to protect our clients, staff, and property.

"56",686,"Calgary Fetal Alcohol Network: An Alberta Society","Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) is the most common developmental disorder in Canada. It is permanent, complex, most often invisible and is one of the most stigmatised and misunderstood disorders in our society. They are among the most vulnerable, but people with FASD also have many strengths: with the right knowledge and support within their communities, individuals with FASD can lead healthy, fulfilling lives.FASD is a result of brain injury incurred by a fetus as a result of exposure to alcohol in the womb. From childhood through old age, individuals with FASD encounter barriers in everything they undertake in our society, from health care and education, to employment and housing. CFAN started as a grassroots movement over 15 years ago, founded by individuals who realized this complex disorder couldnt be addressed by any one family, organization, service or system. Weve grown into a registered charity that focuses on collaboration and collective impact with the aim to build a network of support and respect that allows children, youth, and adults to thrive in a society that understands their world.We build that network in big ways through program funding and community-building and also in other ways that seem small, but mean so much. Our bursary program, The Empowerment Fund, for example, provides a big boost to individuals with FASD or their families and caregivers throughout the year. Natalie, a young woman with FASD who is a single mom with a toddler, needed to move out of her apartment this summer. Natalie is on AISH, has no vehicle and no friends with trucks who could help her move. She was very afraid shed have to use her grocery money for the month to pay for a moving company to relocate her. However, a friend helped her apply to CFAN for The Empowerment Fund bursary, which paid most of the costs of a moving truck. This was a huge relief for her and helped make sure she and her daughter didnt go hungry.At the same time as we try to ensure individuals with FASD get the supports they need, we also work to help our communities know FASD is preventable. We aim to reduce its incidence through training and education - by getting the message out that no alcohol during pregnancy is best and by supporting women to have healthy, alcohol-free pregnancies.","We believe people with FASD will thrive in a community that is aware and knowledgeable and encourages a healthy response to FASD issues. We are proud to work together with our members, funded agencies and other community systems and service partners to respond to the strengths and challenges of individuals, families, caregivers and communities impacted by FASD across the lifespan.Through the wonderful donors and funders who support our work, we are:Increasing the capacity of community services to help children, youth and adults with FASD succeed in areas such as education, housing, justice and health through our Best Practices in FASD Interventions training. In 2016-17, we trained 863 professionals across 6 sectors to help them better serve individuals who may have FASD that they encounter in their front line work. This training was also offered at MRUs Nursing program, U of Cs Nursing and Homelessness Certificate programs, and Bow Valley Colleges Addictions Studies and Aboriginal Mental Health programs.Supporting frontline services through grant stewardship delivering 15 programs that work with over 1100 individuals and families with FASD each year and help reduce the incidence of FASD. Clients of CFAN-funded agencies are engaged in high-quality programs that help stabilize families and support each person - from child to adult - to reach for their potential in education, physical and mental health, employment, safety, and being full members of their communities.Engaging the Calgary and area community in collective impact initiatives to identify priority issues and opportunities for advocacy, research, prevention, and improving access to services. We have completed a study into best practices for supporting individuals with FASD across the lifespan and are just beginning research into the factors that influence woment to continue to consume alcohol despite knowing they are pregnant. This research will help us understand better how to support alcohol-free pregnancies and prevent FASD.Raising awareness about FASD misperceptions, reducing stigma, and promoting FASD prevention. In 2016-17, we trained 920 professionals in our Prevention Conversation workshops across 7 sectors. Participants learn how to engage women in non-judgmental and supportive conversations on alcohol and pregnancy. The training has also been included as part of MRUs School of Nursing curriculum and inclusion in the Midwifery program is under discussion.","CFAN works through two pillars of practice: service delivery and collective impact.1. Service deliveryNetwork Resource Worker - Individuals, families and caregivers addressing the needs of someone with an FASD often require information, supports and services across many systems, such as health, education, employment or justice. Often, supports and services in these areas have waitlists, or paths to connecting with supports and services are complex and confusing. Sometimes, only short-term assistance is needed, such as help completing a form. Professionals with clients who have FASD may need advice on what kinds of community services there are, or on how best to work with someone with FASD. The Network Resource Worker helps in all these areas through offering information, referrals, system navigation, short-term supports, and advocacy.Best Practices in FASD Interventions Training - Because of the nature of brain injury due to pre-natal alcohol exposure, the typical practices of systems such as education, justice, housing, health and employment often throw up barriers for people with FASD. CFAN has done research into best practices for supporting someone with FASD to succeed. We offer training to professionals who may encounter individuals with FASD in their day-to-day work, tailored to the organizations needs and time frame, helping frontline workers understand how to recognize someone who may be affected by FASD and work with them from a strengths-based, supportive, and respectful perspective.The Prevention Conversation Training - Exposure to alcohol in the womb is the cause of FASD, but there is a lot of mixed messaging in our society about pregnancy and alcohol consumption. There is no proven safe level or timing of consumption, so no alcohol during the entire pregnancy is the best policy. However, often doctors and other professionals are reluctant to speak with women about this topic. The Prevention Conversation training teaches professionals and other supportive audiences how to hold short, motivational conversations with women to help broach the topic in a non-judgmental, non-threatening way. Through the Prevention Conversation, we aim to support women to have healthy pregnancies and healthy babies, reducing the incidence of FASD in our province.Direct FASD Service Funding - CFAN is part of the Government of Albertas Cross-Ministry-Committee (CMC) FASD Initiative. Through the CMC, we steward over $2,000,000 in grants to 15 programs at 9 different agencies which offer direct supports to children, youth, adults and families/caregivers affected by FASD in Calgary and area.2. Collective impactCFANs membership helps determine our direction. Through membership directives, we conveneThe FASD Collective Impact Group, which has 13 partners from a wide variety of systems and services. The shared purpose of the FASD Collective is to improve outcomes and community conditions for individuals and families potentially or directly impacted by FASD.The Caregiver Advisory Committee, which provides opportunities for parents and caregivers of individuals with FASD to assess, inform, and provide input into the priorities and strategies of the Calgary FASD network.The Coordinated Access Standing Committee, which is exploring new ways to address access to service issues, waiting lists, system navigation and referral.The Alcohol and Pregnancy Working Group, which is conducting research on understanding the factors contributing to maternal alcohol consumption after pregnancy recognition.As well, CFAN participates on a wide variety of community tables, such as the Aboriginal Standing Committee on Homelessness and Housing, the Bow Valley College FASD Education Certificate Advisory Committee, The Calgary Domestic Violence Collective, Indigenous Community Table FASD and Justice Working Group, and Mental Health inter-agency meetings.","Donate: CFAN is a small agency with big impact!

"57",637,"Calgary Fiddlers Association","The room is cold and somehow feels empty. Its almost Christmas. Shouldnt there be lights and trees and Rudolph music here? The 4 year old boys head hurts and the words he hears from the big people in the room are jumbled and too big for him to understand. Why does it hurt so much, and why is he feeling confused all the time. To fill the dullness of this place his mind begins to wander to a recurring day-dream that he is playing a little violin just like the lady, a few months before, at the CPOs Saturday Morning at the Symphony. The beautiful music in his mind engulfs him briefly bringing him instant comfort. Josh is suddenly interrupted and fear returns as he looks to see his crying mothers face. He knows something is wrong, but it will be many years before he understands that this moment has changed his life forever.That fateful day, Josh is diagnosed with neurofibramatosis. The petit and grand mal seizures intensify and the intensive care unit becomes his home over the Christmas holidays. Feeling sorry for Josh that he will not be with his brothers and sisters on Christmas morning, his neurologist asks him what one thing he wishes for most. On Christmas morning with his eyes as big as saucers, he excitedly opens the special gift from his doctor. Its a tiny 1/8 size violin!The months and years pass and Josh learns to live with cognitive decline and impairments to his speech, language processing and increasing forgetfulnenss. Without the successes he experiences with the violin, his parents envision a decline in his spirit. Miraculously, his neurological deficits are not affecting his ability to play his violin. In fact, his music ability continues to improve and becomes the driving force and constant in his life. It is the one thing he knows he is improving at and enjoying.At the age of 7, Joshs musical dreams get even bigger when he announces to his parents one day I want to be a Calgary Fiddler. The fiddle performance he attends with his violin teacher stirs an emotion within him of determination and drive. He is dreaming big, but he knows that with practice and hard work he can do it. And do it, he does! At the age of 14 while still experiencing seizures on a daily basis, Josh aces his audition for the Calgary Fiddlers and embarks on a 4-year journey of the most active and fulfilling musical years of his young life.Josh credits music and fiddling, in particular, to his emotional and physical healing. Not only did performing and learning to fiddle (and mandolin) build his self-confidence, his leadership skills developed as he mentored new fiddlers to the group each year. Now, as a recent graduate of the Calgary Fiddlers program, Josh has joined a folk/indy music band and plans to go to college for music production.The Calgary Fiddlers Association fiddle music education programs create amazing young people who gain so much from seeing first-hand how their music affects others, both emotionally and spiritually.","The Calgary Fiddlers Association is a non-profit, charitable organization celebrating its 35th Anniversity during 2017.CFA Mandate: To preserve, promote and perform all types of fiddling, with a particular emphasis on Canadian styles.Why? Fiddling is an old art which emerged in 10th century Europe and has traditionally been passed down from generation to generation. This folk music has played an important and integral part in the cultural fabric of many nations, as well as Canada. For a time (not so long ago), there was an inherent risk the fiddle tradition was dying out. Our aim is to provide as many opportunities as possible for youth to continue the tradition of fiddling, or to be exposed to it, within Calgary and area.CFA Mission: Through the art ofCanadian fiddle music, we motivate, educate, and inspire children to develop musically and socially.Why? The Calgary Fiddlers Association emerged from the classical violin program at Mount Royal Conservatory of Music in 1981. At that time, Dr. Norman Burgess was the Director of the Conservatory and his passion for innovation, creativity and excellence led him to create the Calgary Fiddlers program for young classically trained musicians. He loved classical violin and he LOVED to fiddle (his two worlds collided to create something VERY special). Our very unique programs motivate, educate and inspire classically trained youth to embrace classically-inspired fiddle music while making life-long friends.CFA Vision: To develop life skills in ouryoung students such as leadership, confidence, discipline, and time management, and an appreciation for the Canadian heritage of folk fiddling; all acquired with exposure to local and international performance experiences, while promoting and preserving the art of fiddle music.Why? In addition to providing a rich musical education setting, the Association provides over 100 performance opportunities each year to young students. Performing allows our youth to develop essential skills that help them become amazing citizens within their community. They share toe-tapping fiddle culture and music with all ages in schools, seniors facilities, emergency shelters, conventions, malls and are ambassadors for Calgary, Alberta and Canada wherever they go.HIGHLIGHTS (2015-2016):Despite the downturn during our latter fiscal year performance opportunities remaining steady. The Calgary Fiddlers were invited to perform at more conferences and conventions in Banff and LakeLouise which allowed us to have solid revenue. Additionally, we had a regular contract with TauckTours International for opportunities to perform at Heritage Park for their tourists approximately 20times during the summer months.70 Students enrolled for 2016-2017 (54 Bow Valley Fiddlers* and 16 Calgary Fiddlers)59 Studentsenrolled for2015-2016(44 Bow Valley Fiddlers* and 15 Calgary Fiddlers)400 Attendees at December 2015 Fiddle Fantasia presentation at the University Theatre320 Attendees at March 2016 Barn Dance at the Thorncliffe Greenview Community Hall300 Attendees at May 2016 two-hour show at the Ironwood Stage  Grill* Bow Valley Fiddlers is large as it accepts fiddle students (ages 6-18) who want to learn to fiddle and do some performing throughout the year. Once our students turn 13 there is the option to audition for the Calgary Fiddlers. The Calgary Fiddlers is a HUGE commitment, so if students have other activities and just want to fiddle for fun while skiing, playing hockey, etcthey just continue on in our in our highest level Bow Valley Fiddlers group.COMMUNITY IMPACT:Our educational program offers young classical violin students of varying abilities new opportunitities to learn various styles of fiddling, and are also given opportunities to perform in the Calgary and area communities.Like many Canadians, we were moved by the hardship, heartbreak and chaos affecting the displaced Fort McMurray individuals and families.In May 2016, we hosted a free benefit concert Fiddles for Food to raise money for those affected by this tremendouswildfire.We offer opportunities for over 150 volunteers each year who wish to participate in our events and give back to the community.First of all theyre good, theyre very, very good. And they bring a bit of Calgary magic with them. To me they represent what Calgary is all about. They represent the entrepreneurial spirit, the free enterprise spirit, they represent culture and art. They represent everything that is good about this city.        -Ralph Klein","The Calgary FiddlersSince the formation of The Calgary Fiddlers in 1981, this highly skilled group of amateur musicians, ranging from 14 to 18 years of age, has performed for live audiences, television and radio broadcasts, and concert tours. Over the years, the group has toured extensively throughout such places as Spain, France, Scotland  Ireland, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Florida, Kansas, Iowa, Montana,Wyoming, Minnesota and Hawaii. They were chosen as ambassadors of Alberta for centennial celebrations in Ottawa, where they performed with the National Art Centre Orchestra in May 2005. They have been sent by the Alberta and Canadian Governments as ambassadors to Korea, Los Angeles, Monte Carlo and Monaco, and New York City. The Fiddlers have also had the privilege of performing for dignitaries such as H.S.H. Prince Albert of Monaco,former Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, Prime Minister Stephen Harper, the President of Yemen and His Holiness the fourteenth Dali Lama. Recent notable appearances include the opening of the Live with Kelly show in Banff, AB and a feature spot on the Australia TODAY show, filmed in Lake Louise.The Bow Valley FiddlersThe Bow Valley Fiddlers, created in 1995, is a division of The Calgary Fiddlers Association and although they are separate and distinct from The Calgary Fiddlers division, both groups fall under the same association. Bow Valley Fiddlers (ages 13-18 years of age) aspiring to dedicate more time to fiddling and performing; many audition to be members of the The Calgary Fiddlers. To see these fiddlers at the Calgary International Childrens Festival, click here.Our Programs. How do we do it?Weekly RehearsalsThere are currently a total of 5 fiddle groups that meet weekly to learn fiddle tunes and accompanying choreography. Fiddling in an ensemble setting emphasizes listening skills, timing and teamwork.One-on-one CoachingEach fiddle student meets with fiddle instructors for several one-on-one coaching sessions each semester to learn the bowing techniques and timing unique to the fiddle genre.WorkshopsIntensive fiddle workshop weekends are offered to fiddle students twice per year. Clinicians are brought in to work with our students on dancing, choreography, public speaking, percussion and fiddling. On occasion. there are opportunities for our students to work with fiddle great such as Natalie MacMaster, Gordon Stobbe, Daniel Gervais and Ben Plotnick.Touring OpportunitiesEach year, our fiddlers have opportunities to perform either provincially, nationally and internationally. We feel touring is an integral addition to our programming. It allows our students to perform several full shows in culturally unique communities and countries. This opens their eyes to how others live, and to view the world in a musical context. The people and youth they meet on these tours also helps them to forge life-long relationships.Community Outreach Programs1) Healing Through MusicIn 2016, the Calgary Fiddlers Association implemented a unique outreach program to help meet the emotional needs of the community. These specialized performances are designed to improve mood and mobility, relieve anxiety, stress and depression, and enhance concentration and creativity through live interactive shows. Those living in seniors facilities, hospitals, hospices and temporary living facilities such as Inn From the Cold, and organizations empowering youth with disabilities are the greatest beneficiaries.2) Spread Fiddle MusicIn 2012, as part of our 30th Anniversary year, the Association began the Spread Fiddle Music initiative. The primary goal of this initiative is to share fiddle music (and the love of music, in general) within school settings, and to inspire young students to take up a musical instrument of any kind. We also focus on the many diverse fiddle genres, and provide interactive opportunities for students to play the spoons, shakers, learn some traditional fiddle dances and to hold a violin.","The Calgary Fiddlers Association is always seeking sponsors, donors and in-kind contributions to help stretch our budget.Financial Bursaries: Support a fiddler in need!$550-$2000 can help one of students pay for a whole year of fiddle programming (group rehearsals, one-on-one coaching, 2 fiddle camps, costumes and photo keepsake).Each year, we have students whose families are unable to meet the financial commitment of being in our program due to job loss, illness, work-related accidents and family separation/divorce.

Wyatt has been in a wheelchair since he was injured in an accident as a child. He works downtown, and cannot take regular city transit due to the heavy rush hour crowds and having no bus stop near his house. Every day Wyatt takes a HandiBus to and from work. He credits HandiBus with allowing him to have the job he wants and not be limited by his disability. Jason has faced many challenges in his short life. He is confined to a wheelchair, has cognitive disabilities, is blind and non-verbal. Jason has a full time care giver to help him navigate his days.

"59",442,"Calgary Health Trust","Every day we see the incredible impact our donors have on the lives of people in our community. We hear stories from many areas of health care in ways that someones life has been touched. These stories are just a few examples of why we are excited to work with our donors to make a difference.Providing the highest quality of care: During early complications in her preganancy with twins, Salima learned she was already 5 cm dialated. Instantly she was put on bed rest and at just 27 weeks she went into labour. The team from the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) were on hand to assist with the delivery of her tiny and fragile babies. Being so early, they had a lot of growing to do and were kept in incubators with machines to help them breathe until their lungs were big enough to take their first breaths on their own. Donors to the NICU make it possible to ensure that the specialized equipment required by the smallest and most fragile patients is the absolute best.When the twins were stable enough, they were able to share an incubator and their bond helped them grow; a bond that was captured by a nurse as the tiny twins held each others hands in their sleep. Today, the twins are four and live a healthy and active life, but the one thing that hasnt changed is the special bond they share.Inyana and Ilaan bring so much joy to my life, says Salima, I cant imagine what would have happened to them if it werent for the amazing health care we have here in Calgary.Bringing life-saving innovation to Calgary: On a conference call, a heart attack was the last thing that Don thought would ever happen to him. Instantly he was rushed to the hospital where doctors prepped him for what would be an extremely complex and risky surgery. As he was prepped for surgery, the only thing that mattered to Don was his family. Thanks to the generosity of donors, Foothills Medical Centre is now equipped with a state-of-the-art Cardiac Hybrid Operating Room that allows surgeons to undertake the most complex conditions using the best technology and least invasive proceedures. Today, Don celebrates every moment he has with his family - the family he was so close to losing.My wife almost lost her husband and my kids almost lost their father. This is my opportunity to say thanks to all the staff, nurses and doctors who have really given me my life [back], because my life was over and I like to say now I am playing the bonus round. But, because of the life Ive been given Im able to help other people moving forward. So, thank you!Preventing complications and providing high quality of life: Every day, Dr. Heidi Rabi sees patients that cannot afford basic dental care. Oral health is often the window to overall health, and when people dont have the money for proper oral care, they can face serious health complications down the road. Funding for the dental program goes a long way in not only addressing dental concerns before they spread to serious infections and complications, but also gives patients that little bit of self-confidence they need to go out and face the world.For a patient, fixing the way that they look when they open their mouth, or smile, is a complete life changer, because you take them from somebody who is possibly ashamed of being in public and you transform their life. The amount of confidence they gain from being able to open their mouths, from being able to smile, is a complete game changer.These are just a few examples of how donations touch the lives of the people in our community.Thats where Calgary Health Trust comes in  we see the big picture and work with the community to make philanthropic investments in areas of health that will have the biggest impact. Its for our family, our friends and our neighbours. One day, it may even be for ourselves.","Health care touches us all! Our donors know that health care is a vital part of our community and the foundation for a great life. It is something that will impact our family, friend, neighbours and one day, even ourselves. Calgary Health Trust raises funds for health and wellness initiatives to ensure that everyone  young and old  is able to experience the highest quality of life!Where ever your interest in health care is, we can help you make a difference.Calgary Health Trust has been raising funds for state-of-the-art technology, innovative programs, research and education in health care for nearly 20 years. We work closely with our partners at Alberta Health Services to identify the areas where philanthropy will have the greatest impact on health care within Calgary today and over the long term. Together with the generosity of our donors, sponsors and volunteers, we invest in areas of prevention, early detection, treatment, rehabilitation and recovery at Foothills Medical Centre, Peter Lougheed Centre, Rockyview General Hospital, South Health Campus, and within Womens Health, Carewest continuing care centres, community prevention and harm-reduction programs, and other health care organizations that impact those in our community.To see how donor investments are making an incredible impact for people in our community, read our Annual Report.Since 1996, weve raised more than $392 million for health care in Calgary. Recently, these funds have made a new state-of-the-art Interventional Trauma Operating Room and Cardiac Hybrid Operating Room a reality at Foothills Medical Centre and assisted in funding the Vascular Surgery Redevelopment Project at Peter Lougheed Centre that will assist thousands of people suffering from vascular conditions across Southern Alberta. We were also amoung the 2015 recipients of the Calgary Herald Christmas Fund in support of the Calgary Sexual Assault Response team at Sheldon M. Chumier Health Centre. The $99,198 recieved from this program has ensured the team can provide the best care to those who have been sexually assulted wherever they live.With every investment in health care our donors make, Calgary Health Trust strives to ensure Calgary is home to the best care for those who need it.","We see the big picture on health care and work with our donors and partners at Alberta Health Services to ensure that philanthropy will have the biggest impact for the health of people in our community.Our fundraising efforts focus on three priorities:Developing world-class care;Impacting Albertans and their families;Improving quality of life for those living in our city.Health care touches all of us and we are proud to make a difference to the people we care about in many important ways:Those who need to get better; hospitals and acute care centresThose who need to stay well; prevention and harm reduction programsThose living with chronic pain; clinic and outpatient careThose at the end of their lives; palliative careThose at the beginning of their lives; labour  delivery and neonatal careWe believe that good health and quality of life is the foundation for a great life and vibrant community. We believe that health care is the foundation for making Calgary the best place to live, work and raise a family for many generations to come.","Health care is so important to how we live our lives and the quality in which we live them. Our role is to help inspire the community to take action in ensuring that we have the best health care right in our own back yard. Donations are critical in driving innovation forward and taking health care from good to great. There are many ways that we work with people in the community to help them make an impact that will last for generations to come.Through our mixed fundraising approach, donors have lots of options in how they make a difference to health care. Donors can choose to make a difference in many ways, such as the following:Donate: Every day donors make contributions to hospitals and programs because they have been greatly impacted by the care theyve received or they believe that investments in health care are so important to our city. We couldnt agree more! You can donate online at calgaryhealthtrust.ca, by phone at 403-943-0615 or by visiting our office at any of our hospitals.Leave a Legacy: A Planned Gift is a thoughtful way to make a lasting impact on an organization. Planned gifts are easy to arrange and with the help of your advisors can help you develop a plan that provides for your loved ones, maximizes tax and financial benefits and makes a difference to everyone in the community.Create an Endowment: An endowment fund is a gift that keeps giving. A modest donation of $5,000 can plant the seed for the growth of a significant endowment down the road.Give a Gift of Shares: Donating publicly traded shares, bonds or mutual funds is becoming increasingly popular because ofsignificant tax saving incentives. A gift of securities to Calgary Health Trust can completely eliminate the steep capital gains tax you would incur if you were to sell these assets and donate the proceeds.Create a Community Initiative: Our Community Partners are instrumental to raising money for areas that are important to them. They do everything from golf-tournaments to art sales to hosting runs. Their work helps get the word out about how health care is making a difference in the lives of many people in our community.Sponsor or Support an Event: Events are an important part of the work that we do. Sponsors and ticket purchasers help to ensure that we can maximize the proceeds raised for the cause while ensuring that everyone has a great time.Buy a Hospital Home Lottery ticket: Our lotteries are important to raising significant funds for our hospitals.

"60",383,"Calgary Homeless Foundation (CHF)","Since 2008, when Calgarys Plan to End Homelessness was launched, the Calgary Homeless Foundation (CHF) and its partner agencies in the homeless-serving sector have worked together to bring Calgarians home. Since the launch of the plan, almost 7,000 people have been housed with essential supports to help them thrive in our communities.This past November, 29 families experiencing homelessness in Calgary would have gone another Christmas without a home if it werent for CHF and six partner service agencies working with the Calgary Residential Rental Association (CRRA) and several Calgary landlords. Instead, these families moved into a home of their home through a campaign called Hope for the Holidays, Celebrate the Season at Homes. This campaign has been specifically designed to permanently house families chronically living on Calgarys streets or in shelters.Home provides kids with that sense of security, that sense of belonging, shares Dustin, a client recently housed through Calgarys Plan to End Homelessness with his two young children.Nowwe walk down the street and we come up to our building and we can actually say:Oh, were home. The home is everything to a child, right, just like its everything to you. Home is like, the foundation of your family.This is just one example of how our community, our homeless-serving agencies and CHF are making a big impact in our fight to end homelessness in Calgary.There is still much work to be done. We know that close to 16,000 Calgarians are at risk of homelessness. We know we need to house an additional 3,200 people to ensure those experiencing chronic and episodic homelessness do not remain trapped with no way home. And, we know, we cannot do it alone.","The Calgary Homeless Foundation (CHF) isthesystem planner for Calgarys homeless-serving system of care. It acts as the backbone organization that oversees implementation of Calgarys Plan to End Homelessnessalong with agencies, businesses, governments, the faith community, donors and all Calgarians.

CHF was appointed as the lead implementer of The Plan to provided concrete directions to address the following:Historical bi-annual 30% growth rate in homelessness between 1992 and 2008Anticipated 10,000 Calgarians expected to be homeless by 2015Cumulative economic costs of emergency shelter management systems estimated at more than $9 billion over 10 years.Calgarys Plan to End Homelessness has resulted in:Almost 7,000 people being provided permanent housing with supports since 2008A 15% decrease in homelessness in Calgary per 100,000 population since January 2008Positive outcomes for vulnerable AlbertansSocial and economic cost savings to city and province. (An analysis of one-year of housing for 72 individuals with complex needs showed annual cost savings of approximately $2.5 million)","The Calgary Homeless Foundation is a catalyst and enabler for Systems and Service Agencies to optimize client success. CHF focuses on four strategic pillars of work; Research and Development, Community Mobilization, Funder of Outcomes andImpact, and Advance Public and Political Will.In 2016, our goals as the backbone organization for Calgarys homeless-serving sector are to:Scale up the System of Care to meet the needs and priorities of Calgarys Homeless Serving Sector. This is essential to create a more streamlined and integrated System of Care to better assess individual and family needs and to provide multiple access points for housing and supports.Implement plans to address gaps in the System of Care. The benefit being the creation of a more integrated and harmonized system of care that is inclusive of systems and agencies working within and outside the homeless-serving sector.Identity and obtain funding from a broader range of sources within and outside of Government. The impact is greater community engagement in the responsibility of ending homelessness through financial supports toward desired outcomes.Strengthen and enhance organizational support for the homeless-serving sector. It is essential to support all of the agencies and deepen all of our relationships within the sector.Influence community strategy to achieve the housing priority directions of Calgarys Plan to End Homelessness. This will allow for an integrated housing strategy that embeds the needs of the homeless-serving sector within the broader building/rental market community.Improve quality of Homeless Management Information System (HMIS) data and increase scope of Shelter data analysis.

"61",681,"Calgary Horticultural Society","Carol came to Calgary, as many people do, because of work. Once settled, she started looking for things to do and ways to connect with other people.One day, Carol spotted a community garden from the bus on her way home. That fleeting glimpse of a well-tended veggie patch flooded her with longing and fond memories of her Grandmas garden back home. As a child, she often visited and helped out by sampling fresh peas in the pod, sweet raspberries and countless other home-grown treats.Although she was living in a small condo with no yard of her own, Carol felt inspired and determined to try her own hand at gardening, satisfying that nostalgic urge to taste truly fresh-picked produce again. She searched for community gardens in Calgary online and found the Calgary Horticultural Societys website, which informed her that there was indeed a community garden not too far from her condo. She also found that the Society offered a wealth of tips and information on growing vegetables, flowers and trees in Calgarys unique climate.Carol eagerly joined the Society and signed on for a number of workshops, learning which vegetables and plants grow best in Calgary, how to start plants from seed, how to improve the soil, water wisely and when to harvest.At her local community garden Carol met people of all ages from within her own neighbourhood who shared her love of gardening and spending time in the outdoors. From her first season in the garden, Carol was amazed at her success and the number of friends and acquaintances she made. She was very proud to be able to serve some of her own vegetables to dinner guests.During her second season at the garden she was asked to help co-ordinate the groups efforts to improve their heavy clay soil. Back she went to the Horticultural Society to educate herself on best practices for composting and soil amendment. With the help of other volunteers, Carol created a successful composting program that is still in place today. She joined in on the Societys monthly Kitchen Table Talks for community garden leaders, shared her knowledge and ideas and picked up additional gardening and community building tips.By attending education sessions, plant and garlic exchanges and events, reading the newsletter and using her members discount, Carol realized that there are many dimensions to this enjoyable, rewarding and affordable activity in her newly adopted city.Years later, when she married and purchased a house with her new partner, Carol moved her gardening base from the community garden to her very own back yard. She enjoys encouraging her small children to help out and hopes to instil a love of gardening in them as well. She maintains her connection with her many gardening buddies and is still an active member in the Calgary Horticultural Society. She especially enjoys and appreciates the Societys plant sharing events, and Open Garden program, which allows her to visit other members gardens, picking up lots of tips and fresh ideas along the way.While Carols story is unique to her, countless other individuals have learned a great deal about gardening and have formed lasting friendships through the Calgary Horticultural Society. Although our climate can be a challenge, we can all beautify our own yards, balconies and public spaces with an almost endless variety of gorgeous plants and trees. The Society has just under 5,000 members and we always have room for moreso please consider joining us, learning from us, sharing with us and volunteering as time permits.Carols name has been changed to protect her privacy.","Vision: Gardening for Life!Mission: To encourage gardening for the enhancement of our environment and quality of life.Values:Put the fun into gardening;Connect and support new and experienced gardeners;Promote learning and successful gardening;Work with the environment to minimize our footprint;Lead in making Calgary a city of gardening excellence.The Societys mandate has a strong focus on gardening education and offers Calgarians the knowledge and skills to do it well.

The Calgary Horticultural Society helps new and experienced gardeners learn ways to be successful by providing fun and educational programming all year round. Our programs are designed to help Calgarians enjoy a healthy, beautiful yard without compromising the environment. Volunteers play a major role in who we are, what we do and how we work.Our Programs:1) Garden Show - Objectives include celebrating, educating and promoting gardening in Calgary and the Society and raising funds. A two-day event present each spring includes an education program of speakers and demonstrations, an information and garden trade show element, and a place for gardening organizations and groups to exhibit their programs and wares at a subsidized rate.2) Workshops and Talks - Aim to engage, inspire and educate. A wide range of topics are presented throughout the year. Trees were a major focus this year following the 2014 fall snow storm that devastated up to 10% of the citys canopy. Workshops are open to the public and have a fee attached for attending and to cover costs and instructors honorariums.3) Demonstration and Teaching Garden at the Society Office - The back and front yards located at the Societys office have been transformed from a tradition al lawn into an outdoor classroom. The area includes variety of beds, spaces with yard smart modifications such as a rain garden, redirected downspouts for use with rain barrels and three large-size demonstration compost bins, and a wide range of plants and vegetables. Volunteers manage and tend the garden and classes held here enable participants to get their hands dirty.4) The Community Gardens Resource Network (CGRN), now in its 8th year, is designed to strengthen and promote this movement through education, the creation of a network of resources, expertise and collaborative connections to provide start-up assistance for new gardens and ongoing support for established ones. Gail Blackhall is the Coordinator of the program and to many a mentor. The program includes an informative website and a searchable database to locate gardens; education workshops and sessions such as Kitchen Table Talks for garden leaders to share information and ideas and a twice monthly e-newsletter full of community information and events. The CGRN works closely with The City of Calgary Parks, and gathers its strength and success from its association with the many other organizations in the city and province that form the network.Beauty on a Budget Program  Yard Smart Education Series. The purpose is to engage, educate and empower Calgarians to reduce outdoor water consumption and manage storm water quality and quantity on their properties, while learning to successfully garden.Working with City of Calgary, Water Resources, the program has three parts that include:Beauty on a Budget  for beginners.

The Garlic Exchange, traditionally a community gardens event, celebrates and promotes growing heritage garlic hardy to the Calgary climate and growing conditions and to maintain the cultivation of varieties of heritage garlic for future gardening generations. Over the last few years, The Society has been working with Fort Calgary, shared garden at Inglewood and McClure community gardens, Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT) Culinary Arts chefs, growing heritage garlic to share and exchange. Last year, 81 people participated in exchange: 64 individual and 17 community gardens and 38 garlic varieties (257 garlic bulbs).

"62",530,"Calgary Humane Society","We exist for cats like Krikit.Krikit was helpless when a Good Samaritan found him abandoned on a rural road. Weighing barely a pound and no more than three weeks old, Krikit was in trouble. Young kittens rely on their mothers for everything, but Krikits mother was nowhere to be found. Knowing that Krikits future was uncertain, the Good Samaritan decided to give him the best possible chance and brought him to Calgary Humane Society.On arrival, Krikit was rushed back to the CHS veterinary staff for examination where it was discovered that an eye infection had sealed his right eye shut. Krikit was gently bathed with warm water to remove the dirt and grime that coated his fur and face and treated with antibiotics to help his eye heal. Then came the next challenge  Krikit had to eat.Krikit was still too young to eat solid foods, and with no mother to provide him with milk, his future would be uncertain. One of our animal health technologists coaxed Krikit to accept a bottle of Mammalac, a kitten milk replacement. Learning that Krikit would accept the replacement milk was a relief  he could survive and thrive as long as he was eating  but due to his size and level of development he would need to be fed every two or three hours around the clock.Foster families do life-saving work at Calgary Humane Society. Within hours of Krikits admission, a wonderful foster parent answered our emergency call for help, agreeing to take on the daunting task of 24 hour cat mom. Under the watchful eyes of his foster parent and CHS veterinary staff, Krikit transformed from a tiny helpless kitten to a bouncing ball of feline energy. The weeks flew by as Krikit grew stronger and discovered the joy of normal kitten mischief. During his time with Calgary Humane Society Krikit won over the hearts of his foster family and every staff member who met him. After almost two months of care Krikit was ready to find a new home and within four hours of being moved to the adoptions floor Krikit had won over another set of hearts  the hearts of his new forever family.","Our mission is simple:To Help as Many Animals As We Can.Our goal?

With its humble beginnings in 1988, C.I.E.S. has grown to include over 150 dedicated staff and over 100 volunteers who provide anone-stop-shop for new immigrants and economically challenged individuals. With its mission to help provide free and lost-cost alternatives to expensive settlement programming, C.I.E.S. strives to:Provide English as a Second Language classes to newcomers.Assist newcomers and low income Canadians inbecoming more self-sufficient through employment.Give fair access to newcomers to existing services and organizations by helping themovercome the various barriers encountered in the settlement process.Promote a mutual understanding and respect between the mainstream and ethnic communities on cultural issues.Deliver programming for the people who need it, not only those who can afford it.With 29 years of experience and a blended staff of newcomers and immigrants, C.I.E.S. is proud to provide a personal, compassionate environment that feels like home. For a greater idea of how we serve the community, here is what one of our graduates had to say:A friend informed me of the Calgary Immigrant Educational Society which led me to do some research on the courses they offer; this influenced my decision to pursue the Basic Computer Skills course. Our instructor Mr. Mayuanan Selvaratnam delivered the instructional material efficiently and effectively, therefore, the content was easily understood. My other classmates can attest to the fact that we were all motivated to learn. He had our interest at heart and was able to facilitate our individual learning challenges. Pursuing this course has made a tremendous impact on my computer knowledge and skills. I am now familiar with the different components of the computer, software, and applications. I can confidently say I can formulate a proper document for execution and manipulate the computer more readily.I am currently encouraging friends, co-workers and family members to pursue this course and other courses offered by this Institution. - Elizabeth D.B.","The Calgary Immigrant Educational Society (C.I.E.S.) provides various levels of English education, employment training, job bank information, and referral guidance to newcomers and economically disadvantaged Calgarians in an effort to help them find their rightful place in Canadian society.ANNUAL HIGHLIGHTS (2015-16):Open 7 days a week, we serve more than 1200 adult clients and 135 children a day at twolocations; and we also opened 21 additional LINC classes, making it 56 LINC classes in total and 135 childcare seats;We established a cutting edge Communications Department, and introduced The Refugee Express Drop-In ESL  Integration (REDI) Program;We found that 2015-2016 brought CIES a steadygrowth of programs and with it a large increase in the number of staff.WE MAKE SURE YOU KNOW THE LANGUAGEOur variety of robust English education programs help students from over 75 different countries everyday.

The drop-in students amaze me with how hard they work at their English and at adjusting to life in Canada. I continue to be surprised and delighted at the enthusiasm they have for learning and their willingness to support and help each other. In every class, I see stronger students take it upon themselves to help weaker students. And Im always happy to watch friendships develop between the students  in English. I appreciate the students efforts, and am always made to feel appreciated by them. I, like the students, am treated with respect and consideration by CIES staff, and feel fortunate to be a part of this excellent program. - Susan Link (Pre-Basic English Instructor)","www.immigrant-education.ca","colyndegraaff@immigrant-education.ca","130143373RR0001","403.291.0002","Colyn deGraaff","3650321","literaci employ immigr women",63,0.0312989045383412,0.0312989045383412,0.00782472613458529,0.0359937402190923,0.0101721439749609,0.0195618153364632,0.479655712050078,0.0571205007824726,0.0430359937402191,0.104068857589984,0.0219092331768388,0.0641627543035994,0.0359937402190923,0.0312989045383412,0.02660406885759
"64",384,"Calgary Immigrant Women's Association","Olua (not her real name) moved to Canada in 2011 with her husband and three young sons from Nigeria. In her home country, Olua had a successful career as a school administrator, but in Canada due to her qualifications not being recognized, she decided to become a Licensed Practical Nurse. She was trying her best to juggle her responsibilities in raising three young boys and a full time class load. Shortly after starting her studies, Olua was required to be at her school thirty minutes earlier one day for a class photo which meant she would not be home to send her eldest son Michael (seven years old) off to the school bus. Olua made a decision that her son was responsible enough to catch the bus by himself and left him with instructions. However, her son missed the bus as he was watching cartoons and decided to stay home. When the school called Oluas house to inquire about Michaels absence, Michael answered the phone and shared that he was at home alone. The school staff called the police and had them pick Michael up and drive him to school and also reported this to Child and Family Services.Olua was referred to Cross-Cultural Parenting Program at CIWA by a case worker from Child and Family Services. Due to Oluas busy school schedule, the CCPP facilitator met with her one-on-one after her she finished her classes for the day. The Program Facilitator worked around Oluas schedule and went over the entire course curriculum with her within four sessions. Olua learned about child abuse laws, the Canadian school system, positive discipline, institutional pressures, parenting styles, and healthy child development.After several weeks of participation in the Cross-Cultural Parenting Program, Olua felt she had a much better understanding of how to be a successful parent in Canada. She felt more confident to advocate for herself with her sons school and Child and Family Services. Her file with Child and Family Services was closed, which brought her huge relief and allowed Olua to refocus on her family and her studies.CIWA exists for women like Olua. CIWA is a culturally diverse settlement agency that recognizes, responds to, and focuses on the unique concerns and needs of immigrant and refugee women, girls and their families. CIWAs uniqueness is based on having a narrow gender related mandate, which has provided best practices in developing customized female focused initiatives. These initiatives always include children and their well-being as important outcomes of our engagement.CIWA is empowering immigrant women and their families to integrate in the community.","CIWA takes a holistic and wraparound approach to addressing integration challenges immigrant women and their families face when settling in a new country. CIWAs mandate is as follows:VISION:Empower Immigrant Women. Enrich Canadian society.MISSION:To engage and integrate immigrant women and their families in the community.VALUES:Integrity. Equity. Empowerment. Relevance. Collaboration.During its 30 year history, CIWA has developed innovative programs, entered into partnerships and become an organization that is truly responsive to the unique and diverse needs of its constituency. Over the years, CIWA has made the transition to Canada a more comfortable, pleasant and successful one for more than 80,000 immigrant women.CIWA focuses its financial strategy on strengthening core programs in the areas of settlement, language training, employment skills, and family services. We also respond to tenders for new pilot initiatives by developing innovative program ideas to compete with other agencies for government funding. We feel confident that our funders value the good work that we do for clients and our adherence to standards of professional accountability.A key component to CIWAs financial growth and sustainability involves the enhancement of fund development strategies through research, consultations, networking and development of strong partnerships. We will continue to work towards expanding funding for enhanced language training projects, skills training, and other projects aimed at supporting clients with basic needs and/or family violence issues. We hope that our effort to connect with the corporate sector will provide further stability for the organization through small projects that will benefit our clients and the entire Calgary community.Over the years, CIWA has been locally and nationally recognized for our commitment to serving immigrant women and their families through collaborative and innovative approaches to service delivery.

Almost 30% of CIWA clients have 12 years of education or less. These women face issues related to self-esteem, health and poverty, attitude towards education, learning disabilities, family violence, and an inability to support their children in school. It is important for CIWA to support this highly barriered and isolated client group. CIWA values inclusion and strives to support all immigrant women in their integration process. Due to the lack of formal education, these women are missing foundational learning skills and are not equipped to function fully in a text driven society. By donating to CIWA, you will be supporting the integration of these multi-barriered clients into our community.Calgary is a diverse city and we invite you to set an example of inclusion and tolerance by contributing a small amount to our services that will support newcomers in their ability to co-exist with you and your family and contribute to our community.","http://www.ciwa-online.com/","director@ciwa-online.com","118823657RR0001","403.444.1755","Beba Svigir","9793631","literaci employ immigr women",64,0.0160116448326055,0.0160116448326055,0.00946142649199418,0.0160116448326055,0.0225618631732169,0.0443959243085881,0.454876273653566,0.0225618631732169,0.0181950509461427,0.0771470160116448,0.0291120815138282,0.127365356622999,0.0116448326055313,0.0312954876273654,0.10334788937409

Our organization is made up of people who work, live and care about the communities where we operate. We provide resources to individuals who are at risk of offending and empower them to make positive choices and changes in their lives. This page highlights the work being done to educate communities, encourage restorative responses to crime and help men, women and youth find hope, learn skills and reintegrate into our communities.The following is a staff story about a former resident of Bedford House, CJHS Community Residential Facility  commonly referred to as a Halfway House.I was in traffic at a red light when I heard a horn honking. I ignored it until I heard someone calling my name three cars away. I looked out the window and a former resident, who left Bedford House about four months prior, was waving at me. I leaned out the window to say Hi! He had an ear-to-ear grin and was excited when he spoke: Hey! I just bought this van and I have a full-time job! I just wanted to say thanks to you guys for helping me! I smiled and congratulated him on his new job and told him: It wasnt us that made you succeed, it was all you. We were here to support you, and you put in the work you needed to succeed so good on ya! He smiled and asked this writer to pass on his thanks to the rest of the staff. The light turned green and in my rear view mirror I still remember the smile and look of pride on his face as we waved good bye.","Calgary John Howard Society has a vision ofan informed community, active in preventing crime. Through its mission of promoting positive change through humane, just and informed responses to crime and its effects, the CJHS works every day to help individuals change their lives for the better by making positive life choices. The people most impacted by the work of this organization are the youth who are given a means to turn their lives around, and the adults who come to live at one of CJHS housing facilities. Calgary John Howard Society helps these adults learn what it is like to live in a community again, as they figure out what their lives will look like after they are released from prison.And while the work of CJHS is based on the unique and very personal wins of the individual, it is the community that really wins, as we build a community where it is safe for us all to live, where there is understanding and humane responses to crime, and where every person is treated with dignity, equity, fairness and compassion.To see how CJHS impacts the lives of people every day, please take a look at the attached video showing the work of the organization. Also, our recent annual reports showcase the many individuals who have benefited from our programming that include:Community housing with support services for homeless youth and adults;Transitional housing for men and women re-entering the community from Federal corrections institutes;Job skills and employment readiness training;Support for individuals with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder;Adult learning and literacy;Prison services where we connect with individuals in prison to help them plan for life after their release;Support for families who have a family member in prison;Life management and social skills support;Empowerment and advocacy for individual growth; andYouth services that educate youth about the criminal justice system and provide support for youth who are at risk of, or who have become involved with the Youth Criminal Justice System.","While all of our programs can always benefit from increased financial support, the three programs that would benefit the most from enhanced funding at this particular time are:1. Extended Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) Support ProjectAt CJHS, we advocate for individuals with FASD to gain independence. We help them build the tools to make better decisions, connect them with others who are going through similar issues, and help them find information about their condition.The Extended FASD Support Project helps adults who have been assessed with or who are suspected of having FASD and who are at risk of, or who are already involved in the criminal justice system. The program implements a comprehensive care approach that considers the goals of the client, the resources available to them in the community, and the process of an FASD assessment to ensure each individual in the program has the best quality of life possible. For more information about our Extended FASD Support Project, visit our website at http://www.calgaryjohnhoward.org/Adult/EFSP.htmlAnticipated outcomes:Client experiences an improved quality of lifeClient does not experience conflict with the law and avoids incarcerationClient understands their strengthsClient has fewer incidents and crisesClient experiences decreased anxiety and improved functioning in the communityStaff are able to identify how they can help individual clients and provide support to those clientsStaff connects clients with additional community supports and resources to extend the services offered by staffCommunity members have an increased awareness of the barriers that individuals living with FASD face in the communityCommunity members have an increased understanding of how to support individuals living with FASDSignificant issues presented by individuals living with FASD are reduced2. Learning Enhancement Employment Program ( LEEP)The LEEP program is a very successful program at CJHS and helps develop job skills and supports the personal growth of adults. For example, it helps our students write resumes, learn about what courses they need to take to get an industry certificate and helps them with things like anger management.The LEEP program provides a comprehensive approach for individuals to gain employability skills, acquire industry tickets and develop self-management and conflict resolution abilities.

"68",309,"Calgary Keys to Recovery Society","My name is Clara and I am an aboriginal woman. I suffered years of abuse in my childhood. Both of my parents were alcoholics and would leave me and my siblings for days at a time. Starting when I was about 8 years old, when my parents took off, I had to look after my sisters who were 5 and 6 years younger than me. When my parents were home, they were physically and verbally abusive. I was molested many times by relatives and friends of my parents. At 14 years old, I left home and moved in with a 23 year old man that I met at a dance. He was just like my parents, although there were times that I thought he loved me. During the 8 years with him, I had 3 children, 2 girls and a boy. They were my world and I vowed not to be like my parents. But, like others who have addiction and mental health issues, I started to use alcohol to cope. My worst fear had come trueI became my parents.When I was 22, my sister took my children with the promise that once I got my life together, I could have them back. I was devastated and I started to use any drug I could find. I left my boyfriend and moved to Calgary where I knew no one. For the next 10 years I lived on the streets of Calgary. Sometimes I slept at a homeless shelter. Mostly I slept outside because I didnt trust the other people who stayed there. My days consisted of lots of walking, trying to find money for booze or drugs. I had to carry everything I owned in my back pack because it would be stolen if I didnt. I tried to sober up so many times, but every time I got clean, bad memories came back and I just couldnt cope with them. My sister went to court and I lost custody of my children. The pain was unbearable.When I was homeless, I was physically and sexually assaulted by other street people and men who preyed on people like me. The street doctor I saw diagnosed me with post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. He said I probably had this all my life because of my childhood and the life I was living on the street surely didnt help. After suffering yet another assault and waking up in the hospital, I made the decision to try treatment again. I was accepted into an addiction treatment centre and for the first time in many years, I felt a little bit of hope for my future.I worked hard, faithfully took my medication for my mental health and I was feeling so much better. Two months later, I was nearly finished treatment and I was petrified. I would be going back to the violence, surrounded by others drug and alcohol abuse, and the desperation to survive each day living on the streets. Luckily for me, this time I was introduced to Keys.Keys to Recovery is an agency like no other. They gave me an apartment with rent that I can afford and they gave me furniture to put in it. They come and visit me in my apartment to help me with things like my mental health, addictions counseling and teach me ways to stay clean and sober. They dont judge me and I trust them. I have relapsed a few times and I was evicted from 4 apartments. They didnt give up on me. During my last relapse, I was full of shame and I was afraid they would kick me out so I avoided the case managers and I refused to open my door when they came to visit. They spoke to me through the door for over an hour and a half telling me that they would not give up on me. I finally opened my door, went to my last treatment centre, and I am now 24 months sober. My children are now 19, 17 and 14 and they are doing good. They still live with my sister in another city but I see them as often as I can and we talk on the phone and Facebook every day. I am a work in progress and I am healing from all the trauma I have been through. Life today is good. If Keys has given up on me, I would have gone back to the streets and I know I would have died.","As part of Calgarys 10 Year Plan to End Homelessness, Calgary Keys to Recovery Society was developed to stop homeless individuals from returning to the streets once they have completed addictions treatment. This is an integral part of Calgarys sytstem of care.Vision Statement: To permanently end homelessness with dignity, compassion, and support for adults recovering from addictions.Mission Statement: Keys to Recovery provides intensive, collaborative case management services, in conjunction with permanent, affordable housing, for highly vulnerable adults who have completed addictions treatment.By not only providing housing but the support they needed to maintain their sobriety and their housing, last year we PERMANENTLY ended homelessness for 100 men and women. Unlike traditional addictions services, we do not discharge a client if they relapse. Keys to Recovery understands that relapse can be a part of the recovery process but that it doesnt mean that the person needs to become homeless once again. We continue to support the person, in whatever way they need, in order to get them back on track. This may look different for each individual. For one person it could mean a return to residential treatment. For another, it could mean an outpatient day program. Some may require increased home visits until they stablize once again while others need to be relocated to a different apartment. Our Case Management team will work alonside each client to determine what type of supports are needed.","Calgary Keys to Recovery Society (Keys to Recovery) conducts an assessment with each referred individual to ensure that they are highly vulnerable (chronically homeless), low income, mental health and/or chronic physical condition and that they require intensive case management support in order to maintain their housing and their sobriety. We offer scattered-site (a few apartments in various buildings throughout Calgary) and place-based (Keys to Recovery holds a Master Lease for the entire building) single or double occupancy housing options.Once the individual is accepted, they choose their apartment from available units and a move in date is determined. Basic furnishings (donated) will be provided as well as groceries to get them started. Calgary Keys to Recovery Society will hold the lease on all apartments and will pay the market rental amount directly to the property manager for each apartment. The client will reimburse Calgary Keys to Recovery Society an amount each month based on 30% of their monthly income plus utilities. Clients are visited by case managers in their homes on a regular basis, depending upon clients level of need but ranges from daily to weekly. Upon acceptance and at three month intervals thereafter, case managers will conduct various evidenced based assessments in the following areas: current needs, vocational, physical, mental health, leisure, financial, housing, addictions, and cultural. Based upon these assessments, the case manager will work with the client to develop a service plan, which is also reviewed every three months, and is entirely determined by the client.Keys to Recovery offers several services in various areas such as addictions counseling/relapse prevention, traditional Aboriginal ceremonies, job or volunteer readiness, psychiatric support, and systems navigation. We also offer 24/7 crisis support.Keys to Recovery is PERMANENT supportive housing. Due to the high acuity of our clients and their complex needs, there is no maximum length of stay. However, we do have three phases that clients can move through. The first phase is the Stabilization Phase. Here, clients are seen by our psychiatrist and psychiatric nurse who provides a full psychiatric assessment. A mental health plan is developed alongside the client. This phase is from 0-12 months.The Preparation Phase is the 2nd phase and is from 1-5 years. In this phase, the clients get their high school diploma, access post-secondary education or re-enter the workforce. The clients are preparing for graduation and independence. Keys to Recovery continues to support them with a Rent Geared to Income subsidy, case management and financial assistance for items such as school books, bus tickets, work boots, work clothes, resume and interview preparation, etc.The 3rd and final phase is the Graduation Phase and is 5+ years in length. This phase involves the client completing post-secondary education, and becoming gainfully employed. The client is stable in their recovery, their employment, and their mental health. They are fully integrated into their communities and are able to be fully independent. They will then become Keys to Recovery Alumni and will be able to become a Peer Support for other Keys to Recovery clients.","DonateKeys to Recovery has set an initial goal of increasing the organizations annual budget by $500,000 for this year, which will greatly enhance the opportunities for the success of our clients to transition to normalized living in the community.

"70",655,"Calgary Mosquito Aircraft Society","RETAIN, RESTORE, HONOUR and EDUCATEAviation history is an important component of Canadas identity, especially our role during and after World War II. As time continues to march on, many of these marvelous war time machines and the valiant men who flew them are disappearing, taking with them the evocative and heroic stories of Canadas contribution to world history.In 1954, Spartan Aviation of Ottawa purchased 15 World War II Mosquito bomber aircraft from the British government and brought them to Canada to fulfill photo mapping contracts, in which, for the first time, all of Canada was mapped using aerial cameras. As world leaders in aerial photo mapping, Spartan used the aircraft throughout Northern Canada, West Africa, South and Central America until 1962.Upon retirement, one of the Mosquitoes was sold to a group in Calgary which sought to establish an aviation museum in the City. When this organization failed in the late 1960s, the City of Calgary took ownership and possession of the Mosquito and a dozen other vintage aircraft.In 2012, after a five year campaign to prevent the overseas sale of the aircraft, the City of Calgary signed a contract with the Calgary Mosquito Aircraft Society allowing us to take possession of the Mosquito and Hurricane so that they could finally be restored. The Society has subcontracted the restoration of the Hurricane to a professional aircraft restoration company in Wetaskiwin, AB while focusing its volunteer efforts on the restoration of the Mosquito in space provided by the Bomber Command Museum of Canada, located in Nanton, AB.The Hurricane will be restored as it served during WWII in 133 Squadron on Canadas west coast. The Mosquito will be restored as it flew and served in Canada with Spartan Air Services, making it the only non-military Mosquito in the world. The aircraft will not be flown, but both will be brought to ground running, or taxi status. Upon completion, both will be returned to the City of Calgary.If you are interested in following our progress, see us on Facebook  Calgary Mosquito Society, or at our website: http://calgarymosquitosociety.comOr on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/MossieSociety/","In addition to the physical restoration of the two aircraft, our mandate is also to Honour and Educate; Honour those who designed, built, flew and serviced these aircraft in wartime and in peace and to Educate ourselves and others about the significant place in Canadian history of these rare machines and the pivotal work they did.Since acquiring the aircraft in 2012, weve built new steel jigs for the Mosquito fuselage and wing, acquired a very rare original Wild aerial camera, tracked down and purchased wartime de Havilland specification birch plywood, scrounged missing parts from around the world and begun the delicate and exacting work of repairing the structural damage to the Mosquito fuselage. Weve sub-contracted the restoration of the Hurricane to Historic Aviation Services in Wetaskiwin, AB., while we retain the airplanes Merlin engine in Nanton where we have brought it back to running status so that visitors can enjoy the sight and sound of the Hurricanes mighty Merlin engine when the restoration is complete. As well we have been invited to numerous international conferences to speak not just about the aircraft and the work to preserve them but to share with museum professionals around the world our unique web of partnerships with government, business and other not for profits that allowed us to prevent the sale of these airplanes overseas, to raise all the money required to restore them and to put together a team to get it all done. Weve been told that our strategy and success in these areas is unique and based on results, very effective.","Volunteers with the Calgary Mosquito Aircraft Society meet at the Bomber Command Museum in Nanton on Tuesday evenings and Saturdays to work on the airplane.The Calgary Mosquito Society continues to educate and engage visitors through one on one contact with visitors, group tours, providing speakers and in creating a series of videos showcasing interviews with people who were involved with flying the Mosquito and Hurricane and with historians who have studied the people and the circumstances of the times.We have a series of 30 short videos, fifteen on each airplane, available on a touchscreen adjacent to the aircraft, uploaded to our YouTube channel and on DVD. Hear the harrowing tales of two of Canadas highest scoring WWII aces who actually flew these very airplanes. Learn about how Canada and Spartan Air Services were leading the world in the business and technology of aerial photo mapping in the 1950s and 60s and how this company ended up spanning the globe with its fleet of over 120 aircraft. Share in our pride as you hear about Elsie McGill, crowned Queen of the Hurricanes who in wartime had a comic book dedicated to her ground breaking work as Production Supervisor of Canadian made Hurricanes and likely the worlds first female aircraft design engineer. Weve raised all the money we need to restore both aircraft to running condition. Weve gathered an excellent team of professional engineers and enthusiastic amateurs to see the job done and to see these rare, historic and beautiful airplanes brought back to their former glory.","In the world of vintage aircraft, or warbirds, these are two of the rarest, most historic and beautiful flying machines ever created. Of the 7781 Mosquitoes built, just 30 remain today with only three currently in flying condition. Ours will be the only one restored to honour its place as a groundbreaking civilian workhorse.Over 14,500 Hurricanes were produced with only 45 surviving today. Though overshadowed by the Spitfire during the Battle of Britain, the Hurricane shot down more enemy aircraft than any other type and served in every theater of WWII from day one to its finish in August 1945.Imagine having a hand in bringing them back to life! Members are welcome to apply their skills, or learn some new ones. Weve been accused by critics who wanted to see the Mosquito sold to a collector in England of being overenthusiasitic amateurs. Weve put that on a shirt and wear it with pride! Imagine at the end of a voluteer work day, or when the aircraft are complete, being able to stand back with pride to say I had a hand in that. We guarantee a smile.Or come down any Saturday to witness history being rebuilt!

You feel worried because you dont think your parents will approve.Your family is conservative, and you have always felt worried that they would not approve of who you truly are. You often feel scared and isolated when you see your friends bullying other kids, and calling them gay. You feel like you are living two lives, and all the secrets are catching up with you. Then, all of your fears melt away when Danielle grabs your hand under the picnic table. The person you like likes you back. You are on top of the world.Your worst fears are confirmed when after the party, your mother and father confront you. They saw you holding hands with Danielle and they let you know in no uncertain terms that being gay is not apart of your familys values and if you continue You will no longer be welcome in the family or their home. You stop talking to Danielle and join your friends in bullying other schoolmates, worried that someone will find out the truth.The months that follow become increasingly more bleak. The loneliness of living in the shadows eats away at you. You are having trouble getting out of bed, cant help but feel like things would be easier if you werent around.

Your grades improve and you start to be interested in life again.You even mustered the courage to face your parents. Giving them information and resources. Eventually they start going to a support group for parents of gay children, and come to accept you for who you are.NOTES:Rates of suicide in Lesbian, Bisexual  Gay Youth are 14 times that of their heterosexual peers.

I learned from not only my own experience playing, listening to the judges, but also from the other playersif it werent for the Festival, I wouldnt have reached the level that I am at now. Yina Tong, 2006 Rose Bowl winner, New England Conservatory Masters grad and touring cellist.Education:The Festival encourages skill development in the performing arts for youth by providing a forum where they can perform, receive feedback from arts professionals, and learn from each other/peers.-----The [Calgary Performing Arts] Festival is a great place for young performers to learn, to work towards a goal and to make friends who share similar interests. Its also a great way for young performers to share their musical gifts with the community.  Scott MacIsaac, 2010 Rose Bowl winner, Yale School of Music grad and touring concert pianist.Supporting emerging artists: The Festival serves as a critical venue for emerging artists, e.g. the Festivals top prize, the Rose Bowl, comes with an opportunity to perform in concert with the Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra. Many internationally renowned musicians and singers started out performing at the Calgary Festival: Jane Coop, Susan Hoeppner, Michael Kim, Heather Schmidt, Annalee Patipatanakoon, and Jan Lisiecki.-----Having decided to go a different route and become an Engineer, I have found that some of the skills I learned through my festival years have served me exceptionally well. Having to prepare works of art and pay attention to every detail therein was a course in preparation I couldnt have taken at any school or university. My presentation skills and ability to highlight details are at a much higher level than they would have been without my many years of performing in the Festival. Not only did the Festival set me up for my career on a technical level, but music, performance and the combination of both through the Festival gave me a sense of self confidence that had never existed before. Aiofe Donnelly, Drilling EITLife Skills: Not every Festival participant is destined for life under the spotlight. Participation in the Festival enables young people to learn valuable life lessons such as setting goals, time management and the satisfaction of achieving those goals  skill sets they can apply to whatever profession they choose.-----Its a great festival. Its so unique and so much fun  its a really great experience for kids. It taught me so much. I really loved it. Alexander Malikov, Quarter-finalist in the 2015 Honens International Piano Competition.Arts appreciation: The Festival fosters appreciation of the performing arts by providing a positive experience for young people, who will carry these experiences into adulthood and become lifelong supporters of the arts.","With each annual Festival, we aspire to introduce a new generation of amateur artists to the joys of performance! Our Festival is one of the citys highest profile arts and culture events with over 10,000 performers taking part each year.The Festival began in 1931 with just over 200 entries and has since grown into one of North Americas largest amateur performing arts festivals. Our mission is to encourage amateur performance in our community.We do this by producing a three-week Festival each year to showcase the talents of approximately 10,000 young musicians, singers and drama students in over 3,700 performances. There over 15 performance categories including school bands, Chinese ethnic instruments, choral music, drama, guitar, musical theatre, piano, strings and woodwind to name just a few.For over 80 years the Festival has focused on expanding our categories so that we continue to reflect performance trends and the interests of our audience. Most recently in 2015, Festival added a popular guitar category to encourage students who are learning to play the guitar but are not interested in classical music. New classes for Chinese ethnic instruments were added a few years ago and prove to be very popular. More recently, performance piano, which is non-competitive and non-adjudicated, was added to give participants an opportunity to gain confidence from the experience of public performance without the pressure of being marked.A very important aspect of Festival for many young performers is the adjudication. We invite adjudicators, well-respected within in their field, to offer constructive oral and written feedback with the intention of nurturing the budding talent and growing passion for performance.Outside of Festival time, we host concerts and collaborate with local performing arts organizations so that we may provide Festival participants with additional opportunities to perform publicly and share their passion for the arts.Festival is a member of the Alberta Music Festival Association (AMFA) and the Federation of Canadian Music Festivals (FCMF) which provides those who excel locally with the opportunity to advance to the provincial or national levels.","Our Festival is generally held over a three-week period with classes running daily from 9:00a.m.  9:00 p.m. on eight different stages throughout the Mount Royal University campus. Classes vary and could consist of four elementary school choirs all singing two selections for the adjudicator in a large concert hall; or it could be a small group of grade three piano students, each playing a solo piece from the classical era; or it could be 15 musical theatre performers coming together to perform five different trios from Broadway plays.  We cover a wide range of performance categories and all are judged by renowned adjudicators from across North America such as Ray Luck, Zoltan Szabo, and Barbara Collier. These professionals share their knowledge and expertise with the students, providing valuable learning experiences for all. Each performance, whether it is a soloist or an entire group will receive both a written and oral adjudication pointing out what they did well and areas where they could still make some improvements.While most classes are competitive, the Festival also offers many non-competitive classes where students receive the same written and oral comments from the adjudicator but no marks are given.Public performance: There is no fee to come out and enjoy the classes and we invite Calgarians to come out and support our up and coming musicians and actors. Several public concerts annually are hosted annually (Stars of the Festival, Musical Theatre Showcase, Speech Performers Showcase) featuring top performers heard and seen at that years Festival.Media coverage: The Festival and its performers are well loved by local media and their readers and are regularly featured in print, radio and TV broadcasts around Festival time and throughout the year.Cultural outreach: The Festival conducts targeted outreach to cultural communities (publishing Chinese language ads and syllabus materials, partnering with cultural groups to offer scholarships).Scholarships: Each year approximately $55,000 is awarded in scholarships to help nurture emerging artists and encourage the continued pursuit of their studies.Continued growth: Festival aspires to introduce a new generation of Calgarians to the joys of performance by:Expanding outreach efforts directed at private music teachers and their students, who account for a large number of participants in the Festival.Creating more non-competitive/non-adjudicated classes in disciplines in addition to piano.Establishing new partnerships with local performing arts organizations and cultural groups in order to reach more performers and increase the number of opportunities for Festival participants to perform.Continuing to create new classes and expanding performance categories based on the students needs and interests.","The Calgary Performing Arts Festival is always seeking additional sponsors, donors and in-kind contributions to help stretch our budget.Scholarships: Festival is specifically looking for $500+ principal scholarships for musical theatre, chamber and choral classes.Donations: Help cover the costs associated with venue rentals, adjudication fees and expenses, and the scholarships awarded by giving what you can.Corporate and title sponsors: Festival requires more corporate sponsors who wish to support a well-loved community arts organization.

"73",822,"Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra","Music can transport you to a time or place in your life. Its like a time capsule that takes you to a memory or physical feeling that sometimes you can even taste, smell and hear. Can you remember the first time you walked in the concert hall, sat in your seat, heard the humming sound of strings tuning, people chatting and the steps of the Conductor walking across the stage to his podium. And finally, that silent pause of anticipation waiting for the Orchestra to begin? Thenthe music starts. Maybe this reminds you of your mother, your daughter, son or dad. The Calgary Phil has seats to epic classics, blockbuster pops and family favourites. The journey is up to you.","The Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra has been a cornerstone of Calgarys multi-faceted arts community since 1955 and is one of North Americas finest and most versatile live music ensembles. A repertoire that is extensive and broad in scope consistently attracts acclaimed guest artists and conductors. From classical giants to rock and roll hits and family favourites, the Calgary Philharmonic offers an average of 85 concerts per Season designed to fit all musical tastes.The Calgary Philharmonic was created in the 1955 merger of the Alberta Philharmonic and the Calgary Symphony. Performing in Calgarys Grand Theatre to a small but enthusiastic audience at first, the Calgary Philharmonic gained wider attention in 1957 with the completion of its first home, the Jubilee Auditorium. As the audience grew and public acclaim heightened, in 1985 the Calgary Philharmonic moved to its permanent home in Arts Commons (formerly EPCOR CENTRE for the Performing Arts) Jack Singer Concert Hall, one of North Americas most acoustically acclaimed venues.","Education ConcertsEach season we welcome more than 10,000 students from across Calgary and Alberta into the concert hall as part of its EducationSeries Concerts.

Phil Watt didnt start off on the right track.I remember taking my first lollipop from the store when I was not even in school, the 17-year-old remembers. If you told me not to do something, I wanted to do it that much more.His father was involved with drugs and had gang affiliations in Calgarymeaning his mother was left to raise him on her own. Watt started sneaking out and failing school.Every day I got a call - they had me on speed dial, his mother Kristen Luu says. Stealing peoples lunches, getting in fights with kidsgrounding him didnt work, taking away privileges didnt work, he would just defy me.At age 12, Watt was caught shoplifting at Chinook Centre, and police concluded he was a high risk to become a gang member. But instead of sending him through the court system, they paired him up with the Calgary Police Youth at Risk Development Program (YARD). Cst. Al Devolin spent time with Watt, got him and his mother into counselling and set him up with a tutor. Not only did Watts grades shoot way up, but hes become an accomplished track-and-field athlete. He also has a new outlook.I was so blinded by I am the ruler, the world revolves around me. I look back and go wow, I was egotistic.Devolin says that early intervention is important.The earlier you get to the young guy in the family, the easier it is to turn things around, he explains. This is the gold standard. This is what we would like for all of our families and kids to achieve. Thats the hope.Watt says all that he has achieved so far is just the beginning.I know exactly where I should be and where I could go. I would rather be on the side where people respect me.According to his mother, as of 2015, Phil is on the Deans list in Chemical Engineering with a super high GPA.Story written by Nancy Hixt, Global TV Calgary","OUR PURPOSE: Safe kids, safe families, safe Calgary.OUR MANDATE: The Calgary Police Foundation is an independent entity that partners exclusively with the Calgary Police Service.

"75",596,"Calgary Pregnancy Care Centre","I made the very difficult, but brave, call to the Calgary Pregnancy Care Centre 17 years ago when I was facing an unplanned pregnancy. The love and support I received (and still receive 17 years later), surrounding my choice to place for open adoption, was necessary to get me through facing the pain of the loss of my son. I joined the Birth Moms support group during my pregnancy, which I still attend to this day, where a lifelong bond developed with other beautiful strong women who have gone through the same thing that I did. We candidly share the heart felt pains and gains of our adoptions. We cry, grieve and support each other with total love and understanding. Without the CPCC, I really dont know how my life would have played out--if I had not received the unconditional love that I did, even though I felt I didnt deserve it. As hard as it was for me to reach out and ask for help at the time, I had to put my pride aside and just pick up the phone and dial, because there are some things in life you cant go through alone!- Calgary Pregnancy Care Centre ClientI was working as a volunteer for CPCC when I found out that my own 15-year old daughter was pregnant. We instantly became clients, and both my daughter and I received individual counselling and support from the moment we expressed a need. They stayed involved with us throughout the entire experience, and we are both still friends with our counselors. My daughter delivered her son almost nine years ago.

They saw the Library cause asan investmentfor their families and thegenerations of Calgarians that would follow and successfully secured community support for Albertas first public library and obtained the financial donation from the Carnegie Foundation.The Library Foundation was created in 1999 to provide an opportunity for individuals, businesses and foundations to participate in building a library system for today and future generations. Funds raised by the Library Foundation do not replace the Librarys core funding, but enhance collections, programs and services.

"77",641,"Calgary Reads (An Early Literacy Initiative) Society","At our last distribution day before the holidays of our Calgary Reads Book Bank, in collaboration with the Calgary Food Bank, a mom of seven children stopped by to talk; she had a passion for literacy that was truly inspiring. She told us that she shared the joy of reading with each of her children from the day they were born. She reads to her children daily. She has set up three different areas at home with bookshelves and comfortable seating so that her children can escape into a book whenever they want. At Calgary Reads we call literate-rich environments like she described Reading Places.At Calgary Reads, we help get books into the hands of Calgary children who have few or none of their own. Access to books is important because children need to grow up with lots of books to build their brains, develop language skills, get ready for school and to become lifelong readers. A 20-year study across 27 countries found that the mere presence of books profoundly impacts a childs school achievement. Yet in low income neighbourhoods there can be as few as one book for every 300 children. Yes, you read that right . . . and it means that thousands of children in Calgary have not a single book to write their name inside; which also means they cant keep the book forever, or reread it over and over again until it becomes their cherished favourite.","Calgary Reads is an early-literacy initiative. Our vision is of a community where all children read with confidence and joy!Our work is needed because:49% of adult Canadians have low literacy skillsAlbertas high school completion rate of 75% is one of the lowest in Canada29% of Albertas children arrive at Kindergarten without the strong foundation they need to be successfulIt takes all of us (parents, schools and the community) to help children read with confidence and joy because children spend 900 hours in school and 7,800 outside school each year.While teachers care about reading and help children learn to read, they have lots of responsibilities and competing priorities. Teachers have busy, full classrooms and sometimes children that are under-prepared for schoolor, falling behind. We work closely with teachers to decide which children will most benefit from our programs. And, one teacher in each school (where we are active) becomes the coordinator who works closely with us to implement Calgary Reads programs, initiatives and events with their students and school families.Calgary Reads began in 1998 as an early-literacy initiative. Our founders identified the need for reading help in the early grades. And, we are still the only in-school, one-on-one tutor program with trained volunteers. Weve grown of course. Today, Calgary Reads has lots of effective programs, initiatives, events, resources and professional learning opportunities. Were a vibrantmultifaceted reading movement!Sadly too, many children in Calgary have no or few books in their homes; we know that access to quality print materials and books is essential to help children build their reading skills and develop a love of books and learning. So, we also help get books into the hands of children who would love to have their own.Our work is critical because literacy is linked to a range of personal, social and financial benefits, from positive self-esteem to ongoing employment, good health, community engagement, reduced crime rates and even a stronger national economy. Calgary Reads is becoming part of the provincial literacy landscape, bridgingthe great dividebetweenhome and school.So: we work with schools, the community, post-secondary institutions, business partners and volunteers  because we all have a part to play in helping children become confident and joyful readers!Watch our Read Aloud video and learn more about the power of reading aloud with the children in your life.","In addition to our programs, collaborative events, initiatives and services  we stimulate a reading revival movement.We are most well-known for our signature in school one-on-one tutoring program Read Up! that pairs trained volunteer tutors with a struggling reader in Grade 1 or 2. This tutoring occurs regularly over several weeks. Its active in lots of schools. Children work with their tutor long-term to reach their appropriate reading level or beyond! As their reading skill develops, so too does their confidence. Most of the tutored children no longer fear reading; they are avid book lovers, seek out new material and start to recommend stories and nonfiction topics to their friends (and tutor!).Our wee read program has employee teams, and other volunteers trained to read aloud and have conversations with (the same) Kindergarten children, once a week for eight weeks. This is a gem of a program because the training is quick and easy for volunteers and the pleasure for them and the children, so immediate. Imagine little ones who are rarely read to at home. Or, perhaps not read to in English. They have this wonderfully keen new friend who comes regularly to read and talk about stories. Its the perfect early stage to help children see reading and books as a time of great pleasure, caring and learning. Last year almost 3,000 Kindergarten children were read to regularly by 905 trained volunteers including 539 high school students! Now these Kindergarten children are ready for Grade 1 and prepared to build their reading and learning skills.Our Read Every Day That you Eat initiative is a collaborative project with the Calgary Food Bank. Together, we get books into the hands of children who have none or few of their own. Our Literacy Coaches, regularly on site at the Calgary Food Bank, share reading tips and resources with parents and caregivers so they can help their children with reading at home. And, we invite children to pick their own books from age-appropriate quality ones we provide. It helps each child bond to the book they choose and be keen to read it, or have it read to them. Often we read aloud to a child too! Community members and corporate partners support this work by holding book drives and donating new and like-new books for children age 0-8 to us.Our Literacy-in-a-Box modules help teachers implement fun, family literacy nights at school. The various themes and activities help build literacy skills, school community, and share ideas with parents too.Calgary Reads Reading Rally events in schools are large scale celebrations of reading. Groups of volunteers read aloud to small groups of children and a special guest reader shares a story with everyone. Teachers perform a Readers Theatre too. Watch our video and see members of the Calgary Police Service sharing their love of reading and books!We provide Learning Opportunities for teachers and pre-service educators too. We bring in literacy experts, thought-leaders and other teachers doing great work to help children read with confidence and joy. Our attendees tell us how they value the new research and creative techniques and the opportunity to network and share best practices with their peers.And, out in the community we have volunteers who help us drop free books for children and families to find, enjoy and keep or share with others. We also host Random Acts of Reading out on the street  so we can share the love of books and inspire others to read . . . especially with the children in their lives. We also make resources available on our website to parents, caregivers, teachers and tutors.","Imagine reading aloud to a small child and seeing their eyes open wide in amazement. You get to share the delight as they talk with you and imagine what comes next in the story or laugh as the hero takes a spill. You may find you revisit your childhood reading memories, to talk about favourite stories and help children discover the wonder of books.Its so meaningful too, to know you are inspiring a young reader. Perhaps youll help them build their skills for reading. Or, show them that books are such a source of pleasure and new discovery. Imagine becoming a new friend to a small child who rarely has someone spend quality time just with them.-----There are so many ways you can join us and help! Of course, we do seek funding for our programs and operations and to help us expand our reach and impact.The volunteer opportunities with us are wonderful too!And, if you want to do other things to help us  you can.

"78",791,"Calgary Rotary Challenger Park Society","As one of the original patrons of Calgary Rotary Challenger Park (CRCP), I have experienced and been witness to the many changes the Park has gone through and continues to do so to meet funding demands, restraints, and the needs of the community at large.Since the beginning, the CRCP has been a unique concept of athletic fields, a vast recreational area, a specialized playground, tennis and basketball courts, baseball and softball diamonds, dressing, locker and shower rooms, cricket pitch, a football and soccer field, track and field, visitors centre, picnic areas, and other amenities, all constructed to ensure that all citizens regardless of age or ability have equal access to education, recreation, sport and play.But the Park is more than all of the physical aspects it provides, it is a model of community inclusiveness. From inception this Park has been built with the idea that it is inclusive so people with disabilities and the community at large can participate and experience recreation and sport and all it has to offer with friends, family and community members in a barrier-free environment.  - Story by Cal Schuler:---Calgary Rotary Challenger Park (CRCP or the Park) is a unique concept of multi-purpose area constructed on 23+ acres of land donated by the Calgary Airport Authority to ensure that all citizens have equal access to recreation, sport and play. The idea of CRCP was conceived in 1997/98 by the caring and community focused Rotary Clubs of Calgary/Airdrie, the City of Calgary and the Calgary Airport Authority.From inception the Park was built with the idea that it is inclusive so people with disabilities and seniors can participate and experience recreation and sport and all it has to offer with friends, family and community members in a barrier free environment. This is illustrated by a story of one of our longest standing park patrons (see above).","The Park provides: Accessible sport and recreational facilities for all and is recognized as the best barrier-free sport and recreational facility.Calgary Rotary Challenger Park is a barrier free meeting and recreational facility that is accessible to all people regardless of their age or ability.

As a follow up to the current parks facilities we are now moving to develop a state-of-the-art Centre that uniquely serves the nonprofit sector in the greater Calgary area while utilizing the best barrier-free sport and recreation facility. This project is called the Centre For All Abilities.The Centre for All Abilities (CAA) at Calgary Rotary Challenger Park is set to be located at 48th Avenue and 36th Street N.E., virtually in the centre of the northeast quadrant of Calgary. The Park was created from the vision of Rotarians in Calgary and Airdrie to provide a barrier-free sports facility for all Calgarians, but especially those with disabilities. The Centre is intended to be an expansion of this vision.The Park has hosted over 500,000 visits from over 80 different organizations over the last 10 years!The next step is where the magic will happen  by bringing together a diverse group of nonprofit organizations, under one roof.These nonprofit organizations will continue to serve their distinct communities and stakeholders, but will have the opportunity to cost-share, collaborate and develop synergistic opportunities to aid these organizations in becoming more efficient and effective in their operations. These organizations will also enjoy a significant reduction in rent (of at least 40% off current market value in the NE quadrant of Calgary). On top of those benefits, there will be the free parking for clients, guests and staff and long-term leases that will provide a significant level of stability and certainty.Here is a chance to JOIN our team in bring this new Centre to the nonprofit sector in Calgary.

"80",390,"Calgary Seniors' Resource Society ","This is Frank. Frank is 80 years old and lives alone with no family. It was his bank who first noticed that Frank was in trouble. Over the course of a year he has lost $21,000 in scam emails, calls and letters. The bank representative that Frank dealt had completed the online SeniorConnect training that we offer at Calgary Seniors Resource Society. It only takes about 30 minutes, but it teaches participants how to recognize the signs and symptoms of a senior who may need assistance. As a result of the training, the bank knew to call the Seniors Help Line and report their concerns. As a result of that call, a SeniorConnect social worker was dispatched to Franks house and completed an assessment. The social worker made several referrals for Frank and he now has a proper diagnosis (he is in the early stages of dementia), proper medication, a trustee, and a home care team. Frank is also now an Escorted Transportation client of Calgary Seniors, as he can no longer drive. This completes the circle as Franks volunteer driver is also SeniorConnect Connector and can work in conjunction with his social work team to ensure Frank thrives.Many of our clients stories involved more serious issues, such as elder abuse, addiction, metal health and economic circumstances. These are seniors who are the most vulnerable and require our entire community to support them.Our Impact in 2014:Volunteer Services saw 309 new clients.500 volunteers contributed over 45,000 hoursof service to seniors.1,548 EscortedTransportation appointments were completed,covering 80,000 km.We provided long-term case support to 245 seniors and responded to 216 seniors requiring urgent response and crisis management.Calgary Seniors provided education to over 2000 peoplein the community on the risks and dangers some seniorsface as they age.","What makes our approach so unique is that we support seniors to live independently in the community to the greatest extent possible by combining social work and volunteer programs that work in conjunction with each other. This means we can not only help in a crisis, but we follow-up with long-term support.In addition to social work support with critical needs like housing, pension  benefit applications, etc., Calgary Seniors also provides companionship and social support through our volunteer programs like Friendly Visiting, Escorted Transportation, Pet Assist and Adopt a Grandparent.","Calgary Seniors helps seniors, generally in the age range of 65+, remain independent at home. We end senior isolation in our city as our clients have little or no family or friends in the city able or willing to assist them. Some of our clients are of an income level that they cannot afford to pay for services from for-profit organizations providing similar programs. If you or someone you love meets these eligibility requirements or wish to discuss your eligibility further with our staff please read on to learn about the programs and services we offer.Christmas Cheer Up Our annual Christmas program ensures isolated seniors do not spend the holidays alone. With a stockingfull of gifts and a visit from a volunteer over the holiday season we bring joy and caring to a seniors home to let them know they are not forgotten.Spring Clean Up/Fall Fix Up Spring Clean Up engages volunteer groups to help seniors with cleaning and light landscaping projects around their home. Fall Fix Up ensures seniors who need small renovation projects completed get the help they need.Working with corporate partners and local home builders we ensure that all renovations are completed by trained professionals. These projects help maintain seniors homes, keep them safe and inspire pride in our communities.Friendly VisitingOur companionship program matches a senior with a caring volunteer who visits once a week for an hour. Thistime spent together greatly reduces the seniors isolation and creates a wonderful relationship that is mutually beneficial.Assisted ShoppingSeniors are matched with a volunteer who takes them shopping for groceries and other critical items every twoweeks. The volunteers provide more than transportation, helping the senior as they shop and with putting awaytheir items when they return home. As well as offering critical transportation for the senior, the program also offers social support. These bi-weekly visits are something they look forward to as a wonderful opportunity to spend time witha friend.Telephone Reassurance Seniors are matched one on one with a volunteer who will phone regularly at an agreed upon time to provide afriendly voice, willing ear and of course, peace of mind that someone will be checking in.Escorted Transportation Seniors are provided with round trip, arm in arm rides to medical appointments from volunteers. It offers seniorswho have no other options a way to access critical medical support, which otherwise they would have to go without. The senior pays a $10 gas recovery fee for every ride.Pet Assist The correlation between a high quality of life and owning a pet cannot be underestimated, a need that is often overlooked. This program provides volunteers to assist isolated and low income seniors with their pet care needs. This might include weight management, exercise, monitoring medication and other treatment and providing support during and after vet visits.Take Care Be Aware! The focus of Take Care, Be Aware! Is to educate seniors about the realities of fraud and financial abuse, and what steps they can take to protect themselves. Using a seniors helping seniors model, volunteers will present information on current frauds, red flags to watch for, tips for prevention and host an interactive conversation with the group.Information and Referral Seniors and their families can call Calgary Seniors for information and referrals to community resources andservices available to them in Calgary. We provide a wide array of programs and if we do not offer the service youneed we can connect you with the people who will.OutreachOur team of Outreach workers provides services to seniors and their families who live in the north east and upper south east areas of Calgary. Our workers provide information and long-term support while connecting seniors to the services and resources that they need in order to remain independent and active within in their community. Outreach services may include helping the senior with:Applying for eligible financial benefits;Applying for suitable housing and transportation;Accessing Home Care and mobility aids;Supporting mental health and access for treatment;Elder Abuse education and support;Preventing and reducing Isolation and Loneliness;Caregiver support;Supportive Counselling.SeniorConnectThe SeniorConnect program offers a channel for concerned citizens to take action on behalf of a senior who may be at risk, or in crisis, in the community. Through community mobilization, SeniorConnect, and the Distress Centre 24-hr help line, allows for a timely referral and follow-up from a registered social worker who begins working with the senior to address immediate concerns, stabilize a crisis, and secure ongoing community supports.Free education on how to identify a senior who may be at risk is available online at: seniorconnectcalgary.org or by contacting Calgary Seniors.","Volunteer We would not be able to do our work without the support of hundreds of passionate and dedicated volunteers across the city.

"81",726,"Calgary Sexual Health Centre","The tension was palpable. Each week we start with a check-in where the boys can talk about whats going on in their lives. It was clear from the moment I walked in the door that there would be lots to talk about this week.Willie and Ralph, long time friends, were sitting opposite each other. Willie, sitting alone next to me, was accused of spreading false rumors about Ralph and a girl. Ralph was with the other boys sitting as judge and jury.The boys are negotiating the powerful feelings that accompany right and wrong, afraid to be vulnerable, to be seen as weak. They want to repair their friendship but dont know how to without losing face. Heck Im twice their age and its still hard for me.While Im sitting there, trying to keep order, this situation seems all too familiar. Im the participant observer of my own stubbornness, the facade of strength and righteousness that leaves little space to listen and no room for empathy.As I move from observer to facilitator everything begins to shift. Feeling words start to emerge  I feel frustrated, angry, pissed-off. Its no longer about whos right or wrong, this is about how it feels to be in a fight with your friend.As the two boys talk about their feelings, anger and fear give way to understanding. Willie recognizes that his actions have hurt his friend. He comes to appreciate Ralphs anger and in the safety of our meeting he apologizes. He opens up to the group and admits that sometimes he talks without thinking and that hes working on it.In that moment of honesty and vulnerability Ralph says, I accept your apology and we can be friends again, but I just might not talk to you for a while.Ten minutes later they are laughing and joking together in class.How many times have I fought with someone I cared about, focused on defending my position and ignoring their feelings? I wish I had had someone to facilitate these conversations, to help me to see the hurt and share my feelings, to repair my friendships.Calgary Sexual Health sees the value of creating safer spaces for people to share, be curious, and show empathy towards each other. Im grateful to be a part of offering this time and space to others.","The Calgary Sexual Health Centre is a nationally recognized, community based organization delivering programs and services addressing sexual health issues in a comprehensive way.

"82",769,"Calgary Silver Linings Foundation","It started innocuously enough  some leftover food on her plate at dinner, an extra work out here and there. Only it didnt end there. It hasnt ended.Eventually, my teenage daughter, Madison, wasted away to a mere 90 pounds from restricted eating and obsessive over exercising. With a heart rate of 32 beats per minute, my beautiful, brilliant girl collapsed and was rushed to the emergency department at the Foothills Hospital. After a 52-hour stay in the emergency department with no available hospital bed, she was diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa and I was told she would need to be hospitalized.Devastatingly, there were no beds available in the Eating Disorder (ED) program. Instead, my 16 year old was admitted to the psychiatric ward at the Rockyview Hospital where she received little support for her eating disorder and was released 5 days later. This cycle repeated itself three more times.Finally, a bed opened up in the ED Program where Madison spent the following six weeks becoming medically stable, meaning that while she was no longer in immediate risk of dying, her illness raged on untreated.After trying every locally available avenue for treatment, it became apparent that Madison needed more intensive treatment than what was currently being offered. We sought treatment outside of province, where Madison lived in a residential treatment centre for six months. I followed her, of course, quitting my job, trusting that my other child would be fine without me. I rented an apartment close to the treatment centre.My lost income, my daughters medical fees, our expenses relocating for six months - none of this was covered through her medical insurance, but I was desperate to help Madison overcome this deadly disease before it overcame her and our family. The financial costs exceeded $150,000. The emotional costs remain immeasurable.After maneuvering through the various channels of the health care system, I met many other parents dealing with the same issues. Some of their children had managed to recover through residential treatment outside the province, most were still caught up in the endless cycle of hospital readmissions and temporary stabilization. The parents of male patients had horror stories beyond even what I could imagine.In 2014, these passionate, like-minded parents, who had been through similar heart-wrenching and difficult journeys, joined to form the Calgary Silver Linings Foundation to address current systemic gap in Alberta in treating eating disorders. Our goal is to establish Albertas first residential treatment centre for eating disorders to ensure other families have easier, more affordable and faster access to treatment for their children. Our goal is to save lives.The name of the foundation reflects the hope that the process of recovery and family therapy, personal foundations and relationships can become stronger and patients and their families can recover  with the proper treatment. Althoughsometimes difficult to see, there is a silver lining in this journey. A residential treatment centre for Albertans can provide those families caught in the nightmare of trying to save their child from the mental illness with the highest mortality rate with a silver lining  a locally based, affordable treatment program for their children.","The Calgary Silver Linings Foundation (CSLF) is working collaboratively to create a world-class residential eating disorder treatment centre in Alberta and to bridge the gap in accessibility and care of eating disorders.More than 30,000 Albertans (male and female) suffer from eating disorders, with no specialized provincial residential treatment facility for the illness. Calgary Silver Linings Foundation is the only Alberta foundation working towards the establishment of the provinces first eating disorder residential treatment centre in Southern Alberta.Many Alberta youth suffer from severe eating disorders and building a residential treatment centre in Southern Alberta for at-risk youth is the first critical step in filling the systemic gap in services and reducing the number of repeat hospital admissions and deaths. The rate of girls between 10-19 years-old who had to be hospitalized from 2007-2013 increased by 42%. More than one-quarter of hospital emergency visits in Alberta for eating disorders include an admission to hospital for inpatient care and the average stay in hospital is 33 days. Eating disorders have the highest risk of mortality of any mental illness and residential treatment is necessary to break the cycle of hospital readmissions.There are only four specialized residential treatment centres in Canada and most no longer accept out-of-province patients, leaving Alberta parents the limited option of going for treatment in the U.S., often unfeasible for many families. Treatment takes an average of three to six months. Shortly after setting up the foundation, the Board of Directors organized an open house with the community of people affected directly by an eating disorder. This community conversation validated their intent as a priority of the community.Donations to CSLF will go directly towards the capital costs associated with building Albertas first residential treatment centre for eating disorders, including site purchase or leasehold improvements of a partner and program design.","1.

"83",305,"Calgary Society Of Independent Filmmakers","CSIF was founded in 1978 by a collective of twelve filmmakers who saw the growing need for film resources and film equipment in Calgary. From our humble beginnings in a church basement, we have grown over the last 36-years to become a vital hub for both emerging and established filmmakers working in Calgary.When the $100 Film Festival was born in 1992, it showcased eight short films on Super 8. The name sprung from the challenge to shoot a short film on four rolls of Super 8  which tallied to the cost of $100. The festival is now an international celebration of creative expression on celluloid.In 1998 CSIF partnered with the Gay and Lesbian Services Community Association to present the first annualFairyTales International Queer Film Festival, which has since set out on its own to become one of the leading LGBT film festivals in Canada.Many of our members have gone on to excel in the Canadian independent film industry due to their hard work and imagination, aided by CSIFs focus on production, exhibition and providing resources and support. Members today are still benefiting from this focus and, as their technical needs diversify and change, CSIF attempts to keep up with these changes.Now approaching our 40th year of operation, we have become an integral part of the infrastructure and ecosystem of the greater Calgary Film and Media community, boasting over 200 members and counting. Visit us at our new offices in Sunalta - we are excited to talk about new collaborations and opportunities!CSIF has evolved into a hub for all kinds of filmmakers, and we must continue to support it so that it can, in turn, help churn out the next brilliant film from this community. We must continue to make films, films that tell the stories of who we are, films that push boundaries and challenge the status quo, that perhaps even inspire positive change in ourselves or how we view the world.  - Filmmaker Corey Lee for FFWD Weekly","Our Mission: We are an inclusive, non-profit, arts-based society that exists to encourage filmmaking as art, reflecting and challenging our changing cultural landscape through production, exhibition and distribution of the filmmakers work.Our operations fall into two major categories:Production: equipment rentals, workshops, clubs, mentorships, networking opportunitiesExhibition: yearly programming, $100 Film Festival, film library, community engagement and outreachWith the help of our equipment and resources, our approximately 200 members produce over 100 productions per year, including short films, documentaries, television shows, web series, music videos, and feature films. Weve seen great international success from many of our longtime members, including Michael Dowse (GOON, FUBAR), Gary Burns (WAYDOWNTOWN, RADIANT CITY) and Kyle Thomas (THE VALLEY BELOW).Our diverse programming reaches over 3000 people per year in the Calgary area. We also strive to reach underrepresented communities in Alberta by programming events in partnership with First Nations communities. Growing our scope to a national level, we have completed several touring projects that have reached audiences at partner film societies across Canada.Beyond contributing to a sense of community for our members,we offer access to educational workshops and clubs for all skill levels(including learning the techniques of 8mm and 16mm filmmaking), production andpost-production equipment rentals, mentorships, and screening programming thatoften showcases our members work.Aided by our focus on skill-based workshops, production, andexhibition, many CSIF members have gone on to excel in the Canadian independentfilm industry. Members today are still benefiting from our focus on andcommitment to technical skill, access to information, and mentorship.With so much freedom to explore arenas of interest, the creative flow gives way to an impressive amount of output. In a world where grants and opportunity come to those who have performed in the professional and oftentimes cut-throat business of film, CSIF is quietly but effectively bringing a large amount of work to the table that is created with a sense of community and enthusiasm.           Jennie Orton, Beatroute Magazine","Our array of production and exhibition programs, resources and outreach efforts stimulate film production, and contribute to the overall creative landscape in Calgary:Equipment rentals: CSIF has a large collection of professional, high-end equipment for rent at highly discounted non-commercial rates. Our members have access to both film-based, and digital cameras, lighting, grip gear, as well as to in-house editing and transfer suites.Workshops: CSIF offers year-round workshops in all aspects of the filmmaking field: preproduction workshops including screenwriting, grantwriting and planning, technical workshops for the production process, as well as assistance with post-production and distribution. Our workshops are often taught by past or present CSIF members who have honed their craft enough to give back to the community.Clubs: CSIF encourages participation in our member driven drop-in clubs that encourage a collaborative approach to scriptwriting and experimenting with film. We also offer a drop-in Friday afternoon social where filmmakers can meet and network. Funding Opportunities: Our Production Access Fundoffers non-monetary production assistance in four categories semi-annually: Fish Fund, Cultural Equity Fund, Aboriginal Voices Fund and LGBTTQ Fund. This initiative helps to stimulate important creative growth for underrepresented groups within Calgary.CSIF also partners with the ImagineNATIVE Film + Media Art festival in Toronto to offer one First Nations filmmaker per year an opportunity to create and showcase an original short film with cash, equipment access and mentorship support.Youth Engagement: Each year CSIF offers our Summer Media Arts Camp.

"84",749,"Calgary Urban Project Society (CUPS)","Lisa* came to CUPS desperate, determined and 5 months pregnant. She was living at an addictions recovery facility, which she would have to leave once her child was born. Her family had disowned her and she was avoiding her friends as they were all associated with a lifestyle she was fighting to leave behind. Time was passing quickly, where would she and her newborn go?Lisa had struggled with drug and alcohol addictions for almost 10 years. As a young teenager, she had been sexually assaulted, an event that had consequences into her adult life. By 20, she was in a highly dysfunctional and abusive relationship. She stayed in it for almost 7 years, turning to drugs and alcohol to cope. The relationship ended and other abusive relationships took its place. By then, Lisa was entrenched in a pattern of addiction and crisis followed by sobriety and relapse.I got lost somewhere along the way. I was a mess.Finding out that she was pregnant jarred Lisa out of her patterns. She quit drinking and using as soon as she found that she was pregnant. When the babys father wouldnt commit to doing the same and was not supportive, she left him and lost her apartment. She also lost one of her two minimum wage jobs due to medical complications with her pregnancy. Clean and sober, her life remained filled with uncertainty and struggle, but she was determined to get her act together before her child was born.I was desperate. I didnt know where to go or what to do. CUPS worked a miracle for me. I felt blessed that day.CUPS Housing found subsidized housing for Lisa through a partner agency. At CUPS Family Development Centre, Lisa signed up for an intensive parenting program. When she found out about CUPS voluntary drug testing program for pre-natal women at the Womens Health Clinic, she moved her medical care to CUPS. Lisa had no idea how these positive choices were going to impact her in the very near future.If you can believe it, I was so excited about the drug testing. It would help keep me accountable.Lisa was housed 2 months before her baby was due. With no family contact and still avoiding former friends, she was very isolated. For many addicts, isolation is enough to trigger a relapse, but Lisa remained determined.It was easier being alone than even having one person around who wasnt a positive influence. I kept so busy working, being in pain, being tired.Towards the end of her pregnancy, Lisa worked hard to reconnect with her parents; this was another choice that she didnt yet know the full consequences of. Initially, they were very wary and not impressed with her unexpected pregnancy, but they opened themselves to her and their unborn grandchild.Soon after, Lisa delivered a healthy baby. At the hospital, she had packed her things, her newborn was in a car seat ready to go and her parents were waiting to drive them home. She was told that a social worker was coming to see her, a normal procedure she thought, but the meeting kept being delayed. When the social worker finally arrived, Lisa was happy to see her and to be that much closer to going home, until she was informed that the woman worked for Child and Family Services and was there to apprehend her child.I went to hospital in labour. I was doing all the right things. Id been clean and sober for almost 8 months. Then they showed up to take my baby away.Lisa was stunned. She had not been expecting Child and Family Services involvement, much less for her baby to be apprehended. She was told that she had been flagged due to the babys fathers suspected criminal activity and she was told facts about his past that she had been completely unaware of.Three hours of intensive interviewing of Lisa and her parents followed. Lisa relayed what she had undertaken: getting clean and sober as soon as she discovered that she was pregnant, leaving the unsupportive father, getting into a addictions recovery facility, finding safe and suitable housing for herself and her child, working with CUPS, undergoing voluntary drug testing throughout her pregnancy, registering to attend CUPS parenting program, re-establishing a relationship with her parents and working to regain their trust, and no longer associating with anyone involved in her previous lifestyle. It was agreed that she would also begin counselling and join a relapse prevention group.Finally, Lisa and her baby got to go home, but not to their home. An order had been placed; Lisa and her baby would have to stay with her parents.I was really working hard to get my life together. I had done it all by myself, and then my parents had to step up yet again to help me out. I did it all on my own, but the only way I could keep my child was to rely on my parents.Following confirmation of Lisas claims and drug test results and further interviewing, Lisa retained guardianship of her child, but was mandated to stay with her parents for the next 6 months.I said to myself, you know what, you put yourself here whichever way you look at it. Even though I was doing well now, look at my past. My child was with me, not gone, not with somebody else. So I couldnt really complain. There was no reason for me to complain. I cant just sit there and be mad at the world. It all starts with me.The 6 months passed without incident and Lisa and her baby were allowed to leave her parents house and finally move into her apartment. Lisa completed 8 months of counselling with a focus on cognitive therapy, which she found very helpful. Her relationship with her parents continued to strengthen. She finished with her relapse group and joined a trauma group. She graduated from CUPS Nurturing Parenting Program and feels that the program taught and supported her a great deal in her role as a new mother.Ive made a lot of changes, a lot more than I ever did before. You have to be really serious about making changes, 150% committed. You have to change everything. Ive heard that a million times before, from past addicts, from agencies, from people. Now I know its true.Lisa applied for CUPS Lorraine Melchior Bursary Fund and returned to school to upgrade with the intention of then attending university. Knowing that she would either need to return to work or go to school, Lisa wisely put her child on a nursery school waiting list last year. Lisa has completely changed her life and defined a new future for herself. CUPS Bursary Fund will assist with child care costs and groceries for the next year or so. After that, Lisa will probably be fully incorporated into mainstream society and no longer require CUPS assistance.Lisa arrived at CUPS highly motivated. She was ready to engage with any programs that would support her desire to change her life. With CUPS support, Lisa has achieved her goal and is well on her way to realizing her potential as an individual, a daughter and a mother. As a supporter of CUPS, you are also responsible for changing Lisa and her childs lives for the better. In supporting CUPS, you have made a new and brighter future possible for Lisa and her child. We thank you for the crucial difference you have made.","CUPS helps vulnerable and marginalized individuals and families in Calgary overcome poverty. CUPS was founded in 1989 as a grassroots response to inner-city poverty by medical professionals and faith-based groups. Today, CUPS is a vibrant, multifaceted, and innovative organization offering evidence-based programs and services spanning health, education, and housing. CUPS serves over 7,000 low-income Calgarians each year.CUPS PHILOSOPHY: Engage. Motivate. AchieveEngage: CUPS seeks to provide engaging programs and services for impoverished Calgarians that are relevant and useful to improving their lives. Engagement is a key factor in achieving lasting personal change and growth.Motivate: Its CUPS role to provide tools and supports for people who are engaged. Whether they are seeking to overcome generational patterns, lifestyle based traumas or health issues, we are responsible for helping people change when they are ready.Achieve: Success is helping people move forward, so they can become part of a healthy community, be independent and contribute to society.REPORT to the COMMUNITY: 2015-2016The year ending March 2016 has been a challenging year for all Calgarians and we have certainly seen the evidence of this at our doors. We saw 1,000 more individuals (9,300 in total) when compared to the previous year.Evidence supports prevention as being more cost effective and better serving for long-term change. The Alberta Family Wellness Initiative and the Center on the Developing Child at Harvard University are guiding much of our work, providing clear and current scientific evidence that is applied to our programs.The focus on prevention has certainly produced more long-term outcomes and a greater impact for our participants, enabling us to be involved in international initiatives such as Change in Mind and Ready4 Routines.Partnerships are a critical part of how we work and we could not be successful without them. We are Alberta Strong and extremely appreciative of our colleagues, volunteers, donors and ambassadors for helping us create such a collaborative Calgary community.9,364 Participants Served; 166 Staff, 480 Volunteers, 50+ Partners and 3,500 Donors703 households: 110 Key Case Management, 390 Community Development, 203 Graduated Rent Subsidy----CUPS HISTORY: Since 1989, CUPS has been helping people overcome the challenges of poverty and attain brighter futures. Heres how we began:1980s | Several downtown churches meet to develop an ecumenical project to provide referral services and basic medical care to those arriving at their doors in search of help.1989-1994 | The Canadian Bible Society building on 7th Avenue SW was leased to house the Calgary Urban Project Society and CUPS is offically founded. Referral services and health care were provided entirely by volunteers, including Christian doctors and doctors from the University of Calgary. CUPS purchases a former bar on 7th Avenue that will provide a convenient location for the population served.1996-1997 | CUPS launches its Community Outreach program with support from the City of Calgary. The CUPS Family Centre is created to help the increasing number of low-income families who were requesting CUPS services. Calgary Street Talk is born. This monthly newspaper tells the story of poverty in Calgary and the world. The CUPS Family Centre is created to help the increasing number of low-income families who were requesting CUPS services. Calgary Street Talk is born. This monthly newspaper tells the story of poverty in Calgary and the world.2002-2010 | To address the root causes of poverty, CUPS continues to expand its range of services and converts another former bar on 11th Avenue into the One World Child Development Centre. CUPS launches the Rapid Exit program to provide affordable housing during Calgarys economic boom. CUPS discontinues Calgary Street Talk. The success of the CUPS One World Child Development Centre leads to the launch of its Social Emotional Early Development (SEED) program.2012 | CUPS main site relocates to 1001 10 Ave SW. The new space is three times larger than CUPS previous building and two thirds of the building is used for CUPS programs. This allows for a 30% increase in programs and services, including the addition of the Pre-Natal to Three Child Development Centre (based on CUPS SEED program) for at-risk families expecting children or with children up to 35 months. CUPS housing program, Rapid Exit, is able to leave its satellite office and becomes three separate housing programs: Key Case Management, Graduated Rent Subsidy and Community Development.","To increase our impact, weve aligned our strength areas to meet the unique needs of Calgarys marginalized and have identified three areas where success was most critical to those we serve: Health, Education, and Housing.Health: There is an undeniable link between poverty and poor health. For those living in poverty, factors such as trauma, homelessness, lack of food security and low health literacy levels compound and contribute to health issues. With nearly 25 years of experience, CUPS health services go beyond basic care to help Calgarys most vulnerable individuals and families overcome the barriers to their well-being.Last year, CUPS provided health care for 5,183 patients, including pre-natal care for 214 women, pediatric care for 659 children and mental health care for 530 adults.Primary Care ClinicWomens Health ClinicPediatric clinicMental health carePre and post-natal careHepatitis C diagnosis and treatmentDiabetes careDental clinicOptometry clinicFoot clinicVisiting specialistsHospital discharge coordinationOutreach health and medical care to 6 Calgary shelters including The Calgary Drop In Centre, The Mustard Seed, Calgary Womens Emergency Shelter, Brendas House, Alpha House and Awo Taan Healing Lodge.Education: Our education programs seek to improve the lives and futures of children and adults by disrupting the intergenerational cycle of poverty. To accomplish this, CUPS offers research-based early intervention and support programs that focus not only on the social, emotional and cognitive development of children, but also on the overall well-being of parents, families and adults.Last year, 87 students enrolled in CUPS Child Development Centres; 431 parents attended parenting programs, 628 families in crisis were supported; and 69 adults received the Lorraine Melchior Bursary Fund.Family Development CentreOne World Child Development Centre (3-6 year olds)Pre-Natal to Three Child Development CentreNurturing Parenting ProgramMultiple parenting programsLorraine Melchior Bursary FundSocial opportunities for familiesCrisis supportHousing and Supports:Stable housing continues to be the major factor in overcoming poverty and is essential for good health, child development and personal well-being. A safe living environment helps build social connections and dramatically increases education and employment prospects. We not only help Calgarys most vulnerable adults and children secure housing, we provide the support they need to maintain it.Since 2008, CUPS has housed over 3,600 homeless adults and children. Last, CUPS Housing and Supports prevented homelessness for 323 households, provided 923 pieces of government ID, completed 250 tax returns and provided almost 800 referrals for food, furniture, clothing, mattresses and Alberta Works Emergency Funding.Key Case Management housing programCommunity Development housing programGraduated Rent Subsidy housing programClient in Transition emergency fundingID programIncome Tax HelpReferrals to Food Bank, Sleep Country, Neighbour Link, WINS","Your support is critical to helping individuals and families in our city move out of poverty to independence and self-realization.

"85",676,"Calgary Wildlife Rehabilitation Society","What if you were hit by a car and nobody stopped to help you?Countless wild animals are injured every day by their intersection with human activity; caught in barbed wire, electrocuted on power lines, attacked by pets, caught in cruel traps, shot and hit by cars with no-one to help them recover or end their suffering. We care. We believe that every life has value and provide a second chance for these animals to live the wild life they were meant to.-----Our History: The Calgary Wildlife Rehabilitation Society (CWRS) was founded in February 1993 to address the growing need for a wildlife rehabilitation facility in Calgary. The CWRS is the result of many organizations and individuals working together to achieve common goals.The Calgary Zoo was accepting and treating wildlife brought in by the general public. When the number of wildlife in need of medical attention began increasing significantly every year, the need for a wildlife rehabilitation facility became apparent. Also several local veterinary clinics were interested in donating time to treating wildlife, but a long-term recovery facility was still required. The result was the creations of CWRS in Febuary 1993.At present, the CWRS is working to expand its facilities in order to accommodate more wildlife and enhance its efforts to rescue and rehabilitate them.","Calgary Wildlife Rehabilitation Society (CWRS) was established in 1993 to provide professional care for wildlife rehabilitation. Our goal is to Rescue, Rehabilitate and Release --the three Rs of responsible wildlife management. Each year we receive over 2,000 injured or orphaned wild animals and respond to thousands of wildlife-related calls from the public. In addition, CWRS provides motivational, skill-building experiences for volunteers and valuable outreach and education services to the community. CWRS is a registered charity and does not receive any direct government funding. CWRS is the only veterinary based wildlife hospital within the City of Calgary. If you would like to help our community, click here: volunteering with CWRS.Thank-you toTrending on Shawfor having our great horned owl, Ophelia, on their show to be an ambassador for CWRS and the amazing work that happens here very day. CWRS is featured on SHAW TV and the video link is here:Ophelia, our ambassador.","CWRS Goals  Objectives1. To rescue and provide appropriate veterinary based care and treatment to injured and orphaned wildlife with the goal of releasing vigorous individuals capable of successfully returning to their natural habitat. The Calgary Wildlife Rehabilitation Society rescues injured and orphaned wildlife in Calgary and the surrounding area. Animals are either rescued by our team of volunteers, are brought to us by the public, come through Calgary 311 services, or are filtered through local veterinary clinics. Once onsite, the animals are medically examined by our trained wildlife technicians (RAHT or B. Sc), overseen by our staff veterinarian, and an appropriate course of treatment is implemented. Animals are kept at our facility until they are deemed medically fit by our staff veterinarian to be released back into the wild. An appropriate locale is carefully selected by the staff and all healthy individuals are released back into their natural habitat. Migratory animals are kept until the appropriate time of year. Animals unable to be released due to the severity of injuries sustained are euthanized or kept as education ambassadors.The Calgary Wildlife Rehabilitation Society works closely with Sustainable Resource Development to ensure that all animals are being taken care of appropriately. We are an accredited organization (Alberta Veterinary Medical Association) and do not charge for our services.2. To provide relevant public education and outreach to schools and other community groups through presentations, visits, displays and literature. The Calgary Wildlife Rehabilitation Society provides education programs to the public, including schools, seniors residences, libraries, fairs, festivals, The Childrens Hospital, Ronald McDonalds House and other appropriate venues. The Education program serves to inform the public about our services, address conservation issues and provide information about native wildlife. Our educators volunteer their time, donating thousands of hours a year to the hundreds of programs that we book. When appropriate, an education ambassador is sent as part of the education program. We currently have 3 education ambassadors: Lito (Swainsons Hawk), Oberon (Great Horned Owl) and Ophelia (Great Horned Owl). Each of these animals was brought to the center injured and due to the severity of the injury could not be successfully released back into the wild.3. To maintain connections with other local organizations whose primary interest is wildlife, environmental conservation and related public education The Calgary Wildlife Rehabilitation Society maintains working relationships with the Cochrane Ecological Society, Medicine River Wildlife Center, the Alberta Wilderness Association and other similar organizations. We actively maintain communication with such organizations and will transport animals to their facilities under the direction of Sustainable Resource Development when it is in the best interest of our wildlife patients.CWRS has been asked to give talks about wildlife and conservation at the Marda Loop Justice Film Festival and for Nature Calgary. CWRS is invited every year to host a booth at Bow Habitat Station, a local fish hatchery and nature interpretive center. These are just a few examples of other local organizations with which CWRS maintains a positive and collaborative partnership.4. To provide volunteer opportunities and service to the community by making available a venue for members, service groups, and volunteer minimum-security inmates to contribute to a community service while acquiring new skills. The Calgary Wildlife Rehabilitation Society has a roster of over 200 active volunteers who contribute to the functioning of our society. These volunteers are members of our society. Volunteers help with animal care (cleaning cages and feeding animals), pickups/rescues (picking up animals at veterinary clinics or rescuing animals that are injured), education (running education programs in schools, seniors residences and other public relations events) and as board members.Minimum Security inmates volunteer their time, under supervision, to help with site maintenance.Service groups volunteer their time to help with construction projects.","We receive no direct governement funding and must rely on donations to raise the money required for food, housing, medical supplies and our staff of six. Every donation received has a direct and meaningful impact on the care we can give our wildlife patients.CWRS needs to raise $250,000 this year to keep our doors open (our fiscal year aligns with the calendar year).

"86",533,"Calgary Women's Emergency Shelter","Sally phoned into the helpline looking for emergency support and safety. She was phoning from a rural, isolated area just outside of the city. Our 24-Hour Family Violence Helpline counselor encouraged her to take deep breaths and found out some key pieces of information so we could act quickly. Sally spoke of her husband of 10 years constantly calling her names, tracking her movements within their town and recently becoming physically aggressive with her in front of their children. She commented on her husbands love of hunting and his recent concerns she was cheating on him.She had her children hidden under a blanket in the backseat with their family dog, bags in the trunk she had packed months before and all their legal documents hidden in her pant leg from that morning. The helpline counselor asked Sally where she was and then connected with the local police to ensure she and her children were able to leave their family farm with the protection the situation required. Police were on their way to formally escort the family to safety.A formal assessment around the extent of the abuse and safety precautions Sally had taken over the years brought forward her resistance to violence and ability to protect her family in the most desperate of times. Next the counselor was able to connect with the local pet care program so the familys dog would be well cared for during this time of crisis. Knowing the family pet was not going to be left behind and in danger while the family fled was crucial to ensuring the familys needs were met in a time of crisis....all family members are safe.With assistance and emotional support from the Calgary Womens Emergency Shelter Helpline counsellor, a police escort, and her immediate needs and concerns met, Sally was able to successfully escape the violence at home and bring her children to safety.","The Calgary Womens Emergency Shelter is focused on ending family violence and abuse in the lives of women, children, youth and men.

"87",216,"Calgary Youth Justice Society","Amy was described as challenging authority and having a bad attitude. She was seen as cocky, opinionated, angry and defiant. Amy was taking some classes at an outreach high school, but life circumstances and choices were weighing heavily on her; she was struggling. Drugs and alcohol were a problem and she was partying a lot, she had behavioral challenges and was was skipping out on school, she had unhealthy relationships and an unplanned pregnancy.Her mom was at a loss, saying that Amy had no hope, no direction, and was generally very unhappy. She was worried. Then a glimpse of hope appeared on what she calls the day that everything changed. Amy came home from school in a good mood (emphasizing that good moods were not common for her). She was excited to say that she was nominated for a leadership program because a teacher at school thought she was a leader with a potential.Imagine, as a mom, how she must have felt that day  Amy wasntt referred to a program because someone saw another problem that needed to be fixed; this time it was a special spark in her daughter that earned her a spot in an innovative program called In the Lead.It took a while for things to shift for Amy. But slowly, with a relentless focus on her strengths, she began to believe them and use them in new and promising ways. She was developing leadership characteristics in weekly classes where the facilitator led engaging conversations with her peers, she was connected with a Volunteer Coach who helped to mentor Amy through her journey, and she was giving back to the community through group volunteer events.She became outspoken, using her voice to stand up for herself and others. She was independent, strong-willed, and engaged. She had focus and ambition. Her mom says it best  when Amy was in the program she became more positive, more confident and more at ease. She was happy, she had hopeher light was back, I could see it in her eyes. She is now on a journey to becoming the person she was meant to be.This is only one story of one youth in one program at Calgary Youth Justice Society, but the great news is that Amy is among 400 youth every year who are given a chance to change, and do. Even still, there are too many overlooked young people in our community, like Amy, who are waiting for someone to notice whats strong instead of whats wrong.Remember those characteristics that Amy used to be known for cocky, opinionated, angry and defiant? Here are Amys own words she uses to describe who she is now:I am courageous. I am smart. I am outspoken. I am beautiful. I am a leader.. I am me.","Calgary Youth Justice Society has been making a difference in the lives of young people whose life circumstances and choices have placed them at risk. Since the early beginnings of establishing Youth Justice Committees 18 years ago, we have continued to be innovative in our approach. CYJS has always seen the potential for young people to be resilient if engaged in ways that affirm their value and worth as the starting point for positive change. When adult volunteers and community partners connect in a positive way with young people who are at risk of or have involvement with the criminal justice system, the impact is youth who feel supported to be a part of our community in a meaningful way.Our vision is a city where young people both contribute to, and flourish in, safe, caring communities.Our accomplishments - as of the end of 2014224 Youth supported by Youth Justice Committees in 201411,000+ Youth served in the last 17 years17 Youth Justice Committees in Calgary210+ Calgary Communities served150 Youth Justice Committee volunteers125 Volunteers have served more than 3 years4,314 Volunteer hours contributed in 2014","Calgary Youth Justice Society, together with our volunteers, community partnerships and investors, serves young people through the delivery of 3 programs: Youth Justice Committees, Ngage, and In the Lead.YOUTH JUSTICE COMMITTEES:First-time offenders represent the largest population of young people coming into contact with our criminal justice system. Youth Justice Committees provide a community based volunteer driven alternative to court for young people charged with minor offences. Over twenty Youth Justice Committees serve over 180 communities in Calgary, and through the efforts of over 200 volunteers, give hundreds of young people a second chance. The program is tailor-made to each youth, has a high level of collaboration with the justice system and community partners, and retains long-serving volunteers who deliver a professional service.Youth often say they now realize their own power and the opportunity to make a positive choice, they have a new idea of their role and responsibilities in a community, and they feel better about themselves as a result of the sanctions they were given. Sanctions are often chosen to fit the strengths, future plans, interests and current challenges of the young person before them. When assigned community service work, young people get job experience, e.g. volunteering at the library, and increased feelings of self-worth, satisfaction and sense of belonging to community.NGAGE:Ngage is for young peoplein conflict with the law who are having trouble starting or completing their mandated community service hours. It provides wrap around support to youthwho have significantbarrierswhich would prevent them from achieving success in a typical volunteer placement.Traditionally community service hours have been used in a more punitive fashion. However, we have found that when a young person is engaged with giving back to the community by tapping into theirspark, they feel a greater sense of connection to the community and will often continue to volunteer beyond their sanctioned hours, sometimes even bringing friends and family to volunteer as well.Partnerships are created specifically for each youth with non-profit organizations and local community groups who are educated on strength-based approach mentoring to ensure youth successfully complete community service hours.IN THE LEAD: Not all young people with strong leadership abilities are easy to spot. Many young people,facing challenges and obstacles growing up, develop characteristics that can be the foundation of great leadership but are too oftenoverlooked in favour of peers who are displaying their potential in more conventional and obvious ways.Over 16 weeks, Young Leaders recognize, nurture and practice individual strengths and character competencies that are known to build resilience. Cenovus Energyengages their employees as Volunteer Coaches to connect one on one with the young leaders, providing valuable encouragement and support.Together, the Young Leader and Coach lay the foundationfor realizing the young persons potential, and reducing the likelihood of risk-taking behaviour and minimizing the challenges of negative life circumstances.","One way to predict the future is to create it.

"88",643,"Calgary Youth Science Fair Society","Where would our world be without Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM)?There would be no Internet or iPhone. Online purchasing or e-Learning wouldnt exist. Developing vaccines for viruses such as Ebola or Zika would be nearly impossible. The face of our world, and our daily lives, would be considerably different today.The Calgary Youth Science Fair (CYSF) inspires youth to discover their potential in these STEM fields, attracting bright hardworking students to grow their great ideas into initiatives they can take into the larger world.Discovery starts with the grain of an idea driven by curiosity that when pursued evolves into solving real issues that have meaningful impacts on the world around us.Its essential that we nurture and encourage these ideas, no matter how big or small.Because they will very likely one day touch our lives in a very significant way.Aspiring young scientists, engineers and problem solvers become engaged STEM leaders through encouragement and opportunity. Dr. Breanne Everett, CYSF Alum 1997-2002I really owe where I am today to the experience I gained with participating in the science fair, says Dr. Breanne Everett who entered science projects ranging from exploring a butterflys attraction to color through to researching breast cancer indicators. The CYSF has absolutely impacted my career and really gave me an appreciation for science, the scientific method, and the desire to explore new ideas and concepts.Dr. Everett is now the founder and CEO of Orpyx Medical Technologies, a company that helps those with diabetic nerve damage track their foot health more effectively to prevent foot ulcers.Kelcie Miller-Anderson, CYSF Alum 2005-2012CYSF gave me an opportunity to explore my passion for science and taught me about the importance of innovation, says Kelcie Miller-Anderson who at the age of 15 began developing an in-situ method to treat tailings water in the oil industry using oyster mushrooms. Her idea stemmed from her natural curiosity when seeing a single dandelion growing up through pavement as she wondered how it could be there.I just founded my first company, MycoRemedy, that is based on my research from my 10th and 12th grade science fair projects. Weve already secured our first round of investment and are projected to be remediating our first sites in 2016. Its crazy to think that it all started with a high school science fair project!","Every April (since 1962!), we bring together the vivid imaginations of nearly 1,000 students in Grades 5-12 to showcase their ingenuity by participating in the science fair and wondering how things work.  Asking why, thinking - what if it was better?And then applying the scientific method to dig for answers. In collaboration with Calgary and area schools, we provide a fun science fair experience where students:Interact with their peersExplore their interestsGrow their knowledgeAcquire real life skills such as critical thinking and creative problem solvingAre acknowledgedfor thinking, differentlyGain greater insights into the world of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math thats all around themThrough the discovery process, students deepen their realization that they have the ability to make real contributions to improve our world in areas such as:Detoxifying our environment using an innovative sand filterGaining insights into how human cells function to help improve our healthReducing micro plastics in our waterwaysExploring safer travel with a wheel that adapts to changing terrainThe knowledge, friends, mentors and discoveries made along the way become lifelong experiences theyll always remember and carry with them throughout their careers.2016 Annual Report Highlights:We hosted over 900 students representing over 700 projects with 550 volunteer judges. With 54 years of history, we host one of the largest science fairs in Canada.With Calgarys economic uncertainty, we worked above and beyond to meet our benchmark of an exceptional science experience for our students. The Fair remained a high quality, enriching, and overall excellent experience for students, volunteers, and donors.Canada Wide Science Fair 2016 was held in Montreal this year, and twelve finalists from our Fair participated. Team Calgary brought home 4 gold medals, 4 silver medals, 3 bronze medals, 24 scholarships and 6 awards (incl.

At the age of 16, Hayley wondered if she could find a way to accelerate the detoxification of the tailings ponds in Alberta. So she spent two years designing and testing the effectiveness of sand filters on the biodegradation of toxic naphthenic acids such as those found in the oilsands.Application of these inexpensive and sustainable bioreactors could significantly accelerate the detoxification of Canadas oilsands, explained Hayley Todesco. Conventional bioreactors would take over 200 years to cleanse the tailings from the naphthenic acids. With her new system using sand filters and a biofilm, it could biodegrade them significantly faster taking only 19 years rather than centuries.Hayley is currently refining her designs and pursuing pilot project opportunities in the oil industry.Hayley also reached international recognition with her 2014 CYSF science fair project by winning the senior age category and a $25,000 scholarship at the 2014 Google Science Fair beating out her competitors from around the world.As of September 2016, Hayley is now in her third year studying microbiology at the University of Alberta.Hayley Todesco - CYSF Alum 2007-2014There are many ways you can be part of CYSFs legacy!The CYSF is made possible every year through people, companies and organizations like you.

"89",670,"Calgary Zoological Society","Connecting with nature is essential for protecting wildlife. The Calgary Zoo is that connection. We have endless stories to share about our animals who act as ambassadors for their species, our people and our conservation work.Residents of the Wechiau Hippo Sanctuary Share Their Stories:  It was a simple concept  create a sanctuary to save hippos  and over a decade ago, the Wechiau Community Hippo Sanctuary was founded to do just that. Nestled along the banks of the Upper Black Volta River in the northwest corner of Ghana, on the border with Burkina Faso, the sanctuary protects one of only two remaining hippo wallows in the entire country.Living with Africas most dangerous animals in your backyard wasnt easy. The hippos watery home was also a primary source of drinking water, and crops planted close to the river for easy irrigation were often eaten by hungry hippos at night. Conflicts between people and hippos were inevitable  something had to change.In 1998, the chiefs and elders of 17 communities came together and embraced a new model of conservation that would protect the hippos and help their people. With help from the Calgary Zoo, two distinct zones were created along a 40-kilometre stretch of the river  one zone for humans and one for hippos. Boreholes were dug to provide fresh drinking water at seven sites throughout the sanctuary. Finally, hippos and people could peacefully co-exist.---The Calgary Zoo is more than just a place to see animals. Whether we are inspiring our visitors to love nature, saving species in western Canada from extinction or working with scientists on the other side of the globe, our ultimate goal is simple: to help wildlife and keep it wild. The successful care of endangered species in captivity and in the wild is not easy, but there is no alternative. Through education and exposure, we help our visitors understand and care about the natural world around us. We are proud to provide a place where visitors can learn about protecting the world around them while creating action and developing future conservationists.","Its easy to get Calgary Zoo visitors excited about nature  you cant help but feel a connection with the amazing creatures that call the zoo home. We celebrate the magical moments that happen here to open peoples hearts and minds, and help them take the next step  from recycling their cell phone to supporting conservation organizations.We are passionate about conservation. And we know that it takes good science to successfully protect endangered species. Our dedicated biologists have supported and provided technical assistance to conservation projects in more than 20 countries. The zoo specializes in community-based conservation initiatives, one of which (Wechiau Community Hippo Sanctuary in Ghana, West Africa) received the UNs Equatorial Prize. Through the Husky Energy Endangered Species Program, we are recognized as a North American leader in the science of species reintroduction. Our team may come from diverse backgrounds, but have one thing in common  a passion for conserving our worlds biodiversity.In Our Backyard:We are sharing our messages of hope and inspiration through our on-park experiences with our guests and encouraging them to make a difference in the world around them. Working with governments, non-profit organizations, specialists, industry and communities, our team of conservation biologists conduct groundbreaking scientific research. Some of the species we are studying include whooping cranes, swift foxes, northern leopard frog and black-tailed prairie dogs.Across the World:When committed communities get the support they need, the conservation results are truly inspiring. But communities in developing parts of the world must have a reason  largely economic  to protect wildlife. So westart by alleviating poverty: creating employment opportunities, focusing on education and improving the overall quality of life for community members. When people prosper, nature benefits.We choose projects that apply sound science, include local communities and have the greatest conservation impact. Then, we determine the best way we can help.2015 Highlights from the President and CEO:To strengthen the appeal of the zoo, we introduced two new spectacular events, Dinosaurs Alive and ILLUMINASIALantern and Garden Festival. These provided our guests with an escape to a different world; a journey back in time when dinosaurs roamed the earth and an enchanting evening into the beauty and history of Chinese lantern making.Our 1.3 million visitors, our second best attendance in the zoos history, were treated to new and innovative experiences. We transformed some of our popular habitats to offer the next generation of conservationists newways to interact with our animals such as the new slide at the wolf habitat and the new viewing windows at theJapanese macaques.Thanks to everyones hard work, the zoo ended 2015 in a positive financial position. As of December 31, 2015 we have put aside $3.5 million for future meaningful conservation activities in Canada and around the world, helping sustain wild animals and wild places.2015 Donor Report:Over the past year, donors like you have made it possible to:...employ women from 17communities by opening a newshea butter processing factory atthe Wechiau Community HippoSanctuary in Ghana, West Africa....conduct the 20th year ofswift fox counting.

That number might sound low, but its actually quite impressive. With help from the Calgary Zoo, whooping cranes have recovered from an all-time low of only 21 birds in the 1940s.We are one of three major facilities  and Canadas only one - that breeds whooping cranes to increase the wild population. The birds that are hatched and reared in captivity are either released to the wild to bolster new populations or held back to supplement the breeding program.The intricacies of going from whooping crane egg to migrating bird often seem endless and the road to reintroduction is complex. Projects like this depend on sound science to improve inseminating, incubating, hatching and monitoring of whooping cranes.Each spring, about a week before the Calgary Zoos whooping crane eggs hatch, they are whisked off by plane to one of two breeding facilities that we work with to save these magnificent birds. A zookeeper accompanies the precious cargo  anywhere from one egg up to as many as six  carrying them in a custom-made duffel bag equipped with its own incubator.Under carefully controlled conditions, eggs are incubated, hatched and watched by attendants who wear white crane costumes to ensure that the fledglings do not imprint on humans. Once the chicks are capable of flight, they are either taught to migrate from Wisconsin, or some are released into a non-migratory flock.We are like proud parents each time one of our birds is released back to Mother Nature, but we know that the population is still fragile. Our Calgary Zoo biologists are dedicated to the recovery of whooping cranes to ensure that this proud and mighty bird flies annually through the Alberta and Saskatchewan skies.Animal CareProviding world-class care to our animals involves the creation of natural habitat exhibits, engaging enrichment, knowledgeable zookeepers and an exceptional veterinary team. The Calgary Zoo is home to the best zoo and wildlife hospital in western Canada. In addition to caring for animals that are sick or injured, our dedicated veterinarian team provides preventative care for healthy animals, studies diseases, conducts conservation research and trains the next generation of zoo vets.The Calgary Zoo participates in 26 Species Survival Plans and 49 Population Management Plans with the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) for species at risk or threatened with extinction. These programs protect the long-term genetics of the captive species creating sustainable insurance populations of animals.Community Based ConservationSaving species, protecting habitat and promoting sustainable living are worldwide challenges that require a global effort. The Calgary Zoo works around the world with an international network of colleagues to ensure maximum conservation impact, the application of sound science and the inclusion of local communities. In addition to scientific research, the zoo helps develop capacity in local communities to manage their own natural ecosystems in a way that both conserves wildlife and benefits local people.The zoos newest community-based conservation project is working with lemurs. Were setting oursights on the tree canopies of Madagascar, the only place in the world where lemurs are found in nature.Building on our success protecting eight endangered species across western Canada and our award winning work safeguarding hippos in Ghana,were now expanding our efforts to help one of the worlds most endangered primates.Our conservation model enableslocal communities to manage their own ecosystem in a way that both protects wildlife and benefits local people.Educating the next generation of conservationistsThe Calgary Zoo connects people of all ages with nature through engaging educational programming. Understanding the natural world is a vital key to inspiring actions that promote conservation. By connectingover 1.2 million visitors of all ageswith nature and sharing the conservation stories of our planets most endangered species, the Calgary Zoo teaches about the challenges of our world today and how we can take action to create a brighter tomorrow.Zoo education takes many forms, from formal classroom programs to hands-on exploration. Approximately 65,000 school children take part in formal zoo education programs and field trips every year - an incredible opportunity to engage the next generation. The zoo offers curriculum-based school programs for kindergarten to grade 12, generating excitement about nature and inspiring students to be conservation stewards.Education builds a legacy for future generations  a love of nature and a commitment to conservation.","As you can tell by the picture above, Riley really loves lemurs!

"90",382,"Canadian Centre for Male Survivors of Child Sexual Abuse (cc4ms)","1 in 6 men - or more - has been a victim of childhood sexual abuse before the age of 18. For women, its 1 in 3 before the age of 18. There are 323 assault centres in Canada, primarily for women and children.For men? There are four (4) dedicated treatment centres - Victoria, Vancouver, Ottawa and Montreal  therefore, none on the prairies nor in the northern territories. These four centres provide excellent service but are unable to fulfill the demand. Most survivors, therefore, are left to dull their pain and shame through addictions - substance abuse, gambling, sex, violence and work. Many men simply try to forget the rape because they are told in many ways to get over it.Survivors of this childhood trauma also have to cope with the devastating effects of betrayal because, in94% of thecases, it was someone the children knew and trusted who raped and traumatized them. As a result, most survivors dont disclose the crime for 20 years during which time the pain leads to depression, anger, anxiety, sleeplessness, homelessness and often, suicide.Before healing can start, disclosure must happen. Before disclosure can happen, a survivor must realize that healing is possible and that he can access it. He needs to know that there are people, including professionals, who are eager and able to help him recover.","Since the spring of 2012, cc4ms has operated as a referral agency. This is accomplished by responding to male survivors who contacted us (generally through emails from our website) wanting to know where to go for treatment and connecting them with our specially selected therapists.          cc4ms therapists are independent professionals (registered psychologists and social workers) who have had experience in this area and wish to improve their treatment skills. As well, they have agreed to help us build a world-class dedicated treatment centre here in Calgary. In May 2015, we organized our first annual Bringing Healing! Treatment Training Seminar which 20 therapists attended. Sessions were led by two of the founders who have created three of the four dedicated treatment centres. Currently, we are working with nine therapists (six females/three males) and recruiting even more. We also intend to establish standards and qualification for therapists working in this area.As well, we have partnered with twelve well-respected community organizations such as Southern Alberta HIV Clinic, AIDS Calgary, Simon House, Fresh START, 1835, John Howard Society, Jewish Family Services, of Calgary, the Distress Centre, Calgary Police Service as well as the Wellness Centres of our three post-secondary institutions. These partners are experts in their fields but trust cc4ms to help their survivors.Evidence-based holistic programs are being developed and clients are evaluated both before and during treatment to ensure they are receiving appropriate and effective therapy.------Protocols and outcomes are determined by our Clinical Care Coordinator in conjunction with our Treatment Advisory Council (TAC) composed of multidisciplinary practitioners familiar with childhood sexual assault, therapy and trauma informed practices as they pertain to men. These protocols are male-centric. Our Clinical Care Coordinator is responsible for liaising with survivors and our partner agencies.Incidentally, cc4ms covers the cost of therapy sessions if necessary and usually it is necessary to do so.We focus on the issue so as to smash the silence overcome the stigma which has long discouraged survivors from speaking out and/or seeking help. By making survivors and others aware of treatment, more will seek help; thus, a safer and more productive community.Mission Statement: Our mission is to improve the lives of adult male survivors of child sexual abuse through treatment, public education, research and advocacy.Vision Statement: Our vision is to be the leading treatment center in Canada helping male survivors of childhood sexual abuse.Objectives:To promote good health through counseling and support programs, including financial support.To advance the education of the public and professionals working with AMS of CSA about the prevention of, and responses to, child sexual abuse by offering information, resources, seminars, conferences, concerts and through our website which is updated frequently.To initiate, collect and disseminate research on AMS of CSA.Our program centers around the model we call H-E-A-R! - Healing, Education, Advocacy  Research.Healing: Healing is definitely possible for most survivors and should be achieved with trained professionals. Furthermore, we recognize that healing takes different paths and lengths of time so we are client sensitive.Education: Bringing awareness of this situation, that 1 in 6 of Canadian men under the age of 18 has been sexually abused, is an important step towards healing and greater understanding leading to support.Advocacy: Generally, male survivors have been left to advocate for themselves. We will work with other groups in this field so that survivors have a strong, clear voice. As well, we will advocate that offenders are more appropriately handled in the light of this very serious crime and the lack of rehabilitation prospects.Research: Very little research has been produced in Canada concerning AMS of CSA - or indeed, child sexual abuse. We will work with academic institutions and governments to distribute the latest research and encourage further studies.By addressing these four issues, cc4ms will aid in the prevention of crime and tragedy of childhood sexual abuse while helping adult male survivors to heal and thrive.","By partnering with addiction agencies, wellness centres at post-secondary institutions, mental health organizations and social agencies, cc4ms provides their clients with treatment. Through increased awareness in emergency rooms and locker rooms, in doctors offices and corporate offices, in churches and unions and elsewhere through a public awareness campaign, individual survivors and others will be made aware that healing is possible. Much of this marketing initiative has been made available by the generosity of the Calgary Foundation for which survivors, their family and friends and cc4ms are very grateful.All survivors communicate with our Clinical Care Coordinator who chooses the best therapist for them based on a number of criteria  male or female therapist; location in the city; type of therapy, etc.Survivors receive counseling, both on an individual and group basis  10 individual sessions and then 20 group sessions with frequent reviews to determine progress using a variety of established tests. Adjustments to this protocol are possible as determined by our Clinical Care Coordinator and the relevant therapist. Our Clinical Care Coordinator is also responsible for liaising with the therapists, monitoring their performance and organizing the annual Bringing Healing! Treatment Training Seminars.By establishing partnerships with academic institutions and governments, we will enhance the access to evidence-based information, strategies and solutions and generate new knowledge for dissemination. Additionally, we will provide students studying medicine, social work and psychology with information and encouragement to pursue studies and careers in this area. Members of the TAC plus our Clinical Care Coordinator and CEO lead this initiative.By partnering with foundations, corporations, individuals and governments concerned about health and specifically mental health we will spread the message, coordinate efforts and access funds to alleviate the suffering and damage to families and the economy.One of our public outreach programs, Magnificent Men!

"93",562,"Canadian Mental Health Association - Calgary Region","The reality for many people dealing with mental health challenges, is that they have adopted a mask  one that camouflages the threads of shame, misunderstanding, and sometimes loneliness.But in Calgary that is changing, thanks to the Peer Options programs at CMHA. Here, the peer movement has moved into plain sight for everyone to see!With the various Peer Options programs to choose from, each curriculum provides individuals a concrete understanding of building healthy relationships and creates a safe place to share with fellow peers their lived experience who are now focused on wellness and recovery just like them.There are four different streams for Peer Options including, Art of Friendship, Community Art of Friendship, Community Circle of Friends and Welcome Wednesdays. In each program, peers have the opportunity to set personal recovery goals, connect with the community, build self-awareness and apply effective recovery tools to live their best quality of life.Many graduates of the Peer Options programs give back through peer leadership offering inspiration, understanding, mentorship and hope.This especially rings true for two peer advocates at the CMHA Calgary office  both graduates of Peer Options now supporting others who are reaching out for help.Catherine MacAllister, is a 21 year old peer in the Calgary main office, who moved from Ireland as a teen. She recalls suffering from anorexia and using other unhealthy coping mechanisms to silence her demons of demeaning self-talk and feelings of isolation and loneliness. Just seconds from the gym doorsteps, she received an alarming phone call from her doctor that she must retreat immediately from any workouts, as her heart beat was too low. That was the turning point for Catherine. It was either get help or be consumed entirely by my thoughts, and for my own sake and sanity I reached out she says about her decision to make the positive changes she required to begin her road to recovery.With similar heritage of English and Welsh descent, Donna Shukys too is a peer advocate at CMHA Calgary. After graduating as a peer support specialist, Donna volunteered with the Community Education team at the CMHA where she was introduced to the peer options program. I had gone through a lot of change in my life and it was too much for me to process and move through. My anxiety levels ran high and my depression was hard to manage. Once an overachiever, it all became a blur she explains.Both Catherine and Donna maintain that there is a fine line between feeling supported and feeling pitied after breaking the silence of suffering from mental health concerns.While some members of the community applaud and connect on a different level because of the honesty, others turn a blind eye and begin to treat you differently  its as though theres an us and a them Catherine says.For those who knew me, my journey and supported me, nothing changed. I was perceived as brave by some and others were concerned that by supporting an issue that carries so much stigma, I would open myself up to being harshly judged. In many cases this did happen, but I didnt take it personally because although it involved me, it wasnt about me. Donna realized.Just knowing that youre not alone and that options do exist, creates an instant connection Catherine added. The more we openly talk about it, the more it normalizes a topic that should be normal in the first place.When we are not well, we can hurt others without realizing Donna explains. I believe as we progress through our journeys, we learn more things about ourselves. Recovery is possible! I am living proof of this.When asked separately to describe their experience with Peer Options; hope, community and empowerment are the attributes both Catherine and Donna used almost unwaveringly.I wanted to start living not just surviving Catherine expressed. After the curtains close and the charade is over, the only masks being worn are by those who dont understand what mental health really is. We all have it, and its time we all start talking about it!","30,599 total individuals served through all CMHA - Calgary programs/services. That was CMHAs social impact on our city last year.2016 was a productive year at CMHA Calgary. Despite the challenges in our city which directly impacted us, we saw more clients and connected with more Calgarians than ever before. And we were able to do this by being adaptive, resilient and changing how we work.We have often referred to 2016 as The Year of the Peer at CMHA Calgary. Peers, those with lived experience, have a special role in supporting others along the mental health journey. Their support is based on an implicit understanding of having experienced this journey. We are very proud of the fact that with the financial help of Calgary Foundation, Bell Lets Talk, Calgary Herald, City of Calgary, FCSS, First Energy and the Government of Alberta we have built a Peer School. Twenty peers have completed training and many are now part of our day-to-day supports as people reach out to CMHA in record numbers. Imagine meeting a friendly face and hearing a supportive voice coupled with a helping hand when you or a loved one is facing a mental health challenge.Beyond strengthening our agency by adopting a recovery focused model of care, we have managed to make other significant inroads which have benefited the community.We have spent a large part of the year adapting to funder requirements and community need by re-evaluating every part of our agency.

"95",500,"Canadian National Institute for the Blind (CNIB) ","Independence is a word often taken for granted, butfor those of us who are living with vision loss, independence is everything we strive for.Up until the age of 28, I had lived a relatively normal life. I worked for a marketing company and had my ambitions and career ahead of me. Unexpectedly, I began experiencing issues with my vision and was diagnosed with a condition called Usher Syndrome which affects both hearing and vision while causing progressive degeneration of the retina. The syndrome ultimately results in extensive hearing and vision loss. For me, it meant I would become both deaf and blind.My whole world had changed. I had to resign from my job because I could no longer read, write or drive. Many of the daily things that I used to take for granted were now seemingly impossible. Luckily, my doctor referred me to CNIB.CNIB was there for me in this major challenge of my life. They guided me towards the resources and support I needed. I learned how to read braille, how to use a white cane properly, how to use a computer and how to slowly regain my independence.It was a big change, but CNIB was very helpful. They came to my house and helped make it easier for me to access things like the stove and microwave. When your independence is taken away from you, its a huge thing. When I was sighted, I never thought of that word, independence. Not once. Now everything I do is focused on getting it back.Thanks to the help of CNIB, I now live an active and fulfilling life and I am grateful that they were there to support and encourage me on my journey.- Diane, CNIB client","CNIB passionately provides community-based support to ensure Canadians who are blind or partially sighted have the confidence, skills and opportunities to fully participate in life.With seven offices throughout Alberta and Northwest Territories, we are a national organization with a strong local presence.From toddlers who are born blind to seniors who develop age-related vision loss, our personalized vision rehabilitation services are offered to all age groups  at no cost to our clients.Close your eyes and imagine that you have just lost your vision  and ask yourself: How will I cook my next meal? Can I find the nearest exit? How will I get home? How will I get to work? These are just some of the many questions our clients ask themselves every day  and this is why CNIBs vision rehabilitation programs are so vital. To our clients, we are more than a charity or a worthy cause, but a pathway to a life of independence.","CNIB Alberta and Northwest Territories offers a wide range of community-based programs and services thathelp people with vision loss:Learn how to maximize any remaining sight through our low vision assessments and services.Develop the skills needed to live independently in the comfort of their own homes.Receive individualized training for independent travel in their communities.Our community-based programs and services include:Peer support groups for clients of all ages.Training and consulting on the usage of assistive technology software and devices.Resources and community programming for children with vision loss  and their families.Internship and employment training for youth and adults.","There are various ways to support CNIB Alberta and Northwest Territories and help us be there for every person living with vision loss who walks through our doors.You can support our programs and services by donating a one-time gift, a monthly gift, a planned gift or a legacy gift by writing CNIB into your will.In addition to making a donation, you can alsofundraise for CNIB​,attend a CNIB event​in your community, orjoin our passionate volunteer team​and make a difference through your time and skills.Companies can contribute by sponsoring or participating in one of our signature fundraising events or by sponsoring or donating to a particular CNIB program or service.If you would like to contribute to CNIB, click on the link below:http://www.cnib.ca/en/get-involved/make-a-gift/Pages/default.aspx","cnib.ca/alberta","andy.tse@cnib.ca","119219459RR0003","403.261.7221","Andy Tse ","8159452","disabl girl hear societi",95,0.0294573643410853,0.089922480620155,0.0248062015503876,0.0387596899224806,0.0666666666666667,0.0248062015503876,0.0527131782945736,0.0666666666666667,0.122480620155039,0.0341085271317829,0.0713178294573643,0.0387596899224806,0.0294573643410853,0.248062015503876,0.062015503875969

This iconic image is the southern Alberta landscape.When Phil Nykyforuk came to live in Calgary with his family in 1993, he was awe-stricken with the beauty of southern Alberta and saw the value in protecting it. Phil had been studying at the University of Pennsylvania, and when he arrived here he spent countless weekends hiking and taking photos in Albertas wilderness. Phil was struck by the contrast between the state of nature in Americas industrial heartland and in southern Alberta. He realized that there was still an opportunity here to get it right.Phil wanted to contribute to safeguarding this region and its wilderness values for his children and grandchildren. This is what led him to volunteer with the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society Southern Alberta Chapter (CPAWS SAB). Phil chose to volunteer and support CPAWS because:He saw a non-partisan, well-respected, active, on-the-ground local chapter of a proven national organization, and one with a strong record of success in protecting public lands.He valued CPAWS mandate of protecting parks and wilderness, using science as a base for finding solutions to conservation issues, and working cooperatively with all stakeholders.He supported CPAWS Southern Albertas strong award-winning environmental education program and efforts to promote environmental stewardship.Phil has been part of CPAWS Southern Albertas efforts for over 15 years. In that time, he has helped the beautiful Whaleback region become a protected landscape, helped get grizzly bears listed as a threatened species provincially, helped stop Bill 29 that would have decreased protection in our provincial park designation system and he has helped put a moratorium on logging in the Castle to name just a few successes.Phil is contributing to CPAWS Southern Alberta to ensure a healthy future so that, as he has said, his children and grandchildren wont read a textbook and wonder about what we once had and what was lost.","Since 1963 CPAWS has led in creating over two-thirds of Canadas protected areas. That amounts to about half a million square kilometres - an area bigger than the entire Yukon Territory! Our vision is that Canada will protect at least half of our public land and water.CPAWS Southern Alberta is one of 13 chapters across the country that focuses on protecting parks and natural ecosystems. It is a leader in landscape-scale wilderness conservation, national and provincial park management, establishment and protection of parks, and environmental education.Through our Education Programs we encourage our next generation of Canadians to enjoy our wild places and understand the importance of conserving them. In 2015 we will reach over 100,000 students and teachers with our curriculum based programs which focus on species at risk, watershed and grizzly bear conservation, and the importance of protecting parks and wilderness. We are also expanding our program toinclude adult education including new immigrants and corporate groups.","Our role is to provide landscape scale, science-based support and advice for the conservation and protection of Albertas protected areas and wildlands. Albertans expect that our voice is at the table to address critical environmental issues with multiple stakeholders. Some of our success include the establishment of the Bow Valley Protected Area (1988), working to get overpasses built over the trans Canada highway in Banff National Park (1995) and seeing grizzly bears listed as threatened under the Alberta Wildlife Act (2010).EDUCATION| Since 1997, CPAWS SAB has provided educational opportunities to communicate conservation messaging deeper into the community. We have reached nearly 100,000 students and teachers in Calgary and surrounding areas. Our programs include in-class programs, hikes and teacher workshops, from Grades 2-12. The focus of these programs includes grizzly bear ecology and conservation, endangered species and water conservation, and stewardship. By engaging elementary and secondary students in rich science and education experiences today, we are encouraging and mentoring the environmental stewards of tomorrow.We seek to create a community of knowledgeable empowered citizens who engage in stewardship and positive action to conserve our natural areas and wildlife.

How will you keep warm or travel?It may be hard to picture, and too far in the future to worry about, but we shouldnt take our energy supply for granted. Electricity can be generated from solar, wind, geothermal and nuclear energy, but currently these technologies are too expensive, and too inefficient, to replace petroleum on a global scale.Who will find and develop the technology to exploit the non-renewable resources we are certain to need in the future? Geoscientists!There is a direct connection between everyday items we know and love and the natural resources they come from. Where did your fleece jacket come from? Not mega-mart; it is derived from petroleum products. Did you know that your smart phone has precious metals and minerals in it? How will you charge up your solar-powered car if the sun doesnt shine? How is electricity generated for your electric car? With the rise of greenhouse gases and carbon taxes there is increasing pressure to cut carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants, and nuclear energy is curtailed by public fear. Geothermal energy isnt widely available, while solar and wind resources are sporadic and the infrastructure takes up space. Water resources are precious and will become political issues.

I participated in the life skills workshop conducted by Canadian Women for Women in Afghanistan.I learned many things from this workshop that were new for me like what a complete meal is and a healthy diet, how to wash my hands and teeth properly to remove germs and bacteria, and the difference between transferable and nontransferable diseases and how to protect myself and my family.Honestly, now I am feeling healthier than ever before and it gives me a nice feeling to help others in my family as well as use my time in a more effective way.We are living in a village where most of us were illiterate and uneducated. We havent been out of our village and didnt have access to any programs through which to learn about the importance of education, or to teach us literacy or anything that makes our lives better.I am very glad that I came to this class, which not only made me literate but also taught me a better life style.-----Our History:It All Started in CalgaryIn 1997, Calgarians, Janice Eisenhauer and Carolyn Reicher met while completing a senior Development Studies course at the University of Calgary. Shocked by the human rights violations Afghan women were facing under the Taliban regime, they began to explore how they as Canadian women could help Afghan women in a tangible and effective way.Calgary became the national office of CW4WAfghan and has remained one of the most robust and active chapters in our network. There are 720 Calgary and area residents who reach out in support our goals and objectives by attending our events, volunteering or keeping informed through signing up for our monthly news bulletins. Each year the local members bring together more than 600 Calgarians for its annual gala, featuring international human rights advocates like news anchor Lisa LaFlamme in 2015. Last fall the Calgary chapter hosted the CW4WAfghan National Symposium at Banff Park Lodge to connectvolunteers from all over Canada who share a passion and commitment to improving human rights in Afghanistan. Throughout the year CW4WAfghan Calgary engages students from elementary through high school who volunteer at our events, host our speakers in their classrooms, and have started their own movements in support of human rights. A decade ago, students from George McDougall High School in Airdrie collaborated with the chapter to found Students 4 Change. This group, led by Calgary member and teacher Glyn Hughes, collaborated with us to develop our online, free Teachers Resource Kit (www.cw4wafghan.ca/resources/educators-resource-kit)which is now used throughout Alberta. Students 4 Change continue to hold an annual breaking bread event and have raised thousands of dollars for education programs in Afghanistan.I was inspired by Mr. Glyn Hughes, a very admirable, motivated social studies teacher at my high school to join a group called S4C. This group has since changed my perspective of the world, enabled me to become a critical thinker and empowered me to make change happen.  --S4C StudentThe chapter also has organized International Womens Day events throughout the city, provides speakers for The University of Calgary, and works with the network of Calgary and area Rotary and other service clubs to raise awareness about human rights in Afghanistan. The organization received the Calgary YMCA Peace Award, and founder, Janice Eisenhauer has been honoured with the 2005 Alberta Centennial Medal; the 2014 City of Calgary Signature Award, and most recently in 2015, the Alberta Award of Excellence.From our beginnings in Calgary unfolds many more remarkable stories of how people from all across the country have joined together in solidarity as members of this uniquely Canadian network:Canadian Women for Women in Afghanistan.","Fifteen years ago the Taliban regime ruled Afghanistan with a closed mind and an iron fist. In the last decade, Afghan women have made significant advances, in education, in the professions and business, in political participation, and in media and culture. Human development has improved, and many women are taking part in public life. Yet many women are still denied their basic rights, violence against women is rampant, and barriers exist to accessing education. Female teachers have been threatened with death; rural schools have been burned; and the Taliban threaten families who send their daughters to school. Millions of women and girls continue to live a harsh reality marked by extreme poverty and oppression. Canadian Women for Women in Afghanistan (CW4WAfghan) was established to bring together the efforts of Canadians who are passionate about improving the lives of Afghan women and girls.CW4WAfghan is a not-for-profit charitable organization with 13 chapters and more than 800 volunteer members across Canada who support 20 Afghan program staff in Afghanistan.Members: Afghan and Canadian members believe that the path to true peace in Afghanistanis through education. To that end, they work to advance education and educationalopportunities for Afghan women and their families, and to educate Canadians about human rights in Afghanistan.Mission: Canadians taking action, in partnership with Afghan women, towards improving conditionsof human rights, ending womens oppression, and providing opportunities for Afghanwomen to live their lives with dignity, certainty and purpose.Values: CW4WAfghan members believe that individuals, as global citizens, working in solidarityand with integrity of purpose and action, can affect positive change in the world througheducation and the promotion of social justice and human rights.Goal: To ensure effective long-term sustainable education programs for Afghan women and theirfamilies and to engage Canadians as global citizens.StructureCanadian Board of Directors with cross-Canada representationProject Management Team overseeing project and program design and performance and project management committeesAfghanistan Country Office with 20 Afghan staff in KabulAccomplishmentsOur investments in our Basic Education Program are improving the quality of education by training teachers who are working in classrooms, and expanding their access to educator resources through our Lantern Teacher Education Program. We equip schools with Science Lab and Library Starter Kits and we provide training to teachers on how to make the best use of these tools. We also support two community schools, the Fatema Tul Zahra schools in Kabul and in Maimana, Faryab. Finally, we provide funding to support vulnerable women and girls to access education through the Shafia Fund, with small scholarships to cover educational costs such as school fees.MILESTONES2014-2015Lantern: Teacher Training In Afghanistan: Since the launch of the teacher education program in 2008, 7,600 teachers have been trained in Afghanistan and 188 Science Lab Starter Kits and 202 School Library Starter Kits have been distributed. Over 50% of the teachers trained in 2014 were female. We signed a new 3-year protocol with Afghan Government to train 3,600 teachers and launched the Lantern Program in a new province, Kapisa. Exceptional improvement was demonstrated by Lantern-trained female teachers during classroom observation visits, with unprecedented evidence of application of active learning methodsAfghanistan Reads! | Afghanistan Lowalee! Community Libraries and Literacy Program: In 2014, nearly 600 literacy students graduated from the Afghanistan Reads! Program in six provinces. In partnership with the Linda Norgrove Foundation, the program put literacy within reach of adult woman and out-of-school girls through basic literacy programs; reinforces literacy by nurturing a culture of reading; encourages excellence in the teaching of literacy; and ties classes in with other skills development, including livelihoods and like skills like health, hygiene, and nutrition. Recent assessment found momentous improvement in students reading and writing skills; increased confidence and presentation skills; and increased participation in the life of their village after literacy classes, such as speaking up in village meetings or taking on leadership roles in their communities.Darakht-e DaneshKnowledge TreeOnlineLibrary for Afghan Educators: After many years in the development stages, CW4WAfghan proudly launched the The Darakht-e Danesh Library, Afghanistans first comprehensive digital educational resource collection! The Library is housed within an interactive, multilingual custom-designed web platform, and is comprised of more than 1,600 resources in 14 subject categories, for both primary and secondary teachers. Users register at www.darakhtdanesh.org where they can then search the database to download or print diverse educational materials, as well as upload their own materials to share with others.

This initiative provides educational and economic opportunities to previously unemployed and unskilled Afghan women through fair trade wages and skills development. A small profit from product sales provides chapter members with resources for their public engagement activities in Canada.Since 1996, CW4WAfghan has continually worked toward a mutual relationship of trust and accountability with non-profit Afghan organizations with programmes designed by or for Afghan women. This is done through establishing thorough reporting, monitoring and evaluation procedures.Our organization selects beneficiaries, particularly Afghan women and children in under-served areas, who will benefit most directly from our support. We carefully select those Afghan organizations or individuals who have the proven reputation, expertise and experience to carry out our projects.To assist with running our programs, we have established a small office in Kabul managed by our Country Director. Our executive members in Canada travel to Afghanistan when possible (when security allows and funding is available) to further strengthen, evaluate and monitor our projects. Our Canadian Project Committee also oversees all management of the projects and communication via email, teleconference and mail in conjunction with our Kabul office. This committee is chaired by our Projects Director, who is under a part-time contract with CW4WAfghan as part of our overseas project management. The Committee reviews regular project reports, and meets several times throughout the year for our program planning, monitoring and evaluation. They oversee the formal written contracts with our implementing partner organizations which outline the terms of the project, the work plans and budgets, as well as specific roles and responsibilities and reporting requirements.Our program activities meet the charitable requirements of Canada Revenue Agency in line with our approved purposes: advancing education and educational opportunities for Afghan women and girls.CW4WAfghan Programs and ProjectsFatema‐Tul‐Zahra Schools:The FTZ schools provide basic education from grades 1-10 for hundreds of disadvantaged children in two locations, Faryab and Kabul, as well as clothing, food, medicine and healthcare, books and supplies, school lunches, and orphans boarding.Womens Literacy Classes:We support basic literacy classes for adult women and out-of-school girls in Kabul, Balkh, Herat, Kapisa and Badakhshan. The classes also provide health, hygiene, nutrition, rights and livelihood education, and access to a library for new readers.Teacher Training:Our largest project is the Fanoos Teacher Training Program, which trains in-service female and male secondary teachers with no previous training. This project has trained over 7,000 teachers since 2008 in Kabul, Panjshir, Laghman and Parwan. To sustain this program, The Lantern Fund was launched as a unique campaign to provide donors with the opportunity to contribute:lighting a candle that burns to enlighten others, an Afghan proverb used to describe the role of teachers.School Science Labs:Our teacher training program emphasizes hands-on science and active student-centred learning. To support this kind of teaching, we aim to equip all participating schools, approximately 50 annually, with School Lab Starter Kits, each containing over 130 items from a microscope and anatomy models to chemicals, allowing for classrooms experiments, demonstrations and bringing science to life.School and Community Libraries:For literacy to be sustained, new readers need access to books. Thats why weve been working to place libraries in all of our literacy classes for the students and their families, as well as in every school where weve trained the teachers. These library kits include 500 volumes plus shelving and CW4WAfghan provides librarianship training for teachers, and ongoing monitoring.The Darakht‐e Danesh Library for Afghan Educators:As part of our teacher training work, weve developed a collection of 1,200 educator resources, housed in an online multilingual library called Darakht-e Danesh (knowledge tree). We are further developing this collection, and also have plans to open a Teachers E-Learning Centre in Kabul where teachers can access these local-language educational materials that help teachers further build their content knowledge.Event Sponsorship for Global Citizenship:Our annual symposium every October focuses on education in Afghanistan and is a critical part of our public engagement work in Canada, drawing in new volunteers and supporters while educating the public through exposure to Afghan guest speakers, workshops and panels.","Help us take action, in partnership with Afghan women and girls, to improve conditions of human rights, to end womens oppression, and to provide opportunities for Afghan women to live with dignity, certainty and purpose.VOLUNTEERThe heart of CW4WAfghan is the remarkable and unique skills and commitment of every volunteer member across Canada!

"99",658,"Canmore Museum and Geoscience Centre","Several years ago, we were settled in the heart of Canmore coastingalong with a ten-year-old exhibit, but then we had our own version of Noahs flood! However,we have nowrisen from the waters and can proclaim we have a new exhibit and renewedvigour. We raised $200,000 and in March 2016 we opened a new exhibit totell the story of how our community became stronger and more connected.This new exhibit tells the stories of our mountains andcommunities with a series ofvignettes. It starts with thegeologicalsetting of the region and moves through stories about native people, the comingof theEuropean explorers, the railway, coalmining, quarrying,the1988 winter Olympics and the development ofthe Canmore community through torecent times.We EXIST to tell stories. Thats what we do! Our mission is to:Tell thestoriesof our mountains and our communities to you.Our purpose is to bean authoritative resource centre in the Canmore area for the preservation and exhibition of the historical and geo-scientific heritage of the Bow Valley. Weve been in continuous operation since our 84 incorporation and achieved official Museum status in 07.Come and visit us the next time you are in Canmore. We are open seven days a week.","In a normal year we entertain over20,000visitors and localsvisiting our two facilities and participating in our various programs. We run the Museum and the North West Mounted Police Barracks in Canmore and this is what you will discover when you visit the two venues:Our main facility is our Museum, at the Canmore Civic Centre in the centre of Canmore.As of March 2016, our newpermanent exhibition: From Coal to Community tellsstories of both the geological and social history of the area. There are hands-on opportunities for everyone and videos provide information about the history of the Canmore area. The Museum is open seven days a week, all year long, except for a couple of daysat Christmas.The other facility istheNorth West Mounties Police (NWMP) Barracks, situated on the high Street in Canmore. This attractive, white-painted, log cabin style building was erected in 1893 to house a contingent of the NWMPas the area developed rapidly due to the arrival of the railway. This is a heritage building and a small exhibit in the buildingtells the story of the arrival of the mounties and the subsequent history of the people who lived in it. This is where we tell the rest of the stories, especially of life in the early part of Canmores history. During winter months we rely on volunteers to run the facility which is open, on average, three days a weekincluding the weekends. During the summer we employ students who keep the facility open seven days a week.A third component of how we carry out our mandate is the development of education programs, particularly those to complement grade school curricula. We recently partnered with Lafarge to develop a program for grade 3classes whereby the childrenvisit the Museum and Lafarges premises at Exshaw tolearn all about the rocks and minerals of our area and about making cement out of the raw material found in the valley.In addition to permanent exhibits, we plan a series of temporary exhibits within the permanent space over time. The first of these exhibits will feature Graymonts quarry operations (as opposed to Lafarges) in the Exshaw area. This exhibit is currently being developed and is scheduled to open sometime in the Spring of 2017.We have a board, comprised oftwelve people, who meet regularly once a month to work on normal board activities such as fundraising, planning, governance, etc., and who also roll up their sleeves and get involved directly inmany of the programs of the Society.Our 2017 annual budgetis $457,000, fundsto be provided as follows;$145,000 Town of Canmore grant  $101,000 Other grants  $121,000 Donations   $51,000 Retail $39,000Admissions and programsThisbudget includes a provision for raising at least $100,000 for the Lamp House project.

These programs include:The very popular coal mine tours, led by local mining expert, Gerry Stephenson.Other geological and historical tours.Gift shop services.Childrens programs in partnership with the Town of Canmore;Big Fun Summer CampsArt in the Park where artists display their creations in the garden of the NWMP Barracks.Research opportunities for individuals (writers, historians, geologists and local students).Support of local organization events such as the Miners Day Parade, Ladies Hospital Auxiliary, etc.Family programs such as Easter, Halloween and Christmas fairs, paper making workshops and a rock and fossil clinic.Storage, documentation and preservation of historical and geo-scientific artifacts and information about the Canmore region.Opportunities for people to volunteer in the Canmore and Calgary communities (e.g., Mount Royal University students in Calgary leading our Grassi Lakes program)An educational program in support of the grade 3 rocks and mineralscurriculum, developed in partnership with Lafarge. Other educational programs in support of grade 4, 6 and 7 curricula are being planned to start within the next 12 months. All grade 3 classes in theCanmore/Banff areaparticipated in our programs in the fall of 2016. News of the success of the program appears to have reached Calgary in that at least one school has already requested to participate in the program in the spring of 2017. Our plans are to develop similar programs to complement grades 4, 6 and 7 school curricula in the next 12 months..","We invite you to visit our Museum at the Civic Centre and the NWMP Barracksin the heart of Canmore and learn aboutourmountains, our coalminingheritage and our social history.You can VOLUNTEER:Meet people from around the world, be an ambassador, and engage locals and visitors in our unique history.

The stone building, known as the Lamp House, is the only building still standing from the Canmore mines. It is currently fenced off and sits in a field near the old No. 2 mineshaft opening.Our project is to rebuild this long standing icon of the coal mining era on its present site and perhaps, who knows, even open up a small part of the nearby number 2 mine.We have basically the whole building there and Alberta Culture and Tourism was impressed it was all there, according to former Canmore resident David Evans, previous director with the societys board.  Source: Rocky Mountain Outlook - June 9, 2016: Canmore Museum focused on preservation of LamphouseThe historical importance of the site would also support it functioning as an interactive exhibit for the museum. Evans said his hope is to see a miners park with displays that show what the area used to look like with a coal mine operating.While fundraising efforts have not officially gotten off the ground, Evans said a few really good benefactors have pledged around $65,000. Current estimates to restore the building are around $150,000 he added.

"101",621,"Catholic Family Service of Calgary","I got pregnant at 16. A few months after my seventeenth birthday, I had a little boy named Dominick. Being so young and having a tiny baby to care for was terrifying.Thankfully, I had the full support of my parents. The only thing they insisted on was that I finish my education. I started researching schools that would allow me to bring my son, because I could not afford child care. When I heard about the Louise Dean Centre, I knew it was my only option.It wasnt until I started at Louise Dean in September 2001 that I realized how much of a blessing this school was. I was able to start working part-time after being approved for financial aid through the school. I met many strong and amazing girls who were in the same situation I was. They could all relate to what I was going through and, best of all, there was no judgment. My teachers were equally amazing; in fact all the staff were very supportive and caring. Louise Dean began to feel more like a second home than a school.Having the Learning Centre within the school to provide affordable child care while we studied was a tremendous privilege. I will always remember Mindy, who was Dominicks caregiver. She was the most wonderful woman I had ever met. All the anxiety and worry I had about leaving my young son with a stranger was instantly cured when I met Mindy and the other Learning Centre staff. They treated every child as if they were their own.After Louise Dean, I went to Bow Valley College for a year and then enrolled in the social work degree program at Mount Royal University. Then I met my now-husband Andrew. He was a pilot with Air Canada at the time and based in Toronto. After a few months of long hard thinking, I made the decision to be with him. I had to give up my acceptance to Mount Royal, but I enrolled in a business and health care college in Ontario and went on to graduate with a diploma in community social work.I am proud to say that today I am the mother of two amazing boys! Dominick is now 16 years old and in Grade 11. He is a very talented electric guitarist and in his second year of Midget hockey. In 2013, Andrew and I welcomed another little boy.He is the funniest, kindest, most caring little guy you will ever meet. He is obsessed with hockey, airplanes, dinosaurs, skateboarding, soccer and BMXing. If you ask him how old he is, he will tell you he is 16, just like his big brother.I have always imagined the day when I would be in a position to give back to the place that gave me my start in life. And for the past three years, my family has been in that position. For me its more than just donating items to these young moms. Being involved in the Santa Sleigh Project is my way of showing them that just because they had a baby younger than most, success is not impossible  all of them can go on to fulfill their dreams.Thank you to Elisa Revoy for sharing her story with us after participating in the 2016 Santa Sleigh Project at Louise Dean Centre.The Louise Dean Centre is a partnership between Catholic Family Service, Calgary Board of Education and Alberta Health Services. Louise Dean Centre provides pregnant and parenting teens, their children and families with educational and health care support, as well as helping them deal with the emotional and social needs that come with pregnancy and parenting.

At CFS, we are driven by compassion - not religion. Our counselling, education and community outreach programs are effective because we dont prescribe solutions - we build relationships. We know that when people feel safe and understood, it can profoundly change the course of their lives. With us, people are supported to work through issues like family breakdown, trauma and abuse, so they can move forward and live the life theyve always wanted.Humanity Above All Else is our mantra. In 1957, CFS was founded on the belief that counselling should be available to everyone regardless of their ability to pay. In the 1960s, CFS took a bold, unorthodox stance and prioritized services to unwed mothers. Over the years, we have continued to innovate. Recognizing the importance of community connection, we expanded programming to connect vulnerable people to bigger society systems, including schools and communities. Everyone needs a place to belong.In 2009, CFS launched the Unlocking Potential (UP) Foundation to work directly with the community to provide long-term, sustainable funding to our critical services.MISSION: Catholic Family Service delivers high-impact solutions that build healthy individuals, families and communities.VISION: Vulnerable Calgarians thrive.VALUES: Courageous LeadershipKindnessCommunityRespectServiceAccountabilityGUIDING PRINCIPLES:Collaboration and community buildingAccessible, barrier-free, and response serviceRelationship focusEmbrace diversity","CFS builds stronger families through approximately 20 programs that facilitate good mental health and wellbeing, empower parents and leaders in their families and communities, promote healthy child development, and foster success in school for people of all ages. We focus on providing affordable, accessible, and respectful services to people of all ages, faiths and cultures. Over the past 60 years, our services have been woven into the communities where our clients live, work, and go to school. Services include the Louise Dean Centre, Community Services, and Counselling Services.At 15 years old, pregnant and scared, A made the bold decision to parent and stay in school. With our support at the Louise Dean Centre, this young mother beat the typical stereotype associated with youth pregnancy. She graduated from high school, obtained a Masters Degree, and is now a solid and contributing Calgary citizen. Her child, now a young adult, is also thriving and seeking a higher education.To call the Louise Dean Centre a school is a vast understatement. They had everything that we needed right there...and they met us on our level - barely out of childhood and heavy with the responsibilities of an adult - without the resources or wisdom of one. What I love about the program is that they seem to have identified every barrier that a young mother could face and then worked diligently to eradicate them. I had a team of people there to support me and if I didnt show up for school, they would find me and ask How can we help you to get to school today? What do you need? - a Louise Dean Centre graduate.At CFS, heros like this young woman find the strength within their adversity to move on and create positive, healthy change.Affordable Counselling helps families, couples, adults and children work through issues that create barriers to living a healthy life.It doesnt seem like that long ago that I felt heavy and hopeless. Things have changed a great deal since I began counselling. Ive stayed strong through some tough decisions. My daughter has improved 100%. The anger and potential self-destructive behavior are gone. She went from wanting to run away to never wanting to move out!​I am gaining more confidence every day and the anxiety attacks are virtually gone. I bought a house and am very happy there. I remember leaving my counsellors office the last time feeling a little lighter. Those feelings have continued with every step I have taken since then. - Client, General CounsellingCommunity Services help strengthen children and families by building on the connections they have with schools and neighbourhoods.Our family had drifted apart - maybe we just never really knew how to be a family. As parents, we were so caught up in the tension of trying to make a living, we forgot to enjoy our family. The Families and Schools Together (FST) program brought us back together. Now we love to turn off the TV, eat together and share stories about our day. Before FST, I thought that our kids didnt talk to us because they did not have much to say. Now I think that they didnt talk to us because we didnt know how to listen. - Parent, FSTFathers are making positive changes in their lives too.No one in my family had ever graduated. So when I dropped out of Grade 10, it was no big deal. With lots of time on my hands, I got tangled up with the law. After my girlfriend got pregnant, I knew I wanted something different for us but it seemed like every solution needed money - something we didnt have. -Larry, Never Too Late graduateLarry heard about the Never Too Late Program, a free adult GED preparation program. Now that fits into his budget! Larry says,I wanted to be my daughters hero and for her to know that her dad thinks education matters and was willing to work for it. The Never Too Late Program connected me to other students with similar goals and program staff that really cared about me. Id never experienced that before.Louise Dean Centresupports pregnant and parenting teens achieve success for themselves and their children through counselling, parenting education, and early childhood programs.Reflecting on what I have been through, I realize what a strong and capable person I am.

To discuss options, please contact Jessica Williams, Managing Director of Stakeholder Relations at 403-205-5222 jessica.williams@cfs-ab.orgOur Greatest NeedsAffordable Counselling Affordable Counselling helps individuals, couples and families to work through issues that create barriers to living a healthy, happy and fulfilling life. A range of life events  daily stress, loss and grief, parenting challenges, marital or relationship struggles, trauma, and addiction  are addressed by Counselling Services at CFS. Counselling improves well-being, reduces mental health concerns, and strengthens relationships.Painful and expensive outcomes (such as hospitalization) can be prevented when individuals and families access counselling. For parents who experienced abuse or neglect in childhood, counselling ensures their trauma is not passed on to their children: counselling is an intervention strategy for one generation of a family and a prevention strategy for the next.Counselling Services at CFS strives to eliminate barriers clients may face in accessing counselling. More than 60% of people who access counselling at CFS have household incomes less than $60,000. Donations to the counselling program ensure that professional counselling services are available to people at a rate they can afford.$250,000 is required annually to ensure that professional services continue to be available at a rate that does not present a barrier to individuals and families with lower incomes. More than 1,000 people access Counselling Services each year.Families and Schools Together Families and Schools Together strengthens children by building relationships between the people who care about them: parents, teachers, school staff, and other members of their community. These relationships are an important protective factor for children to grow up happy and healthy.Child development can be thought of as a teeter-totter that can be tipped one way or another. Positive experiences get placed on one side; negative experiences on the other. Weight can be added to or taken from a childs teeter-totter at any time, and every adult in a childs life influences the direction teeter-totter tips.Families and Schools Together tips the teeter-totter towards the positive side by heaping on strong family bonds, healthy family communication, and frequent, positive communication between parents and teachers. The program also relieves some of the weight on the negative side, such as parent stress and isolation.Resilience happens when the scale tips positive although its stacked with negative weight. By strengthening the childs network of support, Families and Schools Together helps children to be more resilient, no matter what they encounter as they grow up.Families and Schools Together operates in public and separate schools. Families meet together with teachers and CFS staff in their childs school once per week for nine weeks. Each nine-week session serves approximately 15 families.$100,000 is required annually to ensure Families and Schools Together can serve over 100 families at seven elementary schools.Louise Dean Centre To provide a stable and nurturing environment for their children, young mothers have to build a number of skills to get and keep their own lives on track while also mastering positive parenting practices. This multi-skill development can be thought of as a rope with interwoven strands. At Louise Dean Centre, young mothers have the opportunity learn and weave together academic and learning skills (CBE); healthy life style skills (AHS); and parenting, financial literacy, healthy relationship and life skills (CFS). Although it takes time, the ropes young mothers weave become anchors for the healthy development of their children.If one anchor for healthy child development is good, two is better. Thats why CFS launched Fathers Moving Forward for fathers under age 26. Fathers Moving Forward helps young fathers weave their own ropes with skills in parenting, co-parenting, employability and financial literacy. Regardless of a romantic relationship, when young moms and dads weave their ropes together, they create a secure environment where their child can begin weaving their own skills rope. These ropes begin forming in infancy, so a swift community response is required to ensure young moms and dads are able to raise healthy children.$175,000 is required to offer skill development through parent education, counselling, and groups to the 400+ young parents who access Louise Dean Centre each year.Never Too Late The Never Too Late program provides academic, social and emotional support so low-income adults within target communities can successfully complete the GED exam, an Alberta Education High School Equivalency Diploma.Never Too Late is embedded in communities where income levels and educational achievement rates are low compared with the norm for Calgary. By offering a community-based option and emotional support at no cost, Never Too Late reduces the barriers students may face when accessing a GED program, such as transportation, fees and school supplies, and anxiety.Never Too Late serves the greater Bowness area. These communities, including Ranchlands, Silver Springs, and Montgomery, were selected because of their high drop-out rate  a concern for communities, because people are more likely to live in poverty when they dont have a high school diploma. A retrospective study with Never Too Late graduates in 2012 showed that the students who increased their income after passing the GED exam did so by an average of $17,000. Never Too Late also breaks the cycle of low education and poverty in families: a top predictor of a childs likelihood of completing high school is having a parent who is a high school graduate.$180,000 is required to expand Never Too Late into a new community, as the program is currently offered only in the greater Bowness area. Each year 60 students participate in Never Too Late.","www.cfs-ab.org","patricia.jones@cfs-ab.org","106880172RR0001","403.205.5200","Patricia Jones","9268857","famili children parent child",101,0.0354740061162079,0.0318042813455657,0.0116207951070336,0.0483180428134557,0.018960244648318,0.0226299694189602,0.0409785932721713,0.0391437308868502,0.0574923547400612,0.0556574923547401,0.00978593272171254,0.178593272171254,0.0134556574923547,0.053822629969419,0.382262996941896
"102",398,"Centre for Affordable Water and Sanitation Technology (CAWST)","CAWST is addressing a major humanitarian need: the fact that half the worlds population lacks access to safe water or sanitation.The standard response to this crisis typically focuses on infrastructure, such as hand-pumps, wells and toilets, rather than on equipping local populations with the knowledge and skills they need to sustainably solve their water and sanitation needs.That is where CAWST steps in. We provide professional education and training services to organizations worldwide to ensure their water, sanitation and hygiene programs are effective, replicable and sustainable.What does that look like on the ground? It looks like a woman in Zambia named Mary Banda.Mary illustrates the incredible impact one person can have when they gain the knowledge and skills to provide clean drinking water and somewhere safe to go to the bathroom for their families. With that knowledge, they can then help other families in their community experience the same formative change.Mary first encountered CAWST in 2006. She had lost her husband and was the single mother of six children living in a poor area on the outskirts of a town called Ndola. When she learned that her childrens health problems were linked to unsafe drinking water, Mary set-out on a mission to improve the health of her family, and her community.Mary attended a workshop provided by CAWSTs partner in Zambia, Seeds of Hope International Partnerships (SHIP), where she gained the knowledge and skills she needed to understand why the water in her community was unsafe, how it was affecting her familys health and how to ensure her family could sustainably access safe drinking water and sanitation.The impact was immediate. Having seen her familys health improve, Mary set out on a quest to expand access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation in her community. Nearly a decade later, Mary has helped build over 5,700 biosand filters and has made over 300 household visits as a community health promoter. She has been certified by CAWST as a biosand filter technician -- the first woman in Africa to achieve that designation.The impact Mary achieved once she was equipped with the knowledge and skills needed to enact change in her community is but one example, among thousands, of how CAWSTs focus on knowledge and skills results in meaningful, sustainable change.----Access to clean water is a human right, and yet still half the world lacks access to safe drinking water or sanitation. CAWST was born in Calgary to address this crisis in the most sustainable manner: by teaching local populations how to address their safe drinking water and basic sanitation needs and then supporting them in their actions.CAWST is proud of its Calgary roots, having been founded by Calgarians, while one of the key solutions we teach people how to build and maintain, the biosand filter, was invented at the University of Calgary.CAWST educates local organizations, government agencies and community-level individuals how to sustainably expand access to safe drinking water and sanitation. This model of education and consulting support allows us to magnify our reach by ensuring the clients we train are implementing appropriate, effective and sustainable water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) project. CAWST has a target of reaching 20 million people with safe drinking water or sanitation by 2020.","CAWST is not only helping millions of people worldwide to gain access to the safe water and sanitation they need to live healthy, productive lives; we are developing the local leaders of tomorrow in the 68 countries where we work worldwide.We believe deeply in the capability of local populations to identify, implement and sustain their own solutions. When we provide people with crucial knowledge and skills, we unlock their potential to drive change in their communities.Most importantly, we stick around, so that people know we are available to support them in their action. When they face a hurdle in their efforts to improve the water and sanitation conditions in their community, they know we are available to help them find a solution. This way, challenges are overcome rather than derailing a project.We do this by:Training-- We offer a comprehensive suite of training workshops, which we deliver directly and which we train local organizations on so that they can deliver this training locally, independent of CAWST.Education Materials -- We provide the worlds largest online collection of free water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) educational resources so that individuals and organizations worldwide can access the knowledge they need, when they need it.Technical Support-- Our field staff provide consulting support to practitioners using a mentorship and coaching approach. This ongoing technical support is delivered through site visits, email, Skype, online training and phone, covering project start-up, scale-up and troubleshooting.Action Research-- We mentor clients in action research, project evaluation, measuring and reporting organizational outcomes and impacts, data management and data analysis. We distill research into practical knowledge so that it is applicable and relevant to practitioners worldwide.Accomplishments:11.4 million peopleare using better water or sanitation technologies as a result of projects implemented by our 970 clients in 78 countries.5.0 million peoplehave been trained using CAWSTs training and education materials.$2.17: The amount CAWST has spent per person affected by CAWSTs clients.CAWSTsvisionis a world where people have the opportunity to succeed because their basic water and sanitation needs have been met. CAWSTsmissionis to provide technical training and consulting in water and sanitation for the poor.","Internationally, CAWST works directly with client organizations in 78 countries. Much of our work is focused on eight countries: Afghanistan, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Haiti, Honduras, Lao PDR, Nepal and Zambia.In each of those eight countries we have partnered with in-country organizations to create locally-staffed centres (called Water Expertise and Training (WET) Centres) that provide locally-adapted water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) training and education services.The WET Centres are core to our strategy of addressing the global water and sanitation crisis by building local knowledge and skills. Over time, the WET Centres become increasingly independent, allowing CAWST to expand its focus to other countries knowing that the WET Centres are doing locally what CAWST does globally.These WET Centres are key to sustainable development, as they are run by local staff who ensure that water and sanitation solutions are locally-appropriate and sustained.This innovative process of mentoring and coaching by CAWST allows the WET Centre to deliver more than 80 per cent of its own training and consulting support services, which allows us to make a deep and sustainable impact on WASH issues - Evans Chiyenge, manager of the Zambia WET Centre.CAWST has given us something that no one can take away from us - the knowledge, and the empowerment to do something with that knowledge. We are all working together towards the same objective of improving access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation. - Maria Inestroza, Honduras WET Centre.CAWST also operates a Virtual WET Centre designed to make WASH resources and training available to anyone with an internet connection. For example, CAWSTs WASH Resources website features the worlds largest online collection of WASH education and training resources and has over 6,500 registered users from 164 countries.Domestically, CAWST educates Canadian youth on local and global water issues through its Youth Wavemakers program. Wavemakers is a unique program that empowers youth to take action on water issues meaningful to them. The program provides educators with tools to inform and engage youth on local and global water issues, and helps to catalyze independent action through experiential learning components. There is an annual Youth Summit, which provides a platform for youth to launch Action Projects. Wavemakers provides youth with seed grants to support their projects, and mentorship is provided to aid the project in coming to fruition. These youth then get the chance to showcase their projects at CAWSTs annual World Water Day event, which is Calgarys largest celebration of World Water Day. Since 2008 the Wavemakers program has reached 28,000 educators and youth, who in turn have reached over 100,000 people through increasing awareness and taking action on water issues.","By supporting CAWSTs overseas service delivery, donors are achieving a ripple effect impact through CAWSTs training of thousands of organizations worldwide.When you support CAWST, you are helping to give a family the knowledge and skills they need to treat their own drinking water, build an appropriate latrine and practice healthy hygiene in the home. When a family is healthy, the parents can work, children can go to school and income can be used to support the family instead of being spent on hospital visits and medication.The long-term effect of empowering families is incredible. Not only is that one family healthy, but they are equipped to pass those knowledge and skills on to other families in their community.By supporting CAWSTs Virtual WET Centre, you can be on the leading edge of the innovative use of technology as a tool to help expand global access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation. Learn more about the resources CAWST offers at www.cawst.org/resources.By supporting CAWSTs Youth Wavemakers program, you can support the development of the leaders of tomorrow, both in Alberta and across Canada.

An engineer by profession, he was unable to immediately land a job in his field. Philip wasted no time juggling his time between survival jobs. His relationship with his family started to suffer as he came home every day, feeling exhausted, downhearted, and at times, feeling humiliated at the thought that he will not be able to live his dream as a successful professional in Calgary. Acknowledging his dilemma, he welcomed the offer of support from the Centre for Newcomers.At the Centre Philip and his wife upgraded their English language skills, worked with settlement and employment services staff to address their priorities. Inspired, and armed with his career plan, Philip pursued and finished a training course related to his profession. He continued to connect with the Centre as he applied for jobs. Though worried and down to their last $15, he received the good news, a job offer! Now a successful Project Co-ordinator for an Oil and Gas company, his success did not come easily. It took some time, risks and sacrifices.Thanks to a devoted team of professionals at the Centre for Newcomers. My family cannot thank you enough for the advice and suggestions to help me set my priorities. My wife has now adjusted to the new routine, working part time and being the super mom and wife.

Yet many need support to settle and integrate into their new community successfully. As a catalyst to achieve successful settlement and integration, the Centre partners with government and communities to provide life-changing services that build connections, create opportunities and promote participation and citizenship to the increasing number of newcomer families, children and individuals who call Calgary their home every year.","In 1988 the Centre for Newcomers was established to respond to the flow of refugees from civil wars in Central America, and quickly developed into an agency with a full suite of newcomer settlement, employment and English language services, open to newcomers from all backgrounds. The Centre supports newcomers to build a better life, to settle in a community where they can raise their families, to go to school and to work. Integration into the community is the cornerstone of the Centres work  bringing together newcomers with the receiving community for the benefit of both.For over 25 years, the Centre has served as a catalyst of transformation - a hub where several thousands of newcomers have made connections in Calgary, found jobs, supported to raise families and contributed to building this great city of promise.

Just like a plane crash, these deaths are preventable. Just like a plane crash, these people do not want to die. We can help them!Suicide is about ending pain, not about dying. It is hard to imagine pain so great, and hopelessness so deep, that one would take the irreversible act of suicide. Tragically, most suicides are preventable.Suicide affects both genders. In the approximate 4000 people who die by suicide every year in Canada, about 3000 are men. Women, however, attempt suicide 2  3 times more often than men, often ending up in hospital.Suicide spans every age. It is hard to believe children as young as 6 and 7 are attempting to end their own lives, yet shockingly this is happening. People over 65 now have the highest suicide rate of all age groups. Baby Boomers have had higher suicide rates than previous generations. There is concern as this cohort enters the 65 and older age range that this will translate into a tremendous increase in suicides in the coming years. Words like epidemic are being used to describe the emerging statistics.The stigma of suicide must not prevent us from acting.

"105",341,"Cerebral Palsy Association in Alberta (CPAA)","It was New Year s Eve, 1996 and a baby boy was finally born after keeping his parents waiting for two weeks overdue. They had been trying to have a baby for over five years, and as soon as the little one was born, he was immediately whisked away to the NICU for tests and monitoring. Nervous and anxious, they were finally allowed in to the NICU, only to see their newborn baby in an incubator, attached to scary tubes and monitors - not what new parents were expecting. They were told that he was having trouble breathing and was experiencing some seizures, but they had yet to determine the cause. Later that night, the doctor finally sat down with them and said, there has been some damage to his brain and there is a good chance your son will never walk or talk and will likely have to be tube fed, he has Cerebral Palsy.In the weeks following, the parents were completely numb but had unconditional love for their son like any new parents would. Throughout the first year and the hundreds of appointments with doctors and therapists, they hoped like any parent would, that their son would just be OK and healthy. Acceptance was one of the most difficult hurdles during this time. Throughout his first five years, he attended special preschools and by the time he started what would be the equivalent of grade one, they finally came to accept the cards they have been dealt and dedicated their lives to helping him progress and be happy.The family turned to the CPAA - not only to find answers and resources, but also in hopes of meeting other families to lean on. To their amazement, they were given an overwhelming amount of support. They have now turned their experience into a lifelong passion to help not only their son, but also other families to realize that things dont have to be as bad as they seem and that support is there, when they are ready to receive it.As we are now into 2015, this baby boy has just turned 18 and consistently keeps his parents on their toes - even eating them out of house and home! He may be non-verbal, and not as equipped to do as many things as his peers, but he has taught his family so much. His mother left her finance job after being in the industry for 13 years and decided to follow her newfound mission to ensure that her sons voice was heard. That mother is me. And I am proud to be Joshuas voice. I have been the Director of Development for the CPAA for the past eight years, I sit on National and International CP groups and am an advocate for social change and progress - simply trying to make a difference for families by providing hope and support, so that we can all live a life without limits.","The Cerebral Palsy Association in Alberta (CPAA) is a registered non-profit organization that supports people affected by cerebral palsy and other disabilities in the province of Alberta.

"106",331,"Champions Career Centre","Today, 9 more Calgarians had to face the reality of going to work with a disability. What would you do if you couldnt return to your job because of an illness? An accident? Or Genetic Disease? What if employers looked at you as damaged and wouldnt hire you?Without Champions, I dont know where Id be right now....Clients like Franky tell us I felt like no one wanted to hire me or even give me a chance. It was so great to come to Champions, to tell them about my life, talk about my learning disability and to get help with my job search. With Champions help, I have a great job with Home Depot that I love and am working hard to become a Head Cashier- Frank, 2013 Champion, Lot Associate - Home Depot.At Champions Career Centre, we offer all kinds of career and employment supports for both job seekers and employers. Before Champions, Frank struggled with his job search. He would land interviews but things didnt seem to progress beyond the interview. This broke down Franks confidence and he wasnt sure where to go from there. That is when he was introduced to Champions Career Centre. We decided that instead of providing the traditional group workshop, we would tailor our program to meet his specific needs. So we began working with him one-on-one building his interviewing skills and his confidence.We met with Frank to review his goals and challenges. In this meeting we discovered that he wasa very personable and determined individual who enjoyed helping people. Through our conversations with him we discovered that his skills and personality would make him a great asset for any company in a customer service role. Now Frank is known by name to customers, brings a smile to everyone he encounters, and has won multiple Homer awards for amazing customer service!A big misconception is that people with disabilities are different. One in six Albertans has a disability, and since we cant always see them, we dont think about things like arthritis, or diabetes, epilepsy, learning disorders, mental health illnesses, etc. as being a disability, but they are.We help individuals like Franky every single day. We are proud to be changing lives by creating inclusive workplaces and strong communities.See more of Franks story here","Champions is a pan-disability agency, which means we work with people who have visible or invisible disabilities.

"108",554,"Children's Legal and Educational Resource Centre Society (CLERC)","Hi my name is Josh. Im sixteen but my life is not like most of my friends. My parents divorced, which is pretty common, but the divorce was awful. I ended up living with my Mom which was not a good thing. She hated my Dad and to make it worse, she drank a lot. Living with her was hard. I ended up having to take care of her most of the time. Thankfully, I got to spend time with my Dad and my soon to be step-Mom, they were engaged. They cared about me and I actually felt safe with them. They wanted me to do well in school and I got to do other fun stuff too.I felt bad for my Mom but I decided I wanted to move in with my Dad and step-Mom when I turned 16. Just before my birthday, my Dad was in a car accident and he died. I felt like my life was turned upside down. I was at my Moms house surrounded by relatives who couldnt care less about me and what I was going through. I loved him, he was my Dad and he had just died. My Mom was drinking even more too. I couldnt talk to her or anyone. I felt so sad and hopeless; I didnt know what to do, but I knew I didnt want to be there.I tried to figure out a plan, but I had no idea how to do it. I had so many questions; I felt confused and alone. Could I live by myself and not with my Mom? Would I get in trouble? How would I register for school? Could I just leave home when I turned 16? Could I live with my step-Mom and have her take care of me? Would my Mom call the police and report my step-Mom if I went to live with her? Would anyone I lived with be arrested? All I really wanted was to move in with my step-Mom. I had already spent so much time with her and my Dad that I felt close to her  closer to her than my Mom.I decided to search on the net and found CLERC. I sent them a message explaining my situation and all my questions. They answered me right away and it seemed like they could help me. That gave me hope. The lawyer from CLERC met with me and she was able to answer all my questions and give me advice. It felt good to know that I could tell her anything and that she had a duty to be loyal to me and not tell anyone what I told her unless I gave her permission. I finally felt like there were things I could do to change my situation for the better and that CLERC would help me. It was cool that my step-Mom was able to be involved in the process. Eventually, CLERC represented me in court which was scary and not at all like on TV. I felt relieved when my lawyer walked me through it step-by-step.My lawyer really cared about me  it was amazing! She heard and understood me and did everything she could to help. In the end, my step-Mom was awarded guardianship and I was able to move in with her. It was great to be able to be with her, someone who loved my Dad and could understand how I felt. We helped each other face the death of my Dad, grieve and move on with our lives.At 15 years old, Victoria had already endured a troubling past. When her mom passed away, she went to live with her father where she was viciously assaulted by her brother. Her father was removed as her guardian and she was sent to live with her aunt and uncle only to suffer sexual abuse by her uncle who later went to prison for his actions.In December 2015, Victoria was finally placed with Tom and Nancy Green and their three children. Things were stable for Victoria and she became a part of the Green family. Then, without warning, Victoria experienced a serious medical issue. Tom and Nancy were not her legal guardians and found themselves helplessly unable to make decisions about her care. In order to be able to make decisions regarding Victorias health and treatment, the Greens decided they needed to become her legal guardians. Victoria was referred to CLERC by the Office of the Child and Youth Advocate in early 2016, after a judge decided that her interests needed to be represented independently as part of the Greens application to obtain legal guardianship.A CLERC lawyer met with Victoria and discussed the situation with her. She expressed that she felt loved and accepted by the Greens and for the first time in her life, finally felt safe and happy. CLERC conveyed Victorias consent to, and desire for, the Greens to become her legal guardians to the Court and the Greens application was successful. Tom and Nancy expressed their gratitude to CLERC for saving Victorias life by helping put an end to the repeated trauma she had endured in the past and giving her the chance at a normal childhood with their three other children who embraced Victoria as a sister and were already developing a healthy and supportive relationship with her.","We Are:We are the only registered charity in Western Canada providing specialized legal support to vulnerable children and youth.

Keiths co-worker was looking for an alternative fundraising opportunity for Childrens Wish. As an active guy, Keith jumped at the chance. It was there that he met Patty, a Wish mum on their team. Despite the cold conditions, Pattys story lit a fire in Keith that warmed his heart. He was inspired.The team has grown more tightly knit since that first year. Keith is one of a core group of 10 people - like Dan Owen of OCL Studios and Jean Hunt of Ski Cellar Snowboard - who row and fundraise every year. They have even attracted former opponents to the team who were Wish parents! To this point, they are nearing the $500,000 total mark. Even in years where the Dragon Boat race was cancelled, Keith and his teammates put on functions at the Red and White Club with help from Dan of OCL Studios to make sure the team hit their fundraising marks.Once he was in, Keith began lending his time to other Wish initiatives. He has taken part in Wish granting events, helping staff deliver the pwoer of joy to a Wish child. He has volunteered at numerous other events like the Holt Renfrew Holiday Shopping Night as well as larger first-party events like the Wishmaker Walk. As he puts it, Anything Childrens Wish needs, Im there. Im pretty sure Im on speed dial now. He has even been honored at our Gala for his outstanding philanthropy.Keith is one of dozens of dedicated volunteers who lend their time to yearly initiatives to grant Wishes. But, like so many of our most dedicated volunteers, Keith believes its a team effort.Theres a group doing all of this. They are there to step up to the plate every time I call. It really wouldnt look as good as it does without all those people.To volunteer like Keith,clickhere. Want to go the extra mile and put on an event?

"110",387,"Chinook Country Historical Society","Imagine a city without public libraries, without parks or a performing arts centre. Who were the driving forces behind making Calgary one of the best places to live? What was their passion? How did this passion and determination change how we live today?Many of the stories of the prominent people who were instrumental in building our city and province are well documented, but what about the lesser known people in our history like William Reader or Annie Davidson? How did they contribute to our culture?Imagine a library without any books? Within the first few days of opening Calgarys first public library in 1912, every single book had been borrowed. Clearly, Calgary was thirsty for knowledge but Annie Davidson already knew that. A 70 year old widow and mother of 10 she understood the value of books and the need for a library in what was a burgeoning city.Annie Davidson moved to Calgary in 1906 to be closer to her children. She brought with her a passion for reading. It didnt take her long to find others who loved to read as well and she soon established the Calgary Womens Literary Club where like-minded ladies would get together to talk about the books they read. However Annie Davidson and the other ladies of the club recognized that most of the books in Calgary were in the private collections of the few people who could afford them. Even the schools have very few of them in their collection. They were determined to make books available to everyone.But getting the first library built wasnt easy. In order to get the library approved, they needed to get 10 percent of the people who were eligible to vote to sign a petition asking city council to build a library. Keep in mind that at this time, women were not allowed to vote, so the ladies had to get the men of the community to agree to build the library. Their first attempt was a unsuccessful as they didnt get enough signatures. Undeterred, they went around knocking on doors a second time and succeeded in getting enough signatures.By 1908, just 2 years after Ms. Davidson arrived, City Council approved the building of the library and on January 2, 1912, it opened its doors to the public. Within a few days, almost 10 percent of the people in Calgary had registered for library cards. Shortly after the library opened, the shelves were totally empty  all 5,200 books that were there on opening day had been borrowed.Unfortunately, Annie Davidson never saw her dream come true. She died at the age of 78 in 1910, before the library opened. Her spirit lives on in the Memorial Park Library, the library that was built as a result of her passion and determination.We strive to make our history relevant to today and the future. We research and tell the inspiring stories of Albertans, including the achievements of Lougheed, Cross, Burns and Edwards, but also the stories of important but less well known individuals such as Davidson and Reader. In literature and presentation, we show how a small number of individuals with a determined spirit and a strong faith in their mission can affect the course of history.The Chinook Country Historical Society is a chapter of the Historical Society of Alberta which was established in 1907 as one of the first acts of the legislature of the newly created province. Embodying the passion of our first Premier, Alexander Cameron Rutherford the act states, The object of the Society shall be to encourage the study of the history of Alberta and Canada, to rescue from oblivion the memories of the original inhabitants, the early missionaries, fur traders, explorers, and settlers of the north and west of Canada, to obtain and preserve narratives in print, manuscript or otherwise of their travels, adventures, labour and observations, to secure and preserve objects generally illustrative of the civil, religious, literary and natural history of the country.","Each year we showcase history of the Calgary region in monthly presentations from September through May and for 11 days during Historic Calgary Week in late July/early August. We present some 75 programs that explore the diverse culture and history of the region.Although CCHS organizes and supports Historic Calgary Week, we work with many other local organizations that have an interest in history. Many of these organizations showcase their specific interest in history as part of our overall program. The vast majority of our programs are open to the public at no cost.This has been a landmark year being the 25th anniversary of Historic Calgary Week. To mark this occasion, we have organized the most comprehensive program yet. In addition to some 60+ regular events, there are several special events including:Calgary Remembered - viewing a video of that examines the spirit that built Calgary and followed up with a panel presentation of the visions for the future;History Hunt - reviving a feature of the original Historic Calgary Week in 1991, participants will have the opportunity to discover hidden history nuggets throughout Calgary;Salute to the Stones of Signal Hill - Take A Pilgrim in this unique centennial commemoration of Sarcee Camp and learn about the sacrifices of our troops in WW I.

This year the HCW festival will be held from July 23 to August 3;Sponsoring books and anthologies that highlight Calgary and Alberta history. Currently, CCHS is in the process of publishing a history book for children aged 8-12 years. The first volume of a two-volume series should be available by December 2015. The book will highlight the stories of the people that resided in and built our province.Membership fees pay for only a small portion of our programs with donations and grants making up the difference. Our programs are organized by committees reporting to the Board of Directors and are comprised of a program committee for the monthly programs, a committee that organizes Historic Calgary Week and a third committee that is sourcing and editing the material for the childrens books.Our efforts are almost entirely volunteer run with support from the Historical Society of Alberta.","As a volunteer-run, non-profit organization, CCHS relies on membership fees and donations for the majority of its funding requirements.

"111",378,"CIVIX Canada","In his early 20s, Taylor Gunn set out to develop a program that would teach kids about voting, foster their connection to the community, and eventually reverse the decline of voter turnout.With a very limited amount of resources and support from education stakeholders, Taylor recruited a small team to build a student engagement model that would secure the participation of hundreds of thousands of students in the first-ever province-wide parallel election program in Canada. On October 2nd 2003, more than 335,000 students took part in the inaugural Student Vote program during the Ontario provincial election.Since then, Student Vote has been brought to the federal level, and to other provincial and municipal jurisdictions across the country. By building extensive partnerships with election offices, school boards, media outlets, community and financial support, Taylor and the CIVIX team are ensuring that our democracy is brought to life in the classrooms and homes of young students across Canada.-----The participation of citizens in the electoral process is a central component of a healthy democracy, yet a marked decline in voter turnout has plagued Canada over the last two decades. Electoral participation reached an all-time low of 59 per cent in the 2008 federal election, and voter turnout in most provinces is hovering at 50 per cent.More concerning is the fact that low voter turnout is disproportionately concentrated among young Canadians. In the 2011 federal election, only 39 per cent of voters were aged 18 to 24, compared to 70 percent of voters aged 55 and older.Research suggests that the habits of voting and non-voting persist over time. If Canadian youth dont vote now, they likely wont become voters later in life. This has serious implications for the future of our democracy.CIVIX exists to give young Canadians a solid base of interest, knowledge and experience to inspire their citizenship. Without it, they will continue to stay away from political participation, public policy and voting.With it, they will guarantee a healthy and robust democracy for Canada.","CIVIX provides experiential learning opportunities to help young Canadians practice their rights and responsibilities as citizens. Rather than study democracy in a textbook, students experience it firsthand with actual events and pertinent issues in real-time.By practicing the habits of informed and engaged citizenship at an early age and nurturing these habits throughout adolescence, students will be able and willing to participate in our democracy when they reach voting age.CIVIX works with educators to deliver programs in elementary and secondary schools across Canada. We offer resources and innovative approaches so that educators can easily and effectively teach democracy and citizenship. Working within the school system allows us to reach all demographics, including those less likely to be engaged in our political system.-----Over the last twelve years, CIVIX has developed a great track record in engaging schools and working with electoral agencies and education stakeholders throughout Canada. Alberta has quickly become one of the most exciting places in the country for us to work. CIVIX has organized Student Vote programs in the last four federal and three provincial elections. Our long-term goal is to reach every school in the province.In the most recent provincial election, more than 92,000 Student Vote ballots were cast from 838 schools, representing the provinces best-ever participation in the program. In major urban centres like Calgary, more than 50 per cent of all schools took part in the program.Already in this falls federal Student Vote, Alberta has shattered its past participation records. The province has increased its best-ever participation by 20 per cent, with 1,061 schools registered  thats more than half of all schools in the province!To recognize the incredible commitment of Calgary teachers to civic education, and to enhance their delivery of Student Vote in advance of the federal election, CIVIX organized a Democracy Bootcamp for more than 300 teachers representing half of the citys schools. Democracy Bootcamp is a professional development conference for elementary and secondary teachers, designed to inspire their own democratic engagement as well as improve their instructional capacity in the areas of government, politics, and civic participation.","Our flagship program, Student Vote, is a parallel election for students under the voting age, coinciding with federal, provincial and municipal elections. Participating students have the opportunity to learn about Canadas government and electoral system, research political parties, discuss relevant issues, and cast ballots in an authentic vote on their local candidates. The Student Vote election results are shared for public broadcast and publication after the official polls close.The Student Budget Consultation offers students a seat at the federal budget table. Participants learn about government revenues and expenditures, debate varying viewpoints and offer their own opinions on the priorities of the federal budget. Their views are captured in a survey and the results are shared with Canadas Minister of Finance.Rep Day connects high school students across the country with their local representatives to encourage dialogue on current issues. The program challenges the stereotypes that young people have of politicians and the political process, aiming to aims to develop a better understanding of, and appreciation for, the people and institutions that comprise our democracy.Democracy Bootcamp is a professional development conference for elementary and secondary school teachers designed to improve their instructional capacity with respect to citizenship and democratic engagement, and enhance their delivery of the Student Vote program. The conferences deliver an inspiring agenda focused on voting trends and research, an insiders look at election campaigns, tools for civic education and best practices for Student Vote.","CIVIX programing is free for students and teachers, and so we rely on external support to fund our efforts.With your generous support, CIVIX will remain independent and innovative as we work to build the next generation of active and engaged citizens, capable of guaranteeing a healthy and robust democracy in Canada for years to come.By making a donation to CIVIX, you will help inspire the engagement of students, teachers and families in communities across the country.

"112",638,"Classroom Champions","Kids have what it takes, sometimes they just need a champion to help them!As a seven-year-old immigrant from Jamaica to Canada, Akeem Haynes quickly learned to be adaptable and comfortable being uncomfortable. Akeem struggled with the temperature change and his mother didnt really have the money for warm clothing, so he missed a lot of school in those first few months in Yellowknife. His mom worked multiple jobs to make ends meet and Akeem only half-jokingly says he raised himself.As a teenager at school in Calgary, Akeem met Steve Mesler, Olympic gold medalist in bobsled, Classroom Champions co-founder, and the organizations first athlete mentor. Steve talked to Akeems class about their futures and how to be accountable for their goals. This is something a growing roster of Olympians and Paralympians now do throughout the school year as part of Classroom Champions structured, technology-based programming delivered in partnership with in-class teachers in underserved communities in Calgary, and across Canada and the U.S.At times, Akeem struggled in school and in his chosen sport of track and field. However, he had a positive and optimistic outlook, an ability to set goals and persevere in achieving them, and he could dream big dreams. With the help of mentors like his coaches, as well as Steve, Akeem built on his strengths. He completed his education and he also won a bronze medal in track and field for Canada at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. Looking back on the tough times he endured, Akeem says he wishes he had Classroom Champions when he was growing up. For him, Classroom Champions teaches kids that nothing is unattainable, and that success is a state of mind. Now one of dozens of Classroom Champions athlete mentors himself, Akeem delivers monthly lessons to students on goal setting, perseverance, fair play, and giving back to community. Having been in a similar situation to so many of his students, he can relate to them and work closely with their teachers to help them build the confidence and the camaraderie he knows they need to succeed both in and out of the classroom.Akeem believes his purpose has always been to be of service to others. Through Classroom Champions, he gets to give back to underserved children across Canada. He also receives a lot in return, both through the training in public speaking and digital communications that he receives through Classroom Champions and through the support of his students. When I went to visit my classrooms, I was having a tough time with the training and mentally sticking with it, he says about his preparation for the Olympics in Rio. Then I go and its like a refresher. They helped re-energize me!Akeem understands that You cant do it alone. You cant choose success alone, and says, Ive had a village of individuals help get me to where I am today. For this athlete mentor, success comes from understanding the impact of your choices on other people as well as yourself, and from making a choice thats going to be beneficial for you and your family. Classroom Champions also believes that building a community of support for the kids who need it most is the right choice to make because through those strong connections everyone succeeds.","Giving kids a champion to help themMany deserving young students in underserved communities face significant barriers to obtaining the critical skills they need for personal, academic and career success. Classroom Champions provides unique mentoring for these students, partnering Olympic and Paralympic athlete mentors with in-class teachers throughout the school year to help students develop essential skills in goal setting, perseverance, fair play, and giving back to community.The results speak for themselves, says one of our teachers, noting her students increased collaboration, empathy for others and newfound leadership skills. This growing sense of community and mutual support is not limited to students. Classroom Champions provides ongoing professional development and networking opportunities for teachers and for our athlete mentors. As leaders in educational thinking around social and emotional learning, we also ensure a bridge in students learning from school to home through our specialized resources for families.Locally, in Calgary, over the past four years, Classroom Champions has been a part of impacting:1,300 local Calgary students and partnered with more than 45 local teachers with the help of over 17 Olympian and Paralympian mentors.Teachers report increased attendance, improved behaviour and grades, and an improved classroom culture among other outcomes for Calgary students.Students have participated in learningabout goal setting, perseverance and, just as importantly, giving back to the Calgary community.Calgary students, through Classroom Champions, have given back to the Veterans Food Bank, Mayors Food Drive, Animal Rescue Foundation, the local chapter of Women in Need Society and the Calgary Humane Society to name a few.Were looking to expand our impact in the Calgary area, please visit our What You Can Do section to see how you can help!Program- wide, over the 2015-16 school year, were pleased to say that weve been a part of impacting:5,100 students in 155 classrooms mentored across 7 Canadian provinces and 23 U.S. states.

Where possible, athlete mentors visit their classrooms in person. When students realize how much their athlete mentors care about them and their futures, a connection unlike any other takes place. The student experience becomes one of excitement and voice as students see their efforts and achievements being recognized and cheered on by someone they look up to outside their immediate circle of family and teacher support.We train and support teachers throughout the yearQuality teachers are key to students success. Classroom Champions partners with teachers in underserved communities, where teacher training, engagement and retention are constant challenges, to provide opportunities for professional development and a feeling of community.Teachers apply to be part of Classroom Champions and vigorously compete each year for a place in the program.

At Classroom Champions, we understand how critical family engagement is to a childs success. As such, we seek to help bridge student learning from school to home through community celebration events, specialized resources, and engaging our Olympian and Paralympian parents.We train and support Canadas Olympians and Paralympians Classroom Champions provides the training and tools athletes need to make the transition from outstanding role models to outstanding mentors who can actively and effectively support students track their own path to success. Through this process, students gain a way to set and achieve successful goals and develop a sense of self-worth. Athlete mentors benefit too, with this type of professional development proving to be a valuable launching pad for athletes beginning to look for career options beyond world-class competition.","Are you ready to help a child dream big and succeed?We believe every child has the right to a champion in their corner who can help them learn the critical skills for success both in and out of the classroom.

They are masters at building a sense of family and belonging for children and families. They are ever-present in building strong and healthy foundations for children and youth. ~ From a family who received services at Closer to HomeMISSION AND VISION Founded in 1995, Closer to Home Community Services (CTH) mission is:Empowering Families to Stay Together. This is the focus of everything we do. Our vision is that CTH contributes to a future where every child will belong to a family and feel valued and secure. Through the use of evidence-based practices and innovative solutions, CTH will strive to preserve, reunify and build stronger families who can care for their children and contribute meaningfully in their community.We provide a broad array of strength-based and family-centered services that teach, coach, and support families to create new possibilities and achieve better futures together.Our services ensure that children have stable, healthy and safe living environments in which to grow and develop. In some cases, when families are separated, we provide a place for children and youth to call home while offering therapeutic support with the ultimate goal of family reunification.BUILDING STRONG FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIESChildren, youth and parents come to us for a variety of reasons. Sometimes parents are struggling to care for a child with a mental, physical or emotional disability, or their child has made choices that have led to an unhealthy lifestyle. Sometimes, the parents are struggling with these issues themselves.We know that being part of a resilient family is the foundation for a childs health, safety and success. By building stronger families, Closer to Home increases family independence and reduces the strain on more costly social supports. HOW WE ARE UNIQUECloser to Home is the only organization of its kind in Canada that integrates the Teaching Family Model into its programs and services (along with other proven service models).The Teaching Family Model is an evidenced-based, internationally-accredited best practice approach to helping create skill-based solutions for families. CTH has been so successful serving its clients and creating positive change that the organization now mentors and consults to other agencies around the world on the implementation of the Teaching Family Model.RESULTS (2015):Since 1995, CTH has grown quickly and expanded services to support children in group care, foster care, family-based and early intervention services; andIn the past 20 years CTH has served over 50,000 individuals.We served 1,635 clients in 2015/16, and 95% of clients are satisfied with our programming; there were 6,899 children in care in Alberta and there are four domains that weve focused on:Child Well-Being: 94% of families in our early intervention/prevention programs reported an increased ability to respond to daily challenges;Safety: 85% of families in our early intervention/prevention programs reported increased knowledge of child development and parenting strategies;Permanence: 88% of children in our Foster Care program returned home or found a permanent home through kinship care or adoption;Family  Community Connections: 100% of our Resource Centre clients reported an increase in friends, family members and others who can provide emotional support and assistance in times of crisis;","SERVICES WE OFFERFamily and Community Support:Early Interventionprograms designed topreventstress, crisis and family breakdown, such as theWest Central Community Resource Centre, which provides walk-in services, parenting/caregiver support and classes, child and youth programs, and more.Preservation:In-Home Family Support programs designed to assist families to recover from crisis or maltreatment, to preserve the family unit and to build new positive skills for the future.

But at Christmastime, the need for extra help became increasingly urgent.We are seeing a real generosity of spirit as Calgarians adopt-a-family and make their Christmas dreams come true, says Karen Olivier, Closer to Homes Chief Executive Officer. Donors  like Calgary Academy, and so many others  are really stepping up to help families with toys, clothes, food and basic necessities that they so badly need.Through Adopt-a-Family, Closer to Home makes a personal connection with families who are struggling to ensure they have the resources and support they need, now and in the future when times get tough.Calgary Lexus Dealers have also partnered with Closer to Home to make a $40,000 minimum donation to support families at Christmastime and throughout the year. A total of $500 from every Lexus sold in Calgary until January 3rd, 2017 will be donated to Closer to Home to strengthen families. Visitwww.lexusholidaylift.comfor more information.Closer to Home increasingly relies on Calgary and Airdrie donors to support the families we serve, says Olivier. The stresses facing many families right now will continue into the New Year, making it critical that we all work together and share our resources, time and energy. We really need the support of the community to keep children and families healthy and strong.Closer to Home has supported and empowered more than 50,000 Albertans since 1995.

"114",705,"Community Kitchen Program of Calgary Society","A call was received at the Community Kitchen Program oneafternoon from a city agency. It proceeded as follows: A mom was leaving a safe house for abusedwomen and children after the police had arrested and charged the personresponsible for the physical abuse causing bodily harm. The mom and herchildren were moving back into their home, it was now a safe place to live.This mom only had $15.00 in her wallet, with no money in a bank account and no meansto receive any assistance.The Community Kitchen Programreceived a call about this family and we immediately made a hamper up for them.This call came in late on a Friday and most of the social agencies that supplyfood were closed. We were quick to provide a hamper to this family that day andwe will continue to supply food to that family food until her governmentassistance kicks in. We believe strongly that no one inCalgary should be without food. The circumstances that this family was in werevery severe and continued help must be available so their lives can get back ontrack with dignity and safety with food security.We teach participants how to preparenutritious meals, budget their finances -- making their income stretch bypreparing cost effective, healthy meals, as well as providing a means to accessnutritious food.By having a teaching component in many of our programs, we empower our clients to a new level that provides them with the opportunity to become more self-sufficient. We believe in a hands up, rather than a hands out, moving the vulnerable closer to living with dignity.Community Kitchen Programs WHY:To ensure Calgarians have an accessible and sustainable food supplyTo address issues of hunger with children, adults, families and seniorsTo respond to needs of Calgarians when in crisis facing hungerTo address homelessness regarding sustainability, leaving transition achieving stabilityTeaching component in many of the programsWe are a hands up agency, to help vulnerable clients dealing with food insecurityTo help clients contribute to their own betterment by participationTo teach good and healthy eating habits, food handling, cooking, nutrition and smart shopping","We operate a self-empowering model to address the needs of marginalizedCalgarians. Weve continually evolved over the years to meet the changing needsof our city, in response to our deepening awareness and understanding of thecomplex issues of poverty and hunger.The programs weve built helpadults, children and families eat healthier, at a lower cost, learning how tocut the grocery bills and, most importantly, how to keep these healthy habitsthroughout their lifetime. Were not just giving a hand-out, but a hand-up!Children are the future, which is why we teach our next generation aboutnutrition, smart grocery shopping, how to read a food label, safety withknives, cross contamination, and even proper etiquette. These children willobtain the information and hopefully keep it with them as they grow,influencing the following generations and in turn, lowering the hungerpopulation in this city.2015 Annual Report Highlights:2,190 volunteers contributed 5,294.5 hours to the Community Kitchen ProgramIntegrated Online Store into the Good Food Box program; now delivering this program to Strathmore, Wheatland Country and Siksika Nation in Gleichen, Alberta.FoodnMore has provided of 512,000 pounds of food to communities over the past year, and we have also expanded this program out to Siksika Nation.Community partnerships thrive when working with Prospect and the Remand Centre. Every Monday at Prospect, we work with and train a group of 10 clients for 8 weeks. We host similar 8-week training programs for 4 different groups of inmates at the Remand Centre and 3 different groups through CMHA Mental Health.The impact of the Good Food Box Program - A testimonial from a senior:We are seniors who receive Alberta benefits, we are so blessed with the food we receive with the Spinz-A-Round program. We love a good variety of things to help us cook and eat much more healthy. Using this program and the Good Food Box where we purchase the large box gives us choice to prepare healthy meals. In our home you dont normally find snack foods. Thank you Marilyn and staff for your efforts and continue to help those on minimum income. It is so much appreciated.~P.R.","Community Kitchen, through its various programs, provides services that are delivered without regard for race, religion, culture, disability or sexual orientation. The Community Kitchen Program believes that hunger transcends all distinctions that society makes about people.There is approximately 7.7% or 70,000 men, women and children in Calgary alone that deal with food insecurity, and Community Kitchen has programs in place that deal with some of these problems, such as lack of good nutritious food, and the preparation and delivery of this this same food to the people through its programs.Some examples of ourCommunity Kitchen Programsare:Good Food Box | The Good Food Box makes top-quality, fresh food available in a way that does not stigmatize people, fosters community development and promotes healthy eating.Small Box:$25, 20-25lbs of fruits and vegetablesMedium Box:$30, 30-35lbs of fruits and vegetablesLarge Box:$35, 40-45lbs of fruits and vegetablesSpinz-A-Round | Spinz Around is a program that rescues food collected from local merchants that may have otherwise been thrown away. Fresh produce, bread and other donations from suppliers, farmers markets and others arrive and are distributed. Multiple organizations come to the Spinz-A-Round section of the warehouse to pick up the food to deliver to families around the city.Calgarys Cooking Program | The Calgarys Cooking program gives people regular opportunities to plan and cook a collection of nutritious and budget-friendly meals they then take home to their own freezers. Individuals can form their own groups, or join existing kitchens (most community kitchens meet monthly). Prior to the cook date, participants get together to plan their menus. Community Kitchens then purchases the ingredients at wholesale prices which allows members to prepare 14 days of meals at a low cost.Souper Stars Program | The Souper Stars Program is a series of ten 70 minute classes, 1 class per week, taught to 30 different classrooms a year. The program is designed to teach children in grades 4 to 6 how to attain a safe and healthy lifestyle. The program covers personal hygiene, basic nutrition, kitchen and food safety, grocery shopping, etiquette, stranger security and vegetable and lunch preparation. Our purpose is to empower children to have confidence in their ability to function safely in a kitchen setting and to inspire them to make healthy food and lifestyle choices.Tummy Tamers Program| The Tummy Tamers program is a summer program providing complementary hot lunches and nutritious snacks for children ages 6-12 at the City of Calgary Park n Play day camp sites. Many children rely on school feeding programs and go hungry during the summer months. Each hot lunch is also complete with a short interactive lesson on health and nutrition.Disaster Response|Community Kitchen Program of Calgary is contacted if there is a disaster in the City of Calgary involving more than 100 people. We then create meals for the disaster response staff in order for them to continue helping victims of the trauma they have just experienced, as well as meals for the evacuees.  We rely on donations and all staff members are called in to prepare the meals.Welcome Home Hampers |The Welcome Home Hampers are designed to help those coming out of transitional housing and homelessness.

"115",485,"CommunityWise","Community is the result of building relationships and sharing resources - it is created by its members, and is the result of making space to get to know each other, to collaborate, to create opportunities and find solutions that work for everyone.Community hubs (like CommunityWise) are an idea that both community and policy-makers agree make sense. Reports, conferences and symposiums have all addressed the many reasons that they do. Across the country and around the world, community hubs have emerged as an important way to meet critical local needs and preserve community assets.The need to address racial discrimination is very real in Calgary, as the city becomes more and more diverse and as the culture here adapts to change. The Youth Centre at CommunityWise serves immigrant, refugee and Indigenous youth ages 12  24 and saw the need to do something about racism many of the youth face. Beltline Youth Centre wanted to put on a community celebration of diversity and inclusion, showcasing the talent of the youth who use the centre and inviting wider community to join in.A great idea! But how is it possible to organize an event on top of all the everyday demands of running a youth centre?? Needs and capacity to meet these needs dont always match up... thankfully community hubs can help!CommunityWise facilitated collaboration, provided space and secured funding for two CommunityWise member organizations, Beltline Youth Centre and Aboriginal Friendship Centre, to put on a special event for the International Day to End Racial Discrimination.The Youth Centre came to CommunityWise to collaborate on the event because we had announced our interest in collaborating with members. We were delighted and spread the word to other member groups immediately. The Aboriginal Friendship Centre, another member group with offices at CommunityWise has been collaborating regularly with us and was interested in supporting the Anti-Racism Day event.Suddenly in only three weeks time, we were organizing a big community event together! What better way to acknowledge and address racial discrimination than to work with diverse communities and all ages towards a shared goal? What better way to come together than in a fun, celebratory and educational event?The event attracted around 100 children, youth and adults, which happens to be the maximum capacity of the main common room! People were spilling out of the building into the yard. Attendees enjoyed a free meal sponsored by our local City Council Ward, funding secured by CommunityWise staff. CommunityWise board members came out to the event, as did representatives from other organizations in the building. Children and youth from Calgary After School programs and from the Youth Centre had opportunities to perform and share their experiences through hip hop and spoken word. The audience made up of a diverse range of CommunityWise members, educated each other on the issue of racism from the perspective of youth and through stories shared by Aboriginal Friendship Centre representatives.Recognizing the need, collaborating with members and providing the space, CommunityWise had a vital role in this unique and transformative event. Member groups were empowered to find relevant responses to complex social problems.Together we created the space for community to thrive.-----Community Wise exists:To meet critical local needs and preserve community assets.To bring services and resources together to better serve Calgarians.To build the capacity of smaller nonprofits and foster their success.To help break down the often stubborn territorial pride that keeps groups from working together.To help build bridges between various players, from arts and culture, social and environmental justice, immigration and settlement, support groups, youth services, and poverty reduction.","At CommunityWise we offer more than just subsidized office space - we build the capacity of non-profit organizations by creating opportunities that facilitate increased knowledge, skills, efficiency, opportunity and effectiveness for our members by activating their collective skills and capacity.Community hubs (like Community Wise) are an idea that both community and policy-makers agree make sense.

"116",529,"Confederation Park 55+ Activity Centre","It was definitely a heart warming experience to see so many people working together to provide a wonderful, caring  happy gathering for so many older adults. - Pat FawcettPats thank you note after a special event encapsulates so much of what were all about. Confederation Park 55+ Activity Centre provides a place for seniors to stay active and involved, but its the staff, volunteers and members who all work together to provide a fun, friendly and welcoming place to be.","Staying active and involved isnt all fun and games...except when it really is.   Were serious about promoting a fun and lively atmosphere because we take the health and wellbeing of seniors seriously. Remaining (or becoming) mentally, physically and socially active is one of the best ways for older adults to combat chronic diseases associated with aging and maintain their independence.Our Mission is to Enhancethe Lives of Adults.Fulfilling a Vision: Since 1973, Confederation Park 55+ Activity Centre has been responding to the needs of older adults by connecting them with opportunities for social interaction, education, and volunteerism through clubs, classes and activities. Everything we do is designed to promote mental and physical well-being  and to have fun while were doing it.Accomplishments:We now boast over 650 members with a volunteer base of about 25.There are 40 plus classes offered throughout the year, as well as numerous special events, dances, club activities and seminars.Facility rentals increased our revenues,non-viable classes were cancelled, fundraising events were more lucrative, and expensesstreamlined.We entered into a new funding agreement with Family and Community Support Services (FCSS) to receive support funding from January 2014 through December 2016.","Clubs  Classes -There are a myriad of ways to stay active at Confederation Park 55+ Activity Centre. Whether its through dance, art, cards or singing we offer clubs and classes for people of all skill and activity levels.Events  Outreach -We host a number of special events including a weekly outreach program for local isolated seniors called Tea  Conversation. For many of the participants, its their only opportunity to get out and interact socially during the week.Services -A Boutique and Next-to-New Shop provide gifts and gently used clothes at low prices, our Kitchen volunteers prepare light lunches, the Travel Desk volunteers plan excursions, and regularly scheduled visits from Professional Services (lawyer and podiatrist) all of which benefit seniors in our community.-----Funding continues to be very challenging. We are facing increased costs for utilities,salaries, supplies and programs. In 2014 FCSS agreed to 3 years of continued funding,but at the same time the opportunity for funding from casinos has been reduced to once every 2 years instead of annually.Our greatest challenge is to secure funds for our Tea and Conversation Program (TC). Every Thursday, over 130 seniors attend the event, and we provide transportation for up to 45 isolated seniors in the area to ensure they have an opportunity to connect with others. Live music, dancing, snacks and lively conversation help keep this vulnerable population active and engaged. Our Board recognizes the substantial benefits of the program to seniors living in isolation and is dedicated to keeping TC active, even though the $45,000/year cost is substantial for our organization. Unfortunately, we have been unable to find adequate sponsorship for this life-changing program and with casino funds no longer coming annualy, it has becomecritical to find an alternative solution.","Unfortunately, as Calgary grows and ourpopulation matures, so too, do thenumber of isolated or shut-in seniors. These are people who, for any number ofreasons have become socially isolated. Often times, they may be living alone andstruggling on low/fixed incomes.Theircareer years have long since passed andtheir perceived purpose to participate inthe community has dwindled. They mayhave health and/or mobility issues,making it difficult for them to get out andinteract with the community. Many are lonely, widowed and separated from the younger members of their extended families.This is a deeply valuable, knowledgeable and experienced generation  an intrinsically important segment of our community  sadly forgotten.There are so many ways to get involved. We welcome contributions of:Time: Wed be lost without our volunteers. Over 300 active volunteers keep us functioning and vibrant, but we can always use extra hands - especially when it comes to special events like our Sasi Jaunt.Expertise: Our full-time staff of 3 are impressively talented, but dont always have the time or skills to do some of the things wed love to do. Right now, we have some creative projects on the back burner, and are looking for a videographer and/or crowdfunding specialist to help cook em up.Funds: We can always put extra dollars to good use.

"117",321," Deaf & Hear Alberta (formerly Deaf & Hard of Hearing Services)","Barriers to communication have a direct and measureable impact on learning, employment prospects, relationships, social inclusion, safety and mental health.90 percent of all Deaf children are born to two hearing parents. Deaf children are not having their communication needs met in early childhood or in the classroom. Thats why Deaf  Hear Alberta is implementing a new program that gives Deaf children a boost in the early stages of their life to acquire language skills in their first language of American Sign Language.A Deaf student finishing high school typically graduates from Grade 12 with a Grade 3-4 reading level. Deaf  Hear Alberta puts trained tutors in the classroom to work one-on-one with struggling Grade 1 and 2 students to improve their English comprehension, literacy skills and therefore their future prospects.Deaf  Hear AlbertasInterpreting Servicesprovides almost 7000 hours of interpreting annually to facilitate communication between Deaf users of American Sign Language and hearing audiences. Our roster of over 70 highly skilled ASL-English interpreters provide communication access to Albertas Deaf community.OurAccessibility Servicesdepartment ensures that Deaf individuals remain safe in their homes and are able to lead productive lives with signaling equipment, warning detectors, and personal alerting systems.Almost one in four Canadians has a hearing loss. That translates to almost 250,000 Calgarians. Research by audiologists indicates that it takes someone who is losing their hearing 5 to 7 years to admit they have a hearing loss and then do something about it. Once fitted with hearing aids, 15  18 percent of people never wear them, receiving no benefit from their sizable investment.To address these issues, Deaf  Hear Alberta has launched a new education series calledSound Advice. This series alleviates the fear of hearing loss, demystifies all the options for hearing aids, helps participants develop realistic expectations about their hearing health, provides new skills in reading visual cues like lip-reading, and offers an in-depth program in brain retraining.Children and youth are the fastest growing demographic at risk for hearing loss, with an estimated one in five already having some hearing damage, in large part resulting from excessive volume from personal music players, concerts, etc. Thanks to The Calgary Foundation, we are able to work with junior high school students to develop a compelling message that will convince children and youth toPractice Safe Sound!When someone cannot hear well enough to communicate, the individual is at risk of withdrawing from the world around them. People with hearing loss at any age may be affected, but elderly seniors are most at risk of social isolation. When the lack of hearing inhibits brain functioning, a higher risk of the onset of dementia is the result. Severe hearing loss is also linked to depression, anxiety and paranoia. Deaf  Hear Alberta is developing a core of trained volunteers with ourPeer-to-Hearprogram to provide companionship, counselling, mentoring and support to those hard of hearing persons at risk of social isolation, therefore reducing the risks for mental health issues.Through the assistive technology available from our Accessibility Services Department, hard of hearing persons are able to remain safe in their homes, communicate with their loved ones, retain their social connections and fully participate in their community.","Our client groups are distinct and different. The Deaf community is a unique cultural group united by shared history, stories and visual language  American Sign Language. Those who are born deaf or lose their hearing in early childhood (before they learn spoken language) make up about 0.1 percent of the population. The culturally Deaf base their identity on their use of American Sign Language. Those who are late-deafened, or lose their hearing later in life, brings this sector to about one percent of the population.People may lose their hearing at any time in their lives, but aging and noise-induced hearing loss are the two main causes. Severity of hearing loss may range from mild to profound. The hard of hearings primary mode of communication is verbal.Recognizing these fundamental differences in modes of communication is what forms the foundation of our work. Programs and services within Deaf Services are targeted to the Deaf community or those who want to learn how to communicate with the Deaf community; and programs and services within Hearing Services are targeted to those with a hearing loss or at risk of losing their hearing.OURMISSION| We enhance the lives of Deaf, deafened, and hard of hearing persons by removing barriers and building bridges to communication.OUR VISION | We are working toward a world free of communication barriers for the Deaf, deafened, and hard of hearing.OUR IMPACT | Hearing loss affects 23% of adult Canadians; we serve 38,000 deaf and deafened Albertans.OUR RESULTS | 2016:Continued renovations with new fish bowl office, accessible washroom doors and an extraordinary kitchen makeover;Launched Peer-To-Hear Pilot program with 9 mentee/mentor matches who met once a week for three months;Launched Sound Advice Program to provide more opportunities for people with hearing loss to learn and share information (e.g., Book Club, Colouring Night, Speaker Series...);Launched three-month Emergency Pilot to enable faster response times towards unmet emergency requests;Developed Extraordinary Technology to provide more service in small town Alberta via Skype, Facetime and Telehealth where deaf Albertans contacted us for help with their medical, legal and other types of appointments.","Established in 1961, the Deaf and Hear Alberta has been breaking down barriers to communication for over 50 years. Our work is organized into two distinct program streams: Deaf Services and Hearing Services.Deaf Services:Interpreting Services:provides some of the most qualified ASL interpreters in the province to facilitate communication between Deaf users of ASL and hearing audiences.American Sign Language training:we offer a range of courses for the public, families and workplaces.Student Literacy:qualified tutors provide learning assistance to elementary school children.Counselling: a qualified psychologist provides counselling services and mental health supports in American Sign Language to Deaf and hard of hearing individuals, children and families.Deaf Services: support, counselling and advocacy on behalf of individuals and families.Hearing Services:Hearing Loss Prevention:bringing awareness and education about noise-induced hearing loss.Sound Advices series:a series of courses on the care and management of hearing loss and how to mitigate its adverse effectsPeer to Hear: matching trained volunteers with a hard of hearing person at risk of social isolation for counselling, mentoring and support.Equipment:Assistive listening and signaling devices for the Deaf or hard of hearingScholarship:Deaf and Hear Alberta is pleased to introduce theTom Pinder Educational Scholarshipin 2014.

"118",131,"Dancers' Studio West Society (DSW)","Dance moves us. DSW invites you to embrace this spirit: to react, question, feel, share and respond, to engage in the dance. We invite you to truly experience performance, to be affected each time you come to the theatre.DSW  never leave unchangedI have attended lots of performances presented by DSW over the past 5 years and in that time I have witnessed many positive developments in both the dancers and the presentations. At DSW performances I am drawn irresistibly into the world of the dance through the enhanced strengths and focused intent of the dancers. I really enjoy watching the development of the young choreographers as they show their works at the beginning and then at the end of mentored workshops. Consistent hard work in the creative process has obviously translated into aesthetically rewarding performances for the dancers and for me as an audience member. As a life-long eclectic arts-lover I have seen that every art form needs individuals or organizations with the vision to expand the frontiers of that form. DSW must be commended and celebrated for doing that in Calgary.Audience Member: Sondra Corff, PHD., life-long eclectic arts-loverDSW is the only organization in Calgary that offers consistent professional development programs for dance professionals in contemporary dance, so I value it greatly. It is a forum where community building takes place, every experience offered by DSW helps me to connect with other artists in the community (from dance or other genres), as well as with artists outside the community. It helps me to feel a part of something greater than myself. It has always served as an important conduit for the vital transition of being a student/ emerging artist and entering phases of development that lead to becoming an established and more accomplished artist in the professional community locally and nationally. Without DSW I would not have been able to accomplish as much as I have in my professional career.Participant Artist: Helen Husak, Lieutenant Governors Award WinnerI consider my varied experiences at DSW to be invaluable, there is no comparable programming available to me as a dance artist in Calgary. In 2014 I became a member of the Dance Action Group, I was mentored in a choreographic process by Davida Monk, Ive taken morning classes through DSW, attended performances, discussed work at talk backs and at the undressing the dance series, and worked as an outside eye for the Alberta Dance Festival. These experiences have developed my technique, my choreographic eye and improved my ability to communicate verbally about the art Im creating and viewing. Most importantly DSW has given me the chance to share my experience with other artists, be influenced by their unique perspectives and connect with artists I havent worked with in the past. The most significant positive aspect of my experience with DSW is constant learning and growth. Each experience at DSW is a tool that fuels me as an artist and challenges my perspective allowing me continue to develop.Participant Artist: Catherine HaywardWhat about Dancers Studio West?I have been a practitioner, advocate and champion of Calgarys arts since early 1980. During that time I have seen the remarkable growth and vitality of Calgarys artists contribute to the quality, character and economy of our City. It makes me proud. But while other genres of arts practice have shown resilience, dance continues to lag behind its colleagues in Calgary and the Province. Dancers and dance companies seem isolated. Taken individually, the diverse work of our dance artists excels artistically, but contemporary dance has yet to take its place in the arts lexicon in the same way as theatre, music, film, and visual art. This situation became clearly evident to me while I was Managing Director at Calgary Arts Development. It was during that time that I became more acutely aware of the work being done at Dancers Studio West under the artistic leadership of Davida Monk. I had a few occasions to have in-depth conversations with Davida about the state of contemporary dance. I was impressed by the clarity of vision on behalf of both DSW and the contemporary dance community as a whole. With the courage and energy of the organization and with Davidas leadership, Dancers Studio West is building a vision that contains the promise of propelling contemporary dance to its deserving place in the cultural life of our community. It is for this reason that I am proudly serving on the Board of Directors for Dancers Studio West.Board of Director: Tom McCarthy","In the 2014-15 season, DSW launched the Dance Action Group (DAG). DAG is a small ensemble of aesthetically diverse performer/choreographers under the direction of Artistic Director Davida Monk, committed to, and experienced in, DSWs approach to artistic rigour and critical dialogue. In addition to forming the artistic core of the Dance Action Lab, the members of the Dance Action Group co-operate to fulfill opportunities for community development and organizational support. Throughout the season, the members of DAG will be active in organizing and leading of Critical Dialogue Series, in co-curating and co-hosting of community work in local studios, and in offering outside eye services.Dancers Studio West Society Season:Undressing the Dance Dialogues- Between September and March, DAG members animate a series of six public discussions of specific works seen in Calgary, or selected topics of dance aesthetics and creative practice.Annual Alberta Dance Festival(September): DSWs annual favourite, the two-weekend festival features fresh contemporary dance created by Alberta choreographers.The artistic purpose of the Annual Alberta Dance Festival is to provide a range of aesthetically diverse choreographers, including emerging artists, with creation and performance opportunities; to integrate the outside eye services of DAG in the development of the work; to engage the public in discussions around the work, and to build artistic relationships among artists of all levels of experience. The Festival productions are very popular with our contemporary dance audiences.Cross Fertilization Informal Co-Presentations (February): In collaboration with the Artistic Director of a local dance studio, members of DAG engage in a month long outside eye process that culminates in two evenings of in-studio showings and conversations between dance artists of different levels of experience and different aesthetics. The aim to this program is to build critical facility among the youngest creators in all dance disciplines and to stimulate interest among these young artists in further artistic development and in DSW opportunities.Dance Action Lab (June) The Dance Action Lab is a model of complete professional engagement and is highly rewarding for the artists and audiences. The Dance Action Lab provides 10-week contracts for a company of eight dancer/choreographers The Dance Action Group. The Lab focuses on choreographic responsiveness and productivity, accelerated mentorship, sustained professional experiences, and the development of artistic critical facility and articulateness. The Dance Action Lab provides a much needed professional opportunity, brings the creative process to audiences in public presentations, stimulates discussion about dance making and seeds work destined for presentation opportunities beyond Calgary, including the Prairie Dance Circuit. Two dancers supported by the Royal Bank of Canada Emerging Artists Award program will complement the artistic core. Additional members of the community may be engaged by DAG to participate as dancers, may make application to the Dance Action Group, or apply to the Young Artist Exchange program.Classes and Workshops(September and April - June): Lead by Artistic Direcor, Davida Monk, classes emphasis choreographic sensibilities, musicality, expression and performance.Outside Eye Service Throughout the year, DAG members offer a free outside eye service to interested choreographers.","FOR ARTISTSDSW emphasizes the quality of the creative process and invests in the growth and development of contemporary artists through residency programs, classes, and critical dialogue.ClassesThis somatic, easeful approach is open to all levels of experience and fitness levels. All paid events can be pre-purchased online in advance, or you can drop in and register at the door at the time.Critical Dialogue This Series promotes deep consideration, dialogue, thought, articulation, and questioning of artistic practice in a unique system, centred around the creator. This process immerses the choreographer in another side of the creative process with the opportunity to talk about the work in three primary areas of exchange: 1) mentorship; 2) facilitation; and 3) audience engagement.Outside Eye Services because sometimes you just need some fresh eyes.

"119",795,"Dare to Care Bully Prevention & Life Skills Inc.","We often realize that we are in the right place at absolutely the right time. Last week was one of those times. We were working with a small rural school and met a young boy named Paul. Initially Paul sat off to the side of the school-wide assembly, seemingly bored and un-engaged. We assumed he was off in his own world, perhaps daydreaming about lunchtime or what he was going to do after school. But during the first break, Paul quietly approached us, with tears in his eyes, and simply said I have been bullied for 3 years and no-one in this school cares. He proceeded to tell us about the numerous times he went home hungry because people stole his lunch, and that he had never wanted a birthday party because he knew that no one would come. He had several other stories to share but then he dropped the real bombshell. A week earlier he had gone out to the family shed and held his dads shotgun in his mouth, ready to pull the trigger. He was worn down and tired of the living nightmare his life had become. He simply wanted to give up. Thankfully, he didnt pull the trigger that day. We did not ask him why...we simply hugged him and told him how happy we were that he was here with us. We promised him that if he stayed the day, he would realize that there is hope and that he is not alone in this world. Paul was in Grade 6. Just a young boy growing up in a not-so-perfect world. Imagine if he had gone through with his intentions. Imagine the impact it would have had on his family and his community.What happened later that afternoon is exactly why we continue to do what we do at Dare to Care. Paul, who had felt like giving up only days before, was now surrounded by 15 -20 of his classmates. They were hugging and crying and individually apologizing for what they had done to him. I think youd agree that Pauls life changed that day. The sad reality is that there are 150,000 Pauls in this country. What if one of these children was your own child, and you had no idea? Would you want someone to be there for them?","NO CHILD should ever feel alone, afraid, or unwelcome in their school or community.Bullying is not just a school issue. Bullying is a societal issue that is impacting individuals in all areas of school, community, sports, work and home life and we all play a role in making sure our world is more accepting and kind. Dare to Care was the first fully comprehensive program launched in Canada in 1998 to tackle the pervasive and crippling issue of bullying and mental health amongst our children and youth. Our belief is that all children and youth have a right to feel safe, welcome, and included in their school and community. Dare to Care consists of three programs:Innovative and age appropriate workshops for students, athletes, and sports teams.Support and education for parents to recognize the signs of bullying and mental illnessExtensive Professional Development for teachers, administration,coaches, and officialsBecause of bullying:150,000 Canadian students miss school each day7 out of 10 children quit organized sport by age 1353% of teachers who quit state its because they feel ill-equipped to deal with bullying and other challenging   behaviors in their classroom.Our 2015-16 Results:Impacted over 75,000 students, parents and teachers last yearExpanding into Calgary amateur sports in the September 2017Received the 2016 Government of Alberta Inspiration Award for Leadership in Bully Prevention in schools and communities","The Dare to Care program is designed to assist schools and community groups in establishing inclusive and safe environments where everyone has a sense of social responsibility. Since 1998, Dare to Care has delivered three flagship programs:1) Age-appropriate workshops for students/athletes/sports teams: Through developmentally appropirate assemblies and skill development, children and youth are given the knowledgfe and skill set to collectivley make a difference in their lives and the lives of others. The Dare to Care Student Day emphasizes the important concepts of awareness, empathy, resilience and social responsibility.2) Parent Information Sessions: Including the parents within the school and sporting community is integral in the success of the Dare to Care program.  Parents attend a 2.5 hour information session that will provide them with the awareness and skills to be able to help their children negotiate the sometimes difficult and confusing social world. As well, the session will focus on the self-monitoring of the parents own behavior when in school or at a sporting event.3) Professional Development for Teachers/ Administrators/Coaches/Officials: Teachers, administrators , and coaches play a critical role in creating a climate of support and empathy inside and outside of their classroom or sporting team, yet over the past 17 years we have heard the same feedback repeatedly from educators and coaches....they feel very ill-equipped to effectively deal with bullying. Professional development provides the tools and support needed to implement policies and strategies to prevent and intervene in bullying.Many bully prevention programs have come and gone without having any significant impact on the culture of the school or community. The reason is simple, if we dont mobilize the silent majority or bystanders, nothing will ever change. The silent majority/bystanders are the untapped resource in every school and community. These are the students, players, parents, teachers, etc., who witness the bullying but feel too afraid or ill-equipped to intervene. Through age-appropriate workshops for children and youth; through education and support for parents; and through extensive professional development for teachers, coaches, youth leaders, etc., the Dare to Care program is helping to shift the imbalance of power away from the few who bully and into the hands of the caring majority. For a detailed look at the various Dare to Care programs click see our Information Package for schools.","Schools and Sporting organizations cannot effectively deal with the pervasive issue of bullying without significant support from outside resources.Dare to Cares ability to work with schools and sporting organizations is impaired only by budgetary constraints.

"121",541,"Discovery House Family Violence Prevention Society","Susan came to Discovery House, like many mothers we support, with a heartbreaking and complicated story. After surviving an abusive relationship for years, she reached out for help to overcome her addictions and be reunited with her two young children. The addiction was a direct consequence of the abuse, and she had asked her mother to look after her children during the recovery period.But leaving an abusive relationship is a process, not an event, and Susan wanted support to start a different kind of life for her and her family. With the Discovery House team and Child and Family Services, she created a service plan that included safe housing at Discovery House and counseling supports so she could be with her family again.It was not an easy transition for this young family and Susan struggled with being a full-time parent. For years, her abuser had called her ugly, worthless, and a waste of space. She had no self-esteem, felt incapable of succeeding in anything and thought she was a bad parent. The abusive relationship took a toll on her children, who were often emotional and confused.Now that the family was together, each individual was paired with a Case Manager and able to receive one-on-one support. Susan and her children all started to feel safer and free to plan for a stable future. Susan registered both kids in kindergarten. She set personal goals and even got accepted into a local college program.Of course, there were setbacks along the way, but Susan had new tools at her disposal to work through them. The Discovery House team works hard to empower women to take back control of their lives and build a new future free from abuse. With the support of the case managers, this young mother started to believe in herself again and the children got their Mom back, a little bit healthier and happier.","Leaving an abusive partner is the most dangerous time for women and children who have lived through ongoing abuse. Given the high risk, it is essential that these families have a safe place to stay, heal, and start to plan for a new future.Founded in 1980, Discovery House was the first long-term womens shelter in Calgary. Over the years, we have grown to support 120 families at any given time, all on their journey to living free from domestic abuse. We strive to make our communities free of family violence by providing integrated residential and community services for abused women and children to enable them to live safely in the community.Women with children leaving physical, emotional, financial, sexual or spiritual abuse all receive one-on-one support from trained Case Managers. Together, they determine what their unique goals and priorities are, be that improving parenting skills, finding housing, budgeting and financial assistance, gaining employment, going back to school or legal support.Calgary has one of the highest rates of domestic abuse in Canada. The Calgary Police Service received nearly 16,500 domestic dispute calls in 2013 and nearly 3,000 of those calls resulted in pressing charges against the abusers. This, coupled with low vacancies and high rents means that there is a very real need in Calgary for long-term supports.","Discovery House Family Violence Prevention Society is comprised of two main programs; the Shelter Program and the Community Housing Program. Teams work with families to obtain housing, fulfill basic needs, and navigate the financial and legal support systems with an emphasis on safety, healthy relationships, and housing stability.The Discovery House building is home to the Shelter Program. It has 19 apartments and 24-hour security personnel who oversee a state-of-the-art surveillance system. Families are welcome to stay for up to one year, during which time clients and staff work together to connect to services in the community or take advantage of in-house workshops and assistance. Outreach programs continue with each family for one year after leaving the shelter. The team includes Adult Case Managers, Child and Youth Case Managers, Child and Youth Development Workers, a Family Support Worker and a network of peers.Domestic violence has no boundaries, and the Community Housing Program strives to serve all women and children in need. Keeping that in mind, the Community Housing Program uses the Housing First model to support 100 families affected by abuse in long-term, stable market rental housing. The model has a strong history of success in housing the homeless population, but Discovery House was the first in Canada to apply it to situations of domestic abuse. In the Community Housing Program, families receive support from their Case Manager, a Mental Health Specialist, a Child and Youth Support Specialist and a Housing Liaison. Families are welcome in the program for up to two years. All of our services are individualized and voluntary, so families can access as much or as little support as they desire to accomplish their goals.","As a charitable non-profit, we depend on support from the community to service families in need.DonateThere are 120 families supported by Discovery House at this very moment. Help us continue to provide quality support and services to every single mother and child.For $20,000, you can support one family for one year.FundraiseThere are so many ways to engage your community in supporting families in need. Here weve listed just a few: lemonade stand, garage sale, bake sale, guess the baby challenge, walk-a-thon, donations in lieu of birthday gifts, etc.Purple Heart GalaEvery November, Discovery House hosts a Purple Heart Gala fundraiser with delicious food, entertainment and a persuasive silent auction.VolunteerWe are always looking for volunteers to help on a variety of projects like delivering food to the shelter, gardeningor tutoring math.Wish ListMany mothers and children arrive at Discovery House with very few belongings. These basic needs items are always in demand.","discoveryhouse.ca","JMasikewich@discoveryhouse.ca","118823483RR0001","403.204.6080","Jenny Masikewich","5000000","women famili abus counsel",121,0.0285423037716616,0.0101936799184506,0.0224260958205912,0.0407747196738022,0.0254841997961264,0.0163098878695209,0.0407747196738022,0.0163098878695209,0.208970438328236,0.0163098878695209,0.0316004077471967,0.319062181447503,0.0132517838939857,0.0163098878695209,0.193679918450561

In 1977, The Drug Information Centre changed its name to Distress Centre/Drug Centre and was accepted as a member of the United Way. In 1980, Distress Centre launched Canadas first peer-to-peer youth crisis program  the teen line, which was later renamed ConnecTeen.In 1999, Distress Centre continued to experience tremendous growth as we introduced several new programs and partnerships including the Mobile Response Team. In 2005, Distress Centre, along with the City of Calgary and United Way, launched 211. This further established Distress Centre as the hub of crisis support and the go-to place for community referrals in Calgary.

Cloistered in the Forest Lawn bedroom of his friend Keira, he starts a live video for his loyal followers who know him from his lip-sync performances as rihannaboi95. As you watch on your computer or phone, Sunny spills his heart out to you, talking, dancing and crying as he works through the events of the last few days.rihannaboi95 was a play by Canadian writer Jordan Tannahill that was performed live by a solo actor in a bedroom and livestreamed to viewers in Calgary as well as across Canada and several international locations. Dealing candidly with bullying, identity and the pain of self-invention, the show offered viewers an intensely empathetic first-person account of a queer teens experience at a time when Gay-Straight Alliances were becoming an increasingly polarized issue in Alberta.During and after the show, audience members had access to an anonymous chat. Teen viewers connected openly with adults their parents age about navigating their sexual and gender identities and the challenges they faced within their high schools  a powerful bridge between experiences made possible through a great piece of art.","Founded in 2004,Downstageis a Calgary-based organization dedicated to producingCanadian theatre that creates conversation around social issues.With a focus on new work created by local artists, we offer artistic experiences that are entertaining, inventive, thought-provoking and highly relevant to your everyday life.All of our performances are followed by a moderated post-show discussion where audience members can engage with each other about the ideas provoked by our shows. This post-show engagement coupled with a commitment to attracting an audience that mirrors the diversity of our city helps to create opportunities for social bridging: allowing people to form connections to others who are different from them, whether in terms of age, culture, life experience, profession or ability.Our plays serve as a touchstone for conversation, inspiring a seniors life-long learning group to have a spirited debate with teenagers about our public education system after a performance of Bashir Lazhar, or ranchers and landmen to connect over shared challenges around land use during the run of Good Fences.","We support the creation of exceptional new plays about local issues. We work with local creators and playwrights, often over the course of several years, to develop and premiere new plays that speak to issues of concern to Calgarians through entertaining and inventive theatre. Past works have tackled a range of complex and challenging topics including consumer debt, geo-engineering, the relationship between the energy industry and ranching, genetic testing, eco-anxiety, ethical dilemmas around the charitable model, and the impact of violent art on society.In the last eight years, weve developed and produced seven World Premieres, all by Albertan writers, with a strong response from audience members and critics alike. Six of these shows were nominated for a Betty Mitchell Award for Outstanding New Play, with two receiving the award, and many going on to future productions, touring and publication.We find innovative ways to remove barriers to attending live theatre. We have an insatiable desire to make theatre more relevant and accessible to a wide range of Calgarians, with initiatives like tours to suburban and rural community halls, livestreaming performances online, and our ongoing Pay-It-Forward program which offers 25% of all tickets at no cost on a first-come, first-serve basis. We recently partnered with Inside Out Theatre to offer our first relaxed performance for audience members with sensory processing concerns, a partnership that will continue in 2017-18 with a relaxed performance and two ASL-interpreted performances.We contribute towards a healthy local theatre community. We curate the Motel Theatrein Arts Commons, one of the most affordable theatrical venues in the city that is a first home for many emerging and experimental groups.

Behind the scenes, wetlandsare working for the environment, providing a host of benefits we cant live without. This includes cleanwater to drink, flood protection for communities and healthy lakes and rivers. But the real power of wetlands is how they inspire people.

Flooding and drought are devastating realities for people living in the Prairies. Albertans know all too well the impacts these events can have on communities, livelihoods and the environment. The Government of Alberta has created a new Watershed Resiliency and Restoration Program to combat the impacts of these extreme weather events  and DUC is poised to lend a helping hand.The program provides grants to municipalities and organizationsfor projects that enhance watersheds resiliency to the impacts offlooding and drought. DUC submitted a proposal requesting $11.6million for a three-year period to conserve and restore wetlandson 1,380 acres (558 hectares) in flood and drought-prone areas ofsouth central and southern Alberta.In Alberta, conserving habitat that benefits waterfowl, other wildlife and communities across theprovince requires strong partnerships and a vision for the future. Our work with the provincialgovernment and the success of our education programs are two highlights from the past year thatare moving us closer to our conservation goals.The Institute for Wetland and Waterfowl Research (IWWR) provides scientific research for DUC. Its respected team of biologists finds answers to important environmental questions and establishes the value of wetlands to society.DUC delivers the Project Webfoot education program to thousands of students and teachers annually and partners with interpretive centres where the public explores and learns about wetlands firsthand.DUC works with all levels of governments, advocating for programs and policies that benefit wetlands and stop critical wetland loss.","As a science-based conservation organization, we have our own dedicated team ofexperienced scientists fromTheInstitute for Wetland and Waterfowl Research (IWWR).They find answers to important environmental questions and establish the value of wetlands to waterfowl and society. Our sciencehelps guide our various conservation programs.Habitat Retentionprograms secure habitat for the long term. This include the acquisition of land, conservation easements and agreements, and the implementation of best management practices (BMPs) to retain productive capacity of the landscape.footerWetland Restorationprograms involve the restoration or enhancement of degraded or drained wetlands through the restoration of hydrological or ecological function. We restore wetlands by simply plugging drainage ditches, or through more elaborate measures involving dykes, dams and engineered water control structures.Government and Industry Relationsprograms support all conservation programs. This includes working with various levels of government (federal, provincial, municipal, etc) and industry to change behavior or land use to meet conservation objectives. Examples include advancing effective provincial wetland policies or helping designate protected areas in the boreal forest.Landowner Relationsprograms provide support to the thousands of dedicated landowners across Canada that we partner with in delivering on-the-ground conservation efforts. Together with landowners, we develop practices that benefit both them and the environment.Upland Restorationprograms restore upland areas around wetlands to a condition that better supports nesting waterfowl. This is done through the conversion of annual cropland to grassland (including hayland, pastures and areas managed specifically for nesting waterfowl), and by encouraging farmers to adopt winter wheat into their annual cropping practices.Habitat Asset Managementprograms maintain the condition of habitats (both upland and wetland) that we retain and restore.","Do you want to know more about DUC?

"125",140,"Easter Seals Alberta Society","Im accepted for who I am. I cry every time I leave because what happens at Camp doesnt happen anywhere else -Daniel, Camper at Easter Seals Camp HorizonOne day my worst fear was realized. My wheelchair stalled in the middle of one of the busiest intersections in Calgary.- Dermott, Client of Equipment and Support Services programThis is why we exist. To serve the needs of Albertans regardless of age, gender or disability. Over the past 63 years we have grown, adapted and worked hard to make a difference for all Albertans and their families by providing direct services, financial assistance, a summer camp and an equipment program. We also provide public education, research and advocacy in the province of Alberta.For Daniel, being at Easter Seals Camp Horizon has changed him and the way he sees life. He is more confident and realizes that he still has a lot of ability even if he has a disability. For Dermott, receiving his new wheelchair through Easter Seals Alberta after his old one left him helpless allowed him to leave the house with confidence again. As a senior, being part of the community he helped build is important.The history of what is now the Easter Seals Alberta Society begins in 1951 and has reflected the needs of the times. As new disability related organizations formed and others folded, and government policy and activities changed, our organization maintained a focus on the needs of Albertans with physical disabilities. In 1951, motivated by the polio epidemic sweeping the continent, Albertans gathered to raise funds for services and equipment needed by children disabled by the disease. That year, the first Easter Seal and Easter lily appeared in this province. In 1959, our services expanded to assist physically disabled adults and seniors to ensure that everyone, regardless of age had someone in their corner.","No one expects to be diagnosed with an illness or injury that affects mobility, independence and dignity. But one in seven Albertans face those challenges daily. Thankfully, these individuals and their families can rely on the Easter Seals Alberta Society to provide mobility equipment, summer camps and other services to provide the best quality of life as possible. Throughout Alberta we provide low-income individuals with physical disabilities of any age with the mobility equipment they need to remain independent and to participate in their communities. The equipment we provide through our Equipment and Support Services (ESS) program is life changing. It allows for greater freedom, independence and encourages Albertans with disabilities to live to their full potential. Feeling inspired and empowered, our clients can then better focus on their goals in life which can include accessing their community to volunteer, gainning employment, shopping for groceries and attending medical appointments without having to depend on others.As a last resort program it acts as a safety net to ensure low-income does not remain a barrier for these men, women and children by ensuring that they do not fall through the cracks.Easter Seals is a blessing for seniors with limited mobility and on a fixed income. Without organizations like this, life would be almost unbearable for those seniors. They would be confined to their homes or apartments and have little or no independence. Without the help of Easter Seals, it would be impossible for seniors on a fixed income and with mobility concerns to have a reasonable quality of life.  Dermott, ESS ClientOn average there are 17 clients a month in Calgary and area on our wait list waiting for over $60,000 worth of equipment. Provincially, our monthly average is 67 clients a month waiting for over $250,000 worth of equipment. In most cases, we retain ownership of equipment that is purchased and provided. When that equipment is no longer needed, it is returned to be refurbished and recycled out the next client on our list when possible. This has become a very cost effective way of running our program as last year we provided 207 Albertans with mobility equipment at a total cost of $440,357. Out of those 207 clients, 85 received recycled equipment which saved our organization a total of $245,442.

That is why camp is so special to me. My favorite activities to do at camp are the Giant Swing because I like the thrill of being so high up in the air out of my wheelchair and the speed of swinging, and also horseback riding because it is calming and a new experience. - ZacharyLocated on 62 acres in Kananaskis Country our campers get to traverse tree-top ropes courses, swing on a giant swing, rock climb, and challenge themselves in ways they never imagined possible through the mentorship and leadership of our camp staff. Children leave camp each summer empowered with self confidence and with the knowledge that for them, anything is possible.Within Alberta, Easter Seals Camp Horizon is the only provider of residential camping programs for children with kidney impairments, ostomies and those who are burn survivors. We are proud to offer our Ostomy Camp and MS Camp as they are the only ones of their kind in Canada. Each week during the summer has tailored activities for a group of children with the same disability. This allows them to be with other children facing the same challenges and experiences. Many children who have come to camp in the past have said again and again that this has lead to lifelong friendships and helped their self-esteem tremendously knowing that they are not alone in their struggles.In addition to summer programs for children with disabilities, throughout the year we offer therapeutic recreation retreats and respites, and a treasured Christmas Camp for adults and seniors with developmental and physical disabilities. More than 60 volunteers help to make this program a cherished time for the campers who look forward to this event all year. We also host several adult camps in the late spring.","We have six main programs:Equipment and Support Services (ESS) Program provides medically-needed mobility equipment to low-income Albertans with a disability.   Easter Seals Camp Horizon is southern Albertas principal provider of outdoor and adventure recreation programs for children, youth and adults with disabilities.Easter Seals Speakers in Schools Programtakes individuals with spinal cord injuries and other physical disabilities of varied backgrounds into Alberta high schools to talk to students about staying in school, overcoming adversity, and how to properly interact with people with disabilities.Easter Seals McQueen Residence was built in Edmonton more than 35 years ago to provide 24-hour personal care and room and board, at a reasonable cost. Easter Seals McQueen Residence quickly became the model for residences for people with disabilities developing independent living skills. Residents self govern, setting their own house rules and making their own decisions.ThePhyllis Davidson Easter Seals Scholarship Program offers post-secondary scholarships to students with physical disabilities in Alberta.Through theDisability Travel Cards Program, individuals with disabilities can apply for lower travel costs by allowing their attendants to travel for free or at a reduced rate.Build New Horizons -A capital campaign for Easter Seals Camp Horizon, southern Albertas principal provider of outdoor and adventure recreation programs for children and adults with disabilities.This campaign, with campaign chair Susan Anderson and honourary chair JC Anderson, is on its way to reaching its $10 million dollar goal with $5.2 million raised. Years of planning and consideration has gone into this redevelopment plan with three main objectives; to replace aged and outdated facilities which were built 47 years ago, to give campers more quality indoor programming options, and to increase space in the facilities to accommodate our campers needs. Furthermore, the camp has had many repairs done in the past five years and more unexpected repairs continue to be needed. If Easter Seals Camp Horizon continued this path of simply reacting to urgent fixes, the future of the camp would be in jeopardy.The campaign is broken into phases, and we are very happy to report that the $4.5 million required for Phase One, which includes building one of the two new dorms has been secured, and that the first dorm will be completed in September 2014. However, our campaign has reached a critical point as funding is required to ensure construction crews remain on the property when the first dorm is complete in September to start building our second dorm.

"128",722,"Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Foundation","Created in 1995... During a ten year period from 1984-1994, private citizens - Calgarians who were grateful for the professional and caring medical service they received from Calgary EMS personnel - made donations to The City of Calgary. This source of revenue prompted the City of Calgary EMS to consider the expanded role they could play in the community by way of becoming a proactive provider of services that would ensure continued responsive service and sustainable pre-hospital care even as call volumes continued to grow.Realizing that many of the viable public education and support initiatives that could be supported by these donated funds fall outside of the mandate and the scope of publicly funded emergency medical services, caring and committed EMS personnel created The Calgary Emergency Medical Services Foundation in 1995. The Foundation from its inception to now, is a registered charity and operates independently from publicly funded emergency medical services (initally The City of Calgary and currently Alberta Health Services). Known now as the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Foundation, the mandate is to support front-line paramedics through research, education, and injury and mental health iniatitives.The EMS Foundation is committed to actions that ensure long term stability and growth. This includes development and execution of a community-based fund development plan along with development and election of a community-centred board of directors.","The EMS Foundation is one of a few charitable emergency medical services organizations in Canada fundraising to provide programs and services to continually advance the level of pre-hospital care. This effort has resulted in innovative city-wide programs that have impacted all ages and levels of heathcare provided. Success has been achieved by reaching out beyond urgent medical care to create services which educate all populations while taking a preventative approach to health. Just as hospitals raise funds for advanced equipment and procedures, the EMS Foundation raises funds as well, to provide advanced training to paramedics and ensure ambulances are equipped with state of the art equipment - to improve patient care.When you require emergency medical service - paramedics want leading edge technology in the ambulance to save your life. They look to the EMS Foundation to provide funding for training and equipment. This pursuit of excellence positions Calgarys Emergency Medical Services as an industry leader with a proven track record...First advanced life support paramedic service in CanadaFirst centre in Canada to trial paramedics on MotorcyclesFirst centre in Canada to trial paramedics on Urban Bikes (Rapid Access Paramedics)First centre in Canada to develop a Hazardous Materials paramedic programFirst communications centre in Canada to be awarded a Medical Priority Dispatch Centre of ExcellenceEmergency Medical Services in Calgary was one of the first to have:Paramedic response units (PRUs)A tactical paramedic program (TEMS)Public order paramedic program (POU)Bottom-line, Caring for You!","Capsule of Life (COL): COL allows emergency servicespersonnel to find your medical information in a timely manner when you may notbe able to provide it yourself. COL kits contain your basic medical informationplaced inside a capsule that is stored in your fridge - a very identifiable andaccessible location in your home. This program educates the public regardingthe importance of having their medical information readily at hand.Project Smile:An ambulance ride can be extremely frighteningfor a child, especially when they are already sick or hurt. Project Smileprovides sick or injured children aboard an ambulance their very own MedicMoose. Receiving this toy has proven effective in decreasing thechilds fears and anxieties allowing paramedics to provide the best care.Thousands of Medic Moose plush toys have been given to pediatric patientsaboard ambulances.Young Heroes Program: Young people between the ages of 4 and 13 are recognized annually for calling 9-1-1 appropriately in an emergency situation. This program recognizes young people whove made a difference in an emergency situation. Their actions set an excellent example for others to learn about the proper use of 9-1-1. Since 2008, over 50 young people have been honoured.CHOICES in an injury prevention program targeting junior and senior high school students. Students learn and discuss injury prevention in an interactive presentation led by a highly experienced paramedic and clinical educator. This presentation focuses on the three largest causes of injuries in youth:1) motor vehicle collisions, 2) sports and recreation incidents, and 3) falls. CHOICES hits home with students by demonstrating that the results others suffer do not have to happen and that injury can be preventable.Bursaries: In partnership with the CummingSchool of Medicine, two Paramedics receive bursaries to attend graduate studies to advance the field of pre-hospital care through research in theSEEDS program (EMS Research Education Development Studentships). This programwill develop the vital area of EMS research (a topic largely under-researched), provide education and mentorship opportunities in researchto EMS providers, and strengthen research partnerships between the EMSFoundation, the University of Calgary, and the Alberta EMS system.Equipment Purchase: The Foundation raises funds to acquire additional equipment for EMS practitioners. To date the Foundations fundraising efforts include the purchase of a Power-load Bariatric Stretcher System and Non-emergency Patient Transfer vehicles.","EMS Foundation is a registered charity, separate from Calgary Emergency Medical Services.

"130",238,"Ethno-Cultural Council of Calgary (ECCC)","My name is Dewan and I was quite an accomplished man before I moved to Canada in 2014. I take pride in my previous career as a United Nations employee and enjoyed frequent international travels. After my retirement, all I aspired for was to reunite with my children in Calgary. Moving to Canada was a life-changing moment for me. Having been a resident of a capital city with over 8.5 million people and warm sunny climate, coming to Calgary was a big change. I never realized how difficult it is for older adults like me to live and settle in CanadaI was very lonely at first, especially because I had to be on my own most of the time when my children had to work. I missed my relatives, friends, my own home, and my country of birth. So I decided to go out and look for new friends. I met Bangladeshi older adults who, like me, were experiencing similar difficulties connecting with people of their own age group. One day, I met a Bangla teacher who connected me to Ethno-Cultural Council of Calgary (ECCC), an organization that provides leadership training to immigrants and refugees. What caught my interest was their training program that provides practical tools, skills, information and contacts that I can use to help me help others. I loved the fact that the training ends with an action plan that I can shape and implement to achieve my goal of helping immigrant and newcomer older adults help themselves through connections.In between three training sessions that I attended, I went around contacting as many older adults that I could, learned about services available, improved my communication skills, and gained more confidence in talking to people whom I have never met. I felt good about connecting my contacts to programs and services. I finally started to realize that as I was helping other people, I was also helping myself feel adjusted to life in Canada.I didnt want to stop. I attended more training sessions at ECCC and served as a community connector for older adults. Through the bi-weekly training sessions, I learned about services for older adults as well as provincial and federal benefits and services that I never imagined exist. With more knowledge, I was able to help more people. I also encouraged those from the Bangladeshi community to participate in events, overcome loneliness, and find friendship and support.With support and encouragement from ECCC staff, I worked diligently with the Bangladeshi Community Centre to develop a Seniors Club which now meets twice a week. The club has been gradually attracting a larger group of older adults at every meeting. The club is not only helping older adults, but also adults who are transitioning to retirement. The club helps people prepare ahead of time for their retirement, which I know will give them a sense of security and a happier life.I am working hard with the Bangladeshi community to promote the club as a safe and welcoming group that provides genuine support to those who have to offer as well as to those in need.Participating in ECCCs leadership training program helped me fulfill my desire to support and improve the life of others. I have come to realize that a newcomer retiree like me who started with barely no contacts outside of my family, can make a huge difference in the community. I am so proud to say that I did not only get help for myself, but others too.","The Ethno-Cultural Council of Calgary came into existence in 2002 amidst the rise in racial tension following the events of September 11, 2001. From its inception, ECCC has been in the forefront of many initiatives addressing issues of diversity, human rights, racial inequities and public participation. It has built the leadership, presence and participation of diverse communities in civic activities, public consultations and policy making. The Council has also developed innovative approaches that strengthen the role of ethno-cultural communities in the design and delivery of social services, in domestic violence prevention and in neighbourhood strengthening. It has started important research on the impact of policy changes to Calgarys immigrant population.Vision -Calgary is a just and equitable society for all.Mission -We facilitate the collective voice of Calgarys ethno-cultural communities towards full civic participation and integration through collaborative action.Approximately 1700 individuals participate annually in ECCCs various programs and initiatives. Many participants go on to lead projects that benefit their own communities as well as the broader public. For example, a group composed of Vietnamese-Canadian mothers who were moved by the impact of the Calgary floods on children and families put together a fundraising concert with volunteer artists that raised $6,000 for flood relief. In another example, members of several Somali groups and partners came together to create a community assessment report of the Somali-Canadian Community in Calgary (Pathway to Belonging 2013) that is now spawning actions to address issues of isolation in the community.Our key strategies are:Leadership development and civic engagement as a cornerstone and constant element of all our workA Community Broker Model that builds on the strengths of communities and help them engage larger systems Community-based solutions to important issues, like prevention of domestic violence Collaboration and social innovation that brings different sectors and groups together to develop new approachesCombining research and community action to effect systems and policy change ANNUAL REPORT Highlights 2014-2015:The past year saw many ethno-cultural organizations grow their ability to play important roles in influencing change. These evidences of the growing capacity of ethno-cultural organizations to effect social change inspire ECCC and its 49 member organizations. They also are impetus for ECCC to continuously adapt to trends affecting our political, economic and social landscape to better support our member organizations and their communities.Weve been spurred to exert leadership and to further strengthen collaboration with our member organizations and communities to collectively respond to these developments. We have developed our Theory of Change around four strategic approaches:community-led solutions;community broker strategy;civic engagement and mobilization; and,public policy and systemschange.All our programs will integrate and connect under these pillars.Program Results:323Leaders, Brokers, and Community Organizers trained464Volunteers were recruited who contributed5,651Volunteer hours3Publications and toolkits launchedCollaborated with193Organizations, community groups and agenciesas partners and networksExecutive Directors ReportThere is growing recognition of ECCCs unique role and contribution in providing ethno-cultural perspective to nationalinitiatives and organizations. ECCC was invited as a panel presenter at the National Symposium of the Canadian BarAssociation in 2014.ECCC has demonstrated its ability to bring together different political parties to support our call for vigilance in protectingvulnerable populations from hate speech by preserving Section 3b of the Alberta Human Rights Act. Weve proven our ability to put on the table the need for increased awareness of the changing immigration policies as well as cuts to services at three levels of government, and how these impact ethno-cultural communities.We thank our funders, partners and individual donors, for their continuing confidence in ECCC, in the work that we do and in the importance of supporting ethno cultural communities to participate in the creation of an inclusive, vibrant, and just Canadian society.","We run programs in four areas of work: Leadership Training, Community Brokering, Healthy Relationships, and Research and Policy.I. Leadership TrainingWe have developed, trained and engaged a pool of 342 leaders as of 2014, representing 61 ethno-cultural groups, who speak 39 languages and take on a variety of important roles  as organizers, connectors, brokers and facilitators.We work on multiple levels to build community leaders capacity:The neighbourhood level through Community OrganizersIndividual and Community Organization capacity buildingPolicy and Civic Engagement training and public educationWe didnt know our neighbours and we didnt feel safe especially for our kids walking to and from school. So we knocked on our neighbours doors, invited families for tea, ballroom dancing, or barbecue to chat and come up with solutions that we can do together as neighbours. Now I have so many friends to rely on and help too! Community Organizer for Cultural Engagement in the NeighbourhoodEven if Im a newcomer, Ive always wanted to give back to Canada. As a result of my leadership training, I founded an organization of professional volunteers that trains immigrant elementary school children every year to creatively compose their own poems from their hearts, with a little help from mentors. A community leader from NigeriaII. Community BrokeringCommunity Brokers are trusted connectors embedded in the communities. We train Community Brokers to work on both the systems and individual level:Supporting community members or families who are in need of information about community resources, translation, and connection to servicesActing as cultural resources and connectors between ethno-cultural communities and service providers to jointly transform services and public institutions to deliver more effective and efficient services in the areas of settlement, education, health care systems, social services and the justice systemWe have trained the following:80 Community Brokers who focus on connecting newcomers and helping improve newcomer services10 Elder Brokers committed to connecting older adults in the following ethno-cultural communities: Eritrean and Ethiopian, Farsi/Persian, Filipino, Indian and Pakistani, Korean, Latin American/Latino, Middle Eastern/Arabic, Polish, Sudanese and VietnameseI am a trained community broker. My role is to connect newcomers to community resources and to supports they need. I got a bag with a resource tool kit and a USB with updated resources in Calgary. I call this my bag of tricks. When newcomers from my community approach me for questions or problems, my bag comes in handy for informed, updated and verified answers. I have referred and helped more than 40 newcomers so far. Community Broker, Building Bridges with Ethno-cultural CommunitiesAt 67 years of age, I am proud to work as an Elder Broker for my community. I can feel how seniors from my community trust me on issues such as abuse, isolation, and housing. Because of my training and connections, these seniors are connected to proper resources in a timely manner. I also enjoy meeting and learning from ten other Elder Brokers from different cultures like me.III. Healthy Relationships Our primary prevention approach to domestic violence and building healthy relationships works on three levels:Engaging men in domestic violence prevention and developing role models in healthy relationshipsWorking with young men and boys to create a new generation of menStrengthening Community intervention to encourage healthy families and relationshipsWe create safe environments for men and boys to talk about how they are impacted by immigration, violence and abuse, and how they can overcome these cycles. We engage communities in conversations, sports activities, family get-togethers and gatherings that focus on values and discuss cultural practices that promote healthy relationships.My life as a father and husband changed immensely since I joined like-minded men committed to promote healthy and awesome relationships at home and among our young boys. Member of Mens Action Network- Calgary (MANC), a community initiative in collaboration with ECCC IV. Research and PolicyWe publish policy papers and tool kits that assist ethno-cultural community members to become informed and engaged in systems and policy change initiatives. Our research and policy briefs also inform policy makers of the needs of ethno-cultural communities.Our research and policy work focuses on participatory research that engages community members and public education and community led action on systems and policy change. For example we:Conduct research on the effects of changes to the family reunification program on Calgarians.Produce a user friendly guide on changing immigration policies and provide public education presentations on the topic.Engage with ethno-cultural communities around civic participation.Produce educational policy briefs on issues of concern to ethno-cultural community members.","An inclusive city needs the efforts and contributions of all members.

"131",359,"EvenStart for Children Foundation of Calgary","Darleen lived through a childhood fraught with emotional, physical and sexual abuse. Now that she was raising her own family, she was determined to make a better life for her kids. She found a partner who she thought would help lift her up, but instead, when things got tough, he yelled at their kids and sometimes hit them. The cycle of abuse was repeating.Three of Darleens four children were born premature and suffered from developmental delays. Her daughter Sara experienced severe, severe delays -- she didnt walk, she didnt talk. She didnt interact much with the rest of the family. Doctors suspected that she suffered from some form of autism.One of Darleens older children had been referred to the EvenStart program by Child and Family Services, so she had Sara assessed at the earliest opportunity. She was accepted, and soon started attending the five-day-a-week, half-day program. She was picked up and delivered home each day on an EvenStart school bus.Darleen said it was difficult at the start because Sara wasnt accustomed to other people, and added she was about the mentality of a one-year-old, so what little speech they could get out of her you couldnt understand. She mostly communicated in grunts and pointing.But she rapidly saw improvement. Sara did speech therapy, she did occupational therapy, she did play therapy, pretty much everything (EvenStart) had to offer she took part in, she said. The results were remarkable. She started to talk, she started to actually interact to some degree with you.Sara had been very distant with her siblings. But, after working with the early childhood therapists and teachers at EvenStart, she started interacting with the other kids at home, she kind of did a 180, said Darleen.People started to exist around her, she added. Even something as simple as her bringing a toy to you, to engage you, was something she hadnt done before.Sara stayed in the program until Grade One, at which time she was ready to enter a regular school, according to Darleen. She has trouble with transitions, so transitioning to regular school I thought would be a lot harder than it was.They do still figure she is delayed, but I think the difference early intervention has made is huge in her life, she said. Sara is now in Grade Six, and Darlene reports that the teacher said that academically, shes bang on now. Shes caught right up. They still see some emotional regulation issues but they said shes really come a long way.According to Darleen, Sara loved everything about (EvenStart), the arts and crafts, and she still talks about the teachers she had. Shes got photo albums ... with pictures of her teachers throughout the years.Darleen is grateful for all the help she and her family received, including the therapeutic work with Sara and home visits from EvenStart staff. Its huge, theyve helped me in so many ways in terms of emotional support and parenting advice. Its made a huge difference in my kids lives. For all of us.(Names and identifying information have been changed to protect this familys confidentiality.)","EvenStart intervenes early in an at-risk childs life, to give them the chance to enter Grade one on an equal footing with their more fortunate peers. We build their resiliency and coping skills, to better manage their difficult circumstances. Approximately 200 children -- and their families -- are served by the EvenStart program.Through a comprehensive three-year educational and therapeutic program our goal is to reverse a childs developmental delays (cognitive, behavior, speech and language, physical) from an average of 70 to 90 per cent to within 5 per cent of childhood norms.We teach children some of the skills they need to get by in the world. In the process of fostering emtional health, we provide help with language, social appropriateness, and large and fine motor skills. Individual speech therapy, sensory integration and regulation therapy, and listening therapy are also provided.Importantly, we also work with families to provide family parenting and resource supports, our ultimate goal being the reversal/elimination of the effects of cyclical poverty on a childs promise and potential for school and life success.","The EvenStart for Children Foundation of Calgary runs an early intervention program for at-risk children ages three, four and five years. These children are born into hardship, suffering from poverty, trauma, and abuse. They suffer from developmental delays which, if not addressed, will hurt their chances for success in school and in life.Early Childhood EducationThe children are assessed when they enter the program, and started on a multi-year enrollment in an individually case-managed program. Our children have delays in most developmental areas, including speech and language, behaviour, fine and gross motor skills, cognitive abilities and social and emotional challenges.Working in partnership with the Heartland Agency, they are bussed to one of our facilities, fed two nourishing meals and provided a half-day, centre-based program -- focussing on enriching the childs environment and showing them another way to be. We provide needed therapy (speech therapy, physiotherapy, occupational therapy and psychological counselling) and family support.Family SupportParents are encouraged to participate in the program. Even in a very broken family,the relationship has significance.Parents are employed and receive a wage for their work as helping hands and riderson our school buses. They benefit from the modelling that goes on in our day programsand gain work experience.We also run two groups for our parents: the first group helps with Life Skills and we achieve this through activities such ascommunity kitchens and computer introductions; the second group recognizes that many of the parents of our EvenStart children haveexperienced the same kinds of early life experiences as their children. The groupfocuses on interventions that include nutritional and health supports, parentingskills, behaviour management, social connection to address isolation, and well asLife Skills management.","Your generous donation will ensure our programs and services continue to be available to children impacted by trauma, abuse, poverty and neglect.

These hampers are made possible by the generous donations of Calgarians such as yourself, who understand the struggle our children and their families experience each year and want to ensure these families can celebrate the beauty of the holiday season as well.We appreciate your support and dedication to ensuring at risk children receive the support they need to thrive in the future.

"134",754,"FIRST Robotics Society","Creating opportunities for students to learn and develop hands on, creative science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) skills will not only increase their career potential but also create solutions for future generations. We expose youth, many for the first time, to their career potential and to the extensive opportunities in a broad range of industry sectors.FIRST was founded over 25 years ago as a means to foster a culture where scientists, engineers and technologists would be looked up to as important contributors to society. Today, FIRST is celebrated internationally in the media, respected by government leaders, considered a valuable asset by industry, and embraced by a growing army of young people world-wide seeking knowledge, self-discovery, personal growth and a life-changing experience. One of its main objectives  and the one around which our local efforts are centered  is to inspire young people to pursue further studies and careers in the fields of science, technology and engineering.FIRST Robotics West, as we have become known, became a Society in December 2013. As an official FIRST partner organization, we are dedicated to promoting, coordinating and supporting FIRST Robotics leagues at all levels for K-12 students including connecting students with teams, finding industry mentors (i.e. software programmer and professional trades) to help support teams, providing educational resources to teams and mentors, and organizing Western Canadas largest and top-level robotics competition, FRC Western Canada Regional, along with many other events and competitions.FIRST Robotics leagues bring together communities in innovative ways, such as through team mentorship and local sponsorship, engaging youth in learning and skill development. We see the advantage to building a better future through youth and community investment. Career information, career planning options, STEM skills, mentoring and coaching youth in the areas of social responsibility, team work, leadership and community investment are all a part of FIRST Robotics West.","Months of preparation, endless building, testing and rebuilding preparing for the ultimate battle for Robot domination and the chance to compete internationally. In 2016 the Calgary Team Alberta Tech Alliance defeated 55 teams from 6 countries (Canada, China, Australia, Brazil, Israel and the United States) to bring the gold medal home to Canada from the China Robotics Challenge in Shanghai! In April 2017 49 teams participated in our FRC FIRST STEAMWORKS Western Canada Regional at the University of Calgary Olympic Oval. We welcomed high school robotics teams from Australia, China, Poland, Turkey, Mexico, the USA, and Canada as they competed for robotics glory. As Western Canadas top-level youth robotics tournament, this high-tech sporting event is exciting and energetic as participants compete in a complex STEM challenge. Alberta Tech Alliance won this years Regional and are once again off to compete in the robotics World Championships, which will be held in Houston.By creating opportunities to connect young minds to each other and to real world applications our mission is to inspire young people to pursue further studies and careers in the field of science, technology, engineering and math.FIRST Robotics is a highly dynamic and engaging program that offers tremendous potential for future talent development in Western Canada. Youth are supported by industry mentors to learn skills and enhance understanding in areas of engineering, design, fabrication, computer programming, and project planning. The annual international competition provides the opportunity to challenge and engage teams to address real life problems and work together to explore solutions.Since its incorporation in 2013, FIRST Robotics West has positively impacted 2100 youth every year, thanks to over 800 mentors and our industry partners. Below are recent statistics provided by FIRST International, which works closely with research and academic organizations to provide tangible evidence of impact on students education and career choices.Our participants experience and learn that science is fun and applicable, and build their self-confidence for STEM and  other future endeavours.STEM Interest Results: 88% of team members better understand how STEM is used to solve problems, the same percent interested in learning about science or technology.STEM Education: 86% of team members are more interested in achieving better results at school; 84% are motivated to take more challenging math or science courses.STEM Careers: 80% are more interested in jobs that are STEM related.","Youth in Kindergarten to Grade 12 design and build robots and showcase them in premier competitions, thanks to a continuum of STEM learning through several robotics leagues.FIRST Robotics West coordinates 4 program levels: Jr FIRST Lego League (Jr. FLL)  Kindergarten to grade 3FIRST Lego League (FLL)  grades 4-8FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC)  grades 7-9FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC)  grades 9 -12Team members collaborate to create robots that solve a specific challenge, from simple Lego designs for younger teams to large complex robots that require many types of skills for older teams. Competitions throughout the year provide teams an opportunity to work alongside professional mentors and leaders in the robotics industry to celebrate their hard work, share ideas and collaborate on innovations. The annual Western Canadian FIRST Robotics Challenge (FRC) Regional International Competition in Calgary for youth in grades 9-12 is our premier event.Many industries such as mining, biotechnology, oil and gas, electricity and the environment will require new STEM trained professionals, in part because of the emergent use of far more robotics across multiple sectors. Research at all levels of Government indicates a demand for a STEM trained workforce that will be required to sustain a growing innovative economy. FIRST Robotics West endeavors to help mitigate this demand by engaging youth in a higher level of science, technology, engineering and math innovation practices. To accomplish this we have set out to: Increase the number of K-12 students engaged at a higher level of STEM innovation practices.Increase participation from underserved STEM populations - females, Indigenous students, and those from at-risk and rural environments.Increase STEM opportunities available through career education, career planning, mentorship programs, increased technical skill and equal access to high quality information.Improve student potential to succeed in STEM related post-secondary and professional fields.Empower students to become leaders in science and technology and to understand social return as an investment in their future, and to enhance their future career opportunities.I can speak with confidence from witnessing many competitions and interacting with teams that FIRST Robotics Society provides students with exceptional opportunities to develop skills build confidence and establish a desire for lifelong learning. Jessica MacDonald Dow Chemical Canada","As a young non-profit organization in our 4th year, FIRST Robotics West relies on the amazing generosity of our forward-thinking sponsors from businesses, industry partners, and government and community organizations as well as the countless hours put in by volunteers.The number of individuals and teams involved in FIRST Robotics programs has increased exponentially over the past two years. The number of teams engaged in FIRST Robotics programs throughout Western Canada grew by 20% in the 2015/16 season and 50% more in the 2016/17 season, and shows no sign of slowing down. We anticipate that in the next year growth will continue at these high levels as awareness of, and interest in, FIRST Robotics programs continues to increase.Our challenge is that we dont want to have to turn any children or youth away, so we are looking for support to make that possible. The benefits of additional resources will increase opportunities for youth to prepare for, and aspire to, becoming science and technology leaders of the future; by enabling our extremely strapped largely volunteer coordinating team to get much needed support, they will continue to be able to offer our high demand, high quality programs.How can you advance the impact of FIRST Robotics? Become part of our growing network of sponsors, mentor and volunteers who see the value in promoting science, technology, engineering and mathematics through organized team sport.Sponsors We would be happy to explore with you the opportunities for sponsorships.FIRSTsponsorship opportunities include:Financial sponsorship of programs, events, and strategic initiativesIn-kind donations of parts, equipment of facilitiesScholarships  internships for studentsEmployee engagementmarketingMentors Mentors are the spark behind the great accomplishments of the students. It is a highly rewarding experience that lets you collaborate and help students achieve their goals. Mentors can provide help in technical (engineering / programming) training, organization (planning, financial, etc.) or just general support (keep students on track, track goals, etc.). Mentors mean the world to students, and you will be able to learn and experience a variety of challenges along the way.Volunteers There are a variety of volunteering positions available for all kinds of skill levels and abilities (technical and non-technical).

"135",657,"Foothills Academy Society","My son never felt like he belonged in a school setting before Foothills Academy. Right from the first day the teachers and staff made him feel like he was understood and he has since felt very welcomed and comfortable. He also had trouble making friends before Foothills but now has the best group of friends hes ever had.I will never forget our first parent/teacher interview at Foothills Academy. I was in shock as I heard the teachers say encouraging words that my husband and I have been wishing other school teachers had said (at least once) in the past 7 years of my sons schooling. Finally, we have found a haven where people understood our son!I truly believe Foothills Academy has changed our lives for the better. I almost feel I cannot put into words exactly how grateful we are that Foothills Academy exists. We now have a happy 18 year old who will graduate high school this year and go on to post secondary education with confidence and the tools for success.For parents whose child is struggling with learning, it can be difficult to find the right help. Learning Disabilities are an invisible disability that can affect academic skills, social skills, self-confidence and self-esteem. With the right identification and supports, these individuals have unlimited potential. Without the right supports, the outcomes can be grim  school disengagement and drop out, involvement in crime, poverty, addiction and homelessness are just some of the potentially negative outcomes. ----Foothills Academy was born of the frustration experienced by Bill and Beth Mackasey as their search for an appropriate academic setting for their son, Patrick, proved futile. Knowing how capable their son was, yet recognizing how little special educational programming was available for Patrick to be successful, the Mackaseys approached Gordon Bullivant and Tom Aylesworth, who were already working with special needs students, for help.Over the next two years, from 1975 to 1977, a major research project documented the services available in Calgary and across North Americaand concluded there to be a need for a segregated school for students with Learning Disabilities. Mr. and Mrs. Mackasey, Gordon and Tom, decided to continue to pursue the idea of a segregated school, and formed a society whose purpose would be to start a private, non-profit school and centre. Financial support was sought and in September of 1979 the first 33 students began their school year at Foothills Academy, located in the old St. Pius School in Capitol Hill.For the next 35 years (1979  2015) Foothills Academy thrived with Gordon Bullivant as the Executive Director and Tom Aylesworth as the Business Administrator. The current centre was built in Parkdale in 1990, and expanded in 2012 with a burgeoning student population which will reach its maximum this year at 285. The expansion also provided a greater number of counselling, assessment, and individual instruction rooms, facilitating significant growth in all of those areas as well. In 2013 the Learning Disabilities Association of Alberta  Calgary Chapter was absorbed into Foothills Academy, bringing with it the social skills program and Camp Amicus.The vision of these founders and the commitment and dedication of the employees over the past three and half decades has had a profound and positive impact on thousands of young people and families. The impact of Gordon and Tom cannot be understated, as they always wanted to ensure that no child or family would be turned away due to financial need. In accordance with their vision, Foothills Academy Society continues to raise close to $1 Million annually to support the bursary fund, allowing access to our school and community services for all.In 2015, with Toms passing and Gordons retirement, Foothills Academy entered into a new era, yet still focused on the incredible vision of these founders.","A School and So Much More! Foothills Academy Society started in 1979 to meet a unique need in Calgary for children diagnosed with Learning Disabilities. The Society has two mandates: to serve children and youth with Learning Disabilities in aSchool Program and to serve the greater community throughCommunity Services. Foothills Academy School is a non-profit private school for students with diagnosed Learning Disabilities in grades 3 - 12. The school offers a safe haven to children who have been frustrated by traditional schooling, disheartened by a lack of support for their unique learning style and perhaps been bullied because they just dont fit in.Estelle Siebens Community Services assists children, youth and adults who are experiencing difficulties in their school, work and/or home environments as a result of Learning Disabilities, ADHD and/or social/emotional challenges. Community Services provides programs and services to residents of Calgary and beyond on a year-round basis. We offer psycho-educational testing, individual and groupcounselling, intensive reading/writing/ mathematics/study skills individualized instruction programs, summer camps (Camp Amicus), year-round recreation (Amicus Recreation), parent education, research, and training for pre- and in-service educators.It has always been part of Foothills philosophy to never turn someone away due to financial circumstances. As a result, close to $1 million must be raised each year to support the bursary program at Foothills. Donations are always welcome to help support the needs of individuals and families affected by Learning Disabilities and ADHD.(Foothills Academy) is perceived by thelearning disabilities community across North America to bean excellent role model for private education for children who need special help. The success of the schools graduates and their loyalty to the school over the years speaks volumes. I think everyone in Calgary knows that a child is lucky to be admitted to this school. -Dr. Bonnie Kaplan, University of CalgaryANNUAL REPORT HIGHLIGHTS 2015-2016Our school growth is at capacity, with a forecast of 275 students, our focus was on two areas. First, we will continue to deliver the most effective teaching for students with Learning Disabilities. Second, we will transfer our research, knowledge and excellence out wider through Community Services. With our new collaborative approach, we are dedicated to securing successful growth, development and equity in the School Program and Community Services.285 students were enrolled in our School Program (grades 3 to 12) who received accomodations and supports according to their individual need.123 or 45% of our school families recieved financial assistance through the Foothills Academy Bursary Fund.Weve reached the maximum number of students that our building will accomodate and have started a waiting list (a complete school performance report and three year plan is available on our website).","Foothills Academy Society consists of two parts - a full-time School Program and Community Services. 1.Foothills Academy School is a Designated SpecialEducation private school serving over 285 students with Learning Disabilities from grade 3 - 12 following the Alberta Education curriculum.Classes typically have no more than 14 students with a teacher and a part-time assistant.

"136",741,"Fort Calgary Preservation Society","The confluence of the Bow and Elbow Rivers is a significant place. Known to the Blackfoot as MohKinsstis, the confluence has special meaning to the Siksika  it is the place where Napi created people, tracing its history to the very origins of humanity. This site is at the heart of traditional Blackfoot territory, and was important to other Indigenous peoples who came here to hunt, camp, and cross the river. For thousands of years, the confluence has retained its significance as a gathering place.The confluence is also the place where the North West Mounted Police began their mission to bring peace, order and good government to western Canada. The humble Fort built on this site, in 1875, was the foundation of the city of Calgary and played a significant role in the evolution of Canadas world-renowned RCMP. The original fort evolved from a police administration centre into the centre of the growing community.Today the confluence is where the past meets the present. Fort Calgary tells the stories of many cultures that continue to evolve and define who we are as Calgarians. It is a place where people gather to gain a richer understanding of how our past shapes our present and future. It is a place for truth, and for reconciliation.","Fort Calgary is unique. It is a national, provincial and municipal historic site that marks the original location of the North West Mounted Police (NWMP) Fort built in 1875 at the confluence of the Bow and Elbow Rivers. It is the symbolic hub and heart of the community. It is the authentic lens through which Calgarys history is interpreted.People have been coming to this site for thousands of years, and today it is a major attraction in the rapidly developing neighbourhood of East Village. Located on 40 acres of parkland on the eastern edge of downtown Calgary, our outdoor site provides access to Riverwalk along the Bow and Elbow Rivers, a constructed wetland, a community garden that donates produce to the Drop-In Centre, and a place to contemplate the citys origins in a beautiful setting.Inside, we offer temporary and permanent exhibits exploring Calgarys diverse history in our Interpretive Centre. RCMP Veterans volunteer countless hours sharing their personal experiences with the Force, giving visitors an authentic link to the Forts past. Meeting and banquet facilities are available to celebrate, plan and create events that add to the stories of the people and organizations of Calgary.Each year, thousands of school children from Calgary and the surrounding area visit our Learning Centre to participate in hands-on programming with direct links to the Alberta Social Studies, Language Arts and Science curriculum. Our fun, interactive programs led by trained facilitators encourage inquiry-based learning and critical thinking about history and the environment.A short stroll across the Elbow leads to the Deane House, the former home of Captain Richard Burton Deane, the Forts last Commanding Officer, and the only remaining building from the Mounted Police era. The Deane House, currently closed for rehabilitation as part of our MAKE HISTORY Capital Campaign, offers a restaurant featuring fresh, local cuisine. Also under restoration is the Hunt House, once the residence of the Hudsons Bay Company Factor and the oldest house in Calgary on its original location.","Our goal is to raise peoples awareness about Fort Calgary and to make them understand the significance of the Fort in their community. Our award-winning School Programs are one of the ways we achieve that goal.Fort Calgary offers twelve different school programs for grades kindergarten through seven. Our school programs objectives are focused on building an understanding of the North West Mounted Police and the important role that they played in Calgarys early history and development. The programs are linked to the Alberta Learning Program curriculum and cover a range of topics. For example, Calgary: A Prairie Community, one of our most popular programs, celebrates the diversity of our prairie home. Students build a giant 3-D map of our city and celebrate the language and culture of Calgarys founding communities. The children get a chance to dress in costume, learn new languages and handle artifacts as they learn what make different cultures unique.Tours of the Fort Calgary Interpretive Centre and 1888 Barracks are also essential in telling our story. A visit to Fort Calgary begins with a brief history of the founding of Fort Calgary and the founding of the North West Mounted Police in Canada. Individuals/Groups are greeted by our interpretive staff who will bring to life the defining moments in the opening of the Canadian West through authentic experiences and our original location. A video presentation is included to enrich the guest experience. The remaining portion of the tour is self-directed and visitors can explore our many temporary and permanent exhibits. Visitors are encouraged to have their picture taken in an authentic Mounted Police uniform. It is also highly recommended that visitors leave time to explore the site and stroll along the scenic Bow and Elbow Rivers.Special Events are integral in reaching larger audiences and connecting with our community. Winter Carnival, Mountie Day, Canada Day, Heritage Day, Alberta Culture Days and Doors Open YYC are all free, family oriented events. These events give Fort Calgary a chance to reach a broader demographic of people who may not have the financial means to visit Fort Calgary.We also encourage people to make their own history with our Food and Beverage Department. What better place to plan for the future or celebrate the past than the place where it all began? Fort Calgary provides an authentic historical setting for meaningful events. With full-service meeting and banquet facilities, our guests can rest assured that they will experience Fort Calgarys well-earned reputation for western hospitality.Fort Calgary also hosts private and Corporate events such as the Downtown Rotary Stampede Round-Up Concerts and X-Fest.Ultimately, Fort Calgary is a place where Calgarians will come for all kinds of reasons: educational, social, recreational and business. Whatever the reason, we strive to ensure that they will leave feeling that they understand, respect and belong to Calgary.","Fort Calgary has exciting opportunities for you to become a part of history:1.

"137",354,"Forte Musical Theatre Guild","Calgarys theatre community has an international reputation for the development of new Canadian plays but when Forte Musical Theatre Guild was founded in 2008, there were very few new musicals being produced in Calgary and many of our young artists who were passionate about musical theatre were leaving to study and work elsewhere.Joe Slabe founded Forte Musical Theatre to create engaging and intimate evenings of award-winning entertainment and to provide educational and professional development opportunities for students, writers and young professionals to gain experience in this dynamic art form.Since then, Forte has launched the careers of performers, technicians and writers, and employed dozens of artists in our award-winning productions. Forte enriches Calgarys cultural landscape with its programming and makes it possible for musical theatre artists to train and work locally.In 2014, JP Thibodeau directed Touch Me: Songs for a (dis)Connected Age and the production was awarded the Calgary Critics Award for Best Production of a Musical. The next year, he directed Fortes production of Naughty but Nice! and JP was honoured with the Calgary Critics Award for Best Director of a Musical.Working with Forte has allowed me to truly come into my own as a director. Their willingness and thirst for taking emerging artists and showcasing them is what makes working with them so special. Sharing the talents of tomorrow, today.    JP Thibodeau, Director","Forte Musical Theatre Guild is a company on the leading edge of musical theatre in Canada. We are the only professional company in Western Canada dedicated exclusively to new musicals and, with our stable of established and emerging artists, we create intimate and engaging new Canadian musicals.Forte aims to achieve an international reputation in new musicals and took our first step in this direction by staging Crossing Swords at the New York Musical Theatre Festival in 2013. Fortes production of Crossing Swords won five festival awards including Best Book and the Theater for the American Musical Prize for Outstanding Integration of Book, Music and Lyrics. As a result of our festival appearance, Crossing Swords will be produced at a major regional theatre in New Jersey in April of 2016.Locally, Forte produces one or two new musicals a year for Calgary audiences and has been nominated for Outstanding Production of a Musical by the Betty Mitchell Awards in each of the last five years. Forte is the only company in Calgary to be nominated in this category five years in a row.Forte also employs both established and emerging artists in our shows and many of them have been honoured with nominations and awards, including Allison Lynch Griffiths  cast member in Fortes productions of Twisted and Maria Rasputin Presents.Working with Forte has opened a whole lot of doors for me. Not only have I grown as an actor and singer by performing and working with world class artists in Forte productions, but Ive had the opportunity to showcase my own songwriting, for which I received a Betty Mitchell Award. The work that has come my way since is in no small part because of those opportunities Forte provided me as an emerging artist.  Allison Lynch Griffiths, Actor","Fortes primary programming is the production of new Canadian musicals and we accept submissions from professional writers from across the country and beyond. The musicals Twisted, Touch Me: Songs for a (dis)Connected Age and Naughty but Nice! were created by curating song submissions into evenings on the themes of unconventional relationships, the impact of technology in our lives, and the holiday season, respectively.Forte has also partnered with the Alberta Playwrights Network to offer classes in musical theatre writing, and gives student performances and master classes in conjunction with Calgary high schools. This, in addition to our work with professional artists, cultivates both new and emerging talent.Forte not only gave me an opportunity to have my writing and music seen on the stage, but has continued to provide motivation, support and encouragement for me to continue writing and composing new works. - Dan Perrott, Writer and ComposerOur Past Shows2015 Naughty but Nice!- A seasonal treat that knows that Santas Your Daddy and that theres nothing better than Baileys for Breakfast! Winner of two Calgary Critics Awards, Naughty but Nice!featured 21 new songs and arrangements by composers from Calgary, Toronto, New York and London, UK.2014 Touch Me: Songs for a (dis)Connected Age is a one-act musical revue featuring songs composed by writers from across Canada. Funny, tuneful and sometimes poignant, Touch Me is bound to get you thinking about the connections in your life. Winner of the Calgary Critics Award for Best Production of a Musical!2013 Crossing Swords - Fortes first stab at producing internationally saw Crossing Swords (previously Jeremy de Bergerac) play the 2013 New York Musical Theatre Festival where it won the Awards for Excellence in Writing (Book), Direction, Musical Direction, Individual Performance and the Theatre for the American Musical Prize!2013 Maria Rasputin Presents - At the end of her life, Maria Rasputin puts on one last performance in an attempt to rehabilitate her fathers infamous legacy. But will the persistent voice of his assassin ruin her plans?

Nominated for three Calgary Critics Awards and five Betty Mitchell Awards including Outstanding Production of a Musical and Outstanding New Play.2011 Title of Show - Forte was thrilled to bring this funny and heartfelt show about chasing your dreams to Calgary audiences.2011 Twisted - An evening of songs about unconventional relationships all by Calgary composers! Whatever the quirks, the quibbles, the kooks, the kinks, chances are good that something in Twisted will be familiar. After all, who has ever had a relationship without a twist?2010 Austentatious - After sell-out runs and critical raves in London, Philly, New York (Off Broadway) and London again, Austentatious, a show co-written by our very own Artistic Director, Joe Slabe, came to Calgary to make its Canadian premiere!2009 but this IS my day job... - Fortes very first production was a musical revue featuring songs from musicals that had never had professional productions in Calgary and featured the work of composers from Calgary and around the world.","Forte has accomplished a lot in the past six years but we couldnt have done it without the support of our donors and volunteers!Ticket revenues typically only pay for a third to a half of our production expenses so we are grateful to the many individuals and corporations who have donated time, money and services to us over the years.Your tax-deductible donation helps us to transform the musical theatre community in Calgary by allowing us to continue to hire acclaimed performers, designers and craftspeople as well as cultivate new talent through our apprentice and mentorship programs.Forte also provides numerous opportunities for volunteer support at various commitment levels. Whether its serving as a member of our board of directors, volunteering at one of our casinos, or ushering for our productions, were grateful for the help Calgarians have given in the past and encourage you to consider volunteering for us in the future. Together, were creating shows that nurture and showcase the very best Calgary talent while contributing to a lively cultural scene where performers can choose to live and work in our dynamic city.I know Ive said it before and I know Ill be saying it again but these Forte shows, as well as being highly entertaining, are a reminder of just how much homegrown talent we have and kudos to Joe Slabe for consistently showcasing it. Louis B. Hobson, The Calgary SunForte Musical Theatre is a wonderful professional company dedicated to debuting new musical works and fostering new talent. I am forever grateful to Forte for taking a chance on me as a young, emerging artist. By including seasoned professionals and new artists together, they foster a safe place to learn, grow, receive mentorship while performing new, exciting work. - Selina Wong, Actor","http://www.fortemusical.ca/","moconnor@shaw.ca","857473060RR0001","403.461.7694","Maureen O'Connor","102125","art perform artist theatr",137,0.0175438596491228,0.0112280701754386,0.0154385964912281,0.0133333333333333,0.0175438596491228,0.0112280701754386,0.0112280701754386,0.0154385964912281,0.023859649122807,0.0175438596491228,0.00912280701754386,0.0154385964912281,0.790175438596491,0.0175438596491228,0.0133333333333333
"138",460,"Fresh Start Recovery Centre","Today hes one of the top students in his pre-med program but three years ago Johns life was completely different. His dad is a doctor, his mother a nurse, his brother and sister are honours students and so was he. You wouldnt expect him to be an addict, driving the getaway car for his pals who were robbing pharmacies to get Oxycodone, but there he was. He didnt get there overnight; and he didnt come back overnight either  both roads were long and filled with heartache. The road down was a terrifying, lonely freefall and the road back was like an ascent of Everest accompanied by many Sherpas taking many forms.When Johns family moved to the US years ago his parents were concerned about the quality of schooling and decided to home school their three children. When they moved back to Canada, John was just going into grade 10 and while homeschooling did wonders for his academic record, his social skills  well, they were more than lacking. He felt that he didnt really fit in anywhere and kept to himself mostly. Eventually some guys invited John to hang with them and he began to feel that he was part of something and not alone. They would smoke and drink, then blaze (smoke pot) and graduated to harder drugs eventually taking the highly addictive Oxycodone and its there that his life really began to take a tailspin.While John started to use Oxy occasionally, he soon came to depend on it and developed an addiction to the drug. As Johns Oxy use increased his school attendance decreased along with his grades that quickly dropped from As to Ds and Fs until he dropped out of grade 11 midway through his fall semester. With dwindling resources to support their habit, John and his friends thought it would be a good idea to go directly where their drug of choice was and started robbing pharmacies. What seems to be a good idea to an addict typically is not and their brilliance soon ended with all of them being arrested and charged.A judge looked at Johns limited criminal history and believed that John was a good person and, had it not been for the addiction that he developed, he would not have done the things that earned him his record.Embarrassed, dejected and determined to prove to his family that he was the good person that they believed he was, John found Fresh Start Recovery Centre and began his journey on the road to long-term recovery. John enrolled in Fresh Starts 12-week, 12-Step program, excelled, moved into our second stage program.Johns family was also determined to understand the disease of addiction and what they could do to help their sons recovery without enabling him. Both parents enrolled in Fresh Starts family Healing Program and made a six hour round trip every week for five weeks to attend the two hour classes. Just before one full year into his recovery John thought hed visit his old friends and share with them how well he was doing and perhaps inspire them. Not having a full appreciation of his vulnerability and not realizing that recovery doesnt have the same meaning for everyone the visit ended with him giving into peer pressure and blazing with his old pals.John immediately realized his mistake, left his friends and told his family what had happened.Embarrassed and dejected John came to back to Fresh Start to pack his things and go to another recovery centre feeling that he had let us down. One of the Fresh Starts Sherpas drove John to the other centre and during the 40 minute drive convinced him to give himself another chance with the realization that addicts are never cured of their disease but - as with other chronic illnesses like diabetes  are able to manage it and enjoy a normal, healthy life.John ended up coming back to Fresh Start, going on to complete his program for a second time, living in Fresh Starts supported second and third stage housing while earning his high school equivalency and then pursuing his dream of a career in Medicine.A few short weeks ago a doctor stood in front of 120 people at one of Fresh Starts Birthday Celebrations and presented his son with his 2 year medallion and through wavering voice and teary eyes thanked Fresh Start for being by Johns side during his long climb of recovery. He was grateful that John had achieved two years of continuous sobriety and honours standing in his pre-med program.Who knows, someday in the future the doctor that treats you and perhaps saves your life could be the addict - in recovery - that you helped to save.","Since 1992, Fresh Start Recovery Centre has been recovering lives previously devastated by the disease of addiction. In June 0f 2012 we opened a purpose built 40,000 square foot facility to house treat and support 50 men at a time and providethe essential components to support the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual aspects of recovery in a homelike setting.While treatment typically costs each man $10,000 - $12,000 we operate on a sliding scale where participants pay what they can afford with different funding sources typically covering 45% of the costs and community donations (individuals, foundations and corporations) accounting for the other 55%. Fresh Start WILL ALWAYS provide help to those who need it and demonstrate a willingness to do the work required to recoverno matter whattheir financial situation may be. More than half of the men who call Fresh Start home have no home before they enter our doors. For many, we are their last chance to stop before jail, institutions or death.

Those who come to us with a few hours or a few days of sobriety are still foggy and not thinking clearly. The Assesment Phase gives people a few extra days to start thinking more clearly to ensure that the information in the 12-Step program has a better chance of being understood, absorbed and used.   TREATMENT PHASE | This is an intensive 12 week program that has evolved and been adapted to ensure that participants get the benefit and balance of a personal wellness plan and group participation. Enhancements to the program that may be different from many other 12-step programs include but are not limited to participation in:Optional personalized wellness regimen through Pure North SEnergy FoundationOur Creative arts Program to help participants put more tools in their toolboxBe a great Dad program for fathers in recovery offered through Families MatterMike Miles Muay Thai  Kickboxing instructionTRANSITIONAL PLANNING PHASE| 1 - 2 Week Period - during this time we help people put their strateguies to work including finding and attending 12 Step meetings, attending counselling andcontinuingwith a spiritual development consistemnt with their beliefs andhigher power as they understand.

There are many who continue to live in the shadow and consequences of someone elses addiction and the family Healing Program is designed to help make sense of the insanity and support the person in recovery without being consumed by them.","With your help Fresh Start Recovery Centre has been recognized across Canada for our effective program delivery by winning the Calgary Award for Outstanding Community Advocate  Agency 2012,two United Way of Calgary  Areas Bhayana Family Foundation Awards in 2014 (one for Collaboration and the other for Leadership),selected as one of the top three treatment centres in Canada by the Donner Canadian Foundation every year since 2006,won the Donner Canadian Foundation Award for THE #1 Agency in Canada for Prevention  Treatment of Substance Abuse in 2014, 2013  2010, as well as William H Donner Award for Excellence in Social ServiceDelivery (Best Social Serving Agency)and Peter F Drucker Award for Non-Profit Management in 2014 for our consistent record of excellence and innovation inmanagement and service delivery.

"139",489,"Friends of Fish Creek Provincial Park Society ","I remember swimming at Sikome Aquatic Facility when I was 10 years old, watching the trucks drive over the bridge across the Bow River along Highway 22X, and thinking that Fish Creek Provincial Park really was on the edge of the city. That was long before neighborhoods like McKenzie Towne, Cranston, Auburn Bay, Chapparal and Silverado were developed - and Shawnessy and Evergreen were under construction. Growing up in Deer Ridge, I was always thankful to live so close to this park and enjoyed many visits to Sikome, Mallard Point and the vast grassland area along the Bow River. I always had the impression that the park was a wild place, far away from the stresses of school, parents and city life, a place where I could be alone and relax, or spend time with friends without grownups around. In the past 20 years the city of Calgary has grown and literally engulfed the park. Each year more people enjoy the park, but the potential impact on this area also increases. Fish Creek is a truly unique and amazing area that all Calgarians are fortunate to have as an extension of our own backyard. The Friends of Fish Creek exists so that people can enjoy the park and all it has to offer, and work to raise awareness about preserving this valuable natural resource so future generations will enjoy it as much we do today.","Fish Creek Provincial Park is one of the largest urban parks in Canada and is an extensive protected natural area with much to offer. The park is a place to appreciate and experience nature close to home, be active, spend time with family, and relax and unwind in this beautiful, unique setting.Fish Creek Provincial Park receives over 3 million visitors a year. It is a major recreational facility for the surrounding communities and has been a mainstay of family recreation for close to 40 years. The parks ecosystems need to be protected. Financial and voluntary contributions to the Friends of Fish Creek are reinvested into the park and the majority of volunteer programs the Friends offer have measurable and visible impacts.HISTORY - The Friends of Fish Creek was incorporated as a Registered Charity in 1994 and for the past 20 years we have been dedicated to preserving this park for the benefit of the people who depend on it. We collaborate with park management, volunteers, community organizations and Society members, the majority of whom live within the nearby communities.The Friends of Fish Creek office is located at the Cookhouse in the historical Bow Valley Ranch area of Fish Creek Provincial Park. We started as volunteer-run non-profit organization and now have 4 staff members, additional support staff, over 700 Society members, approx. 400 volunteers, many of whom are high-skilled volunteers with a wealth of knowledge to share, over 100 community partners throughout the city and province, including local businesses, community associations, non-profit groups and local media outlets.The Friends create informed park users by engaging community members through public awareness and encouraging the responsible use and enjoyment of Fish Creek Provincial Park. Through environmental education and the fostering of ecological literacy, the Friends inspire stewards to respect the park as an amazing natural resource for the community to enjoy.MISSON - To engage the community through education and awareness to conserve a truly unique naturalized urban park.VISION -A sustainable Fish Creek Provincial Park that improves the quality of life for present and future generations.","The Friends collaborate with volunteers to deliver programs, courses, events and activities throughout the year to help create informed users and preserve the ecological integrity of the park. New Wellness programs such as Yoga, Guided Meditation and Running Clinics provide innovative ways for people to relax, rejuvenate and reconnect with nature in Fish Creek.PARK TOURS - In the Summer of 2014 we expanded on the Minibus program to include tours of the park that focus on the unique geology of this area, the wetlands, natural features, unique history, nature photography as well as private tours. Minibus tours provide people with accessibility issues and mobility problems a means to experience Fish Creek Provincial Park. Participation at community outreach events in the nearby communities enable the Friends to connect with and engage people about who we are, what we do and how they can help preserve the park.EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS - Long standing educational programs like Speaker Series and the Birding Courses are primarily volunteer-run and attract hundreds of people a year to the park.

"141",482,"La Fondation franco-albertaine","I was born in a French-Canadian family on a farm near the small town of Plamondon (pop. 250) situated approximately 200 kilometres north of Edmonton. As a family, we spoke French at home however we only had one hour of French per day at school.This amounted to many children growing up with a poor knowledge of their first language and sometimes ending up not comfortable to speak it anymore.As an adult and father, I met a francophone leader from Edmonton who made me realize what a treasure my parents had bestowed on me with my French language and culture and how it was slipping away. French is my heritage, its another window on the world, another way to understand any situations, its music and songs, plays and dances - its another sense of humor, another way to live, another way to love, its friends everywhere in my country and around the world who share my language.Other francophones from Plamondon and I founded the French-Canadian association of Plamondon/Lac La Biche followed by helping to establish a francophone school and cultural centre.Now that Im retired, I would like to leave a legacy, to help my community grow and develop beyond my ability to be there to do so. Younger people are now at the head of the French association, more than a hundred children are in the French school in my village and I want to make sure they have financial support to help them discover the beauty of their French legacy.That is where La Fondation franco-albertaine plays an important role in my personal story as it has enabled me to set up an endowment fund to help them year after year to leave wonderful experiences and develop new projects.- Reed Gauthier, DonorThe Francophone heritage in Alberta dates back to the earliest days of the fur trade when the Montreal peddlers came to the Northwest region in search of adventure and business opportunities. The voyageurs married Cree women and the first Francophone communities, Métis communities, were established. Members of religious orders came and were followed by settlers. In this process, which spanned over 200 years, significant contributions were made to the settlement of the West and the founding of Alberta. Early pioneers knew the importance of establishing institutions such as schools, churches, and community organizations.The French-speaking community has since grown and contributed to the social, cultural and economic development of the province. As the community expands, the need for resources and services in French increase, thus putting more financial strain on non-profit organizations and the public sector. Through the promotion of philanthropy, La Fondation franco-albertaine, with more than $330,000 given back to the community, works towards the development and vitality of the many francophone cultures that are an essential part of our Canadian identity.---------------------------Je suis né dans une famille canadienne-française sur une ferme près du village de Plamondon (population 250 personnes) situé à 200 kilomètres au nord dEdmonton. Comme famille nous parlions français à la maison, mais nous navions quune heure décole en français par jour.Cest ce quont vécu de nombreux jeunes qui ont grandi dans mon village et dans plusieurs villes et village en Alberta.Plusieurs se sont retrouvés peu confortables à parler la langue de leur ancêtre et plus à laise à communiquer en Anglais En tant quadulte et père, jai rencontré une leadeur francophone dEdmonton qui ma fait prendre conscience du Trésor de la langue française que mes parents mont légué et comment cette richesse se dissipait peu à peu.Donc, des amis francophones de notre village et moi ont décidé de créer lassociation canadienne-française de lAlberta de Plamondon - Lac La Biche puis, avec un groupe de parents dévoués nous avons établi un centre culturel et une école francophone. Je me suis ensuite impliqué sur de nombreux comités francophones provinciaux.Maintenant je suis à la retraite et je désire laisser un héritage qui aidera ma communauté à continuer à grandir et à se développer au-delà de ma vie.Cest là que La Fondation franco-albertaine joue un rôle important dans mon histoire en me permettant de créer un fonds de dotations qui continuera, longtemps après mon départ, à appuyer les causes qui me sont si chères au coeur.- Reed Gauthier, DonateurLe patrimoine francophone en Alberta remonte aux premiers jours de la traite des fourrures lorsque les marchands montréalais sont venus dans la région du nord-ouest à la recherche de laventure et des occasions daffaires. Ces voyageurs ont épousé des femmes cries et les premières communautés francophones de la province, des communautés métisses, ont été établies. Ensuite, les membres dordres religieux ont été suivis par des colons. Au cours de ce processus qui a duré plus de 200 ans, des contributions importantes ont été apportées pour la colonisation de lOuest et la fondation de lAlberta.La francophonie albertaine est dimportance historique, politique, économique, culturelle et sociale. La documentation du riche patrimoine de cette communauté de langue officielle et la création de matériaux pour renforcer lidentité et la fierté communautaires sont très importantes. La francophonie albertaine existe depuis plus de 200 ans. Elle sest organisée pour créer des associations, des écoles dimmersion, des écoles francophones, des églises et des centres culturels. Cest acquis sont fragile et plusieurs reste encore à être obtenus. En développant la philanthropie, La Fondation franco-albertaine avec plus de 330000$ remis à la communauté travaille à consolider et à développer une langue et des cultures qui sont au cœur de lidentité canadienne.","La Fondation franco-albertaine is a community foundation that helps donorsfulfill theirphilanthropic dreams throughthe power of endowment funds.Over the past 10 years, La Fondation helped 75 families, organizations, communities and individuals to create an endowment fund.Each year approximately 4 % of theseinvestments are granted toorganizations and causes that areimportant to our donors. To date,La Fondation franco-albertaine has grantedmore than $330,000 tola Francophonie.The French-speaking community has grown and contributed to the social, cultural and economic development of the province. As the community expands, the need for resources and services in French increase, thus putting more financial strain on non-profit organizations and the public sector. Francophones are settling in Alberta from every part of the world adding to the 238,000 French speaking Albertans. Many important but fragile institutions and organizations help those citizens. Financial help from governments for these organizations has not increased over the last twenty years despite the growth in population. La Fondation franco-albertaine needs endowment funds to help organizations get meaningful, useful, regular revenue to support their basic programs and operations. This is why, La Fondation franco-albertaine needs to increase its endowment funds. ------------La Fondation franco-albertaine est une fondation communautaire qui aide les donateurs à accomplir leurs buts philanthropiques par la dotation.

De nouveaux arrivants parlant français de partout dans le monde sinstallent en Alberta chaque année et sadditionne au 238 000 qui sont déjà en Alberta. Il y a de nombreux et importantes mais fragiles organisations et institutions qui aident ces citoyens.

Seeds are tossed into earth, water rains down on thirsty plants, and friends gather together to eat some of their freshly grown vegetables.There is a quiet hum as bike tires slide across smooth pavement and in the background there is a sizzle of meat cooking on a BBQ.A loud crunch echoes through the air, then laughter quickly follows as children dive in and out of piles of leaves.These are all sights and sounds you can come to expect when visiting a community association.

"143",103,"The Further Education Society of Alberta ","The success of our learners is why we do what we do. Here is one example:I was concerned about my daughter when I realized that, at 9 years old, she was having serious trouble reading. It was when I was visiting a family resource centre that I noticed FESAs Literacy and Parenting Skills (LAPS) program. I decided to attend in hopes of helping my daughter. I began learning more about how to help with her literacy challenges, and after several weeks I was feeling more confident with my own literacy and parenting skills. While taking this program I discovered that I enjoyed, and had a talent for helping other parents.By the next year my daughters reading skills were greatly improved and I had become a leader in the group. Because of my progress and my ability to help others, I was asked to become an assistant to the facilitator. FESA provided me the training I needed, and soon I was able to lead and facilitate my own programs.Fast-forward to today: My daughter is about to successfully complete high school, and now has also begun working as an assistant. I have been a much valued member of the FESA team where I have assisted numerous learners each year as a FESA facilitator.Past Learner and FESA Facilitator","The Further Education Society of Alberta (FESA) is a registered charitable organization, and was incorporated as a not-for-profit in 1996. We focus on learners with the lowest levels of literacy and education and envision Canada as a literate and learning society that allows everyone to reach their full potential.In cooperation with grassroots community agencies, we respond to the learning needs of high-risk groups through various projects and programs; all focused on improving learners confidence and skills in literacy and learning. Challenges that these learners face include: poverty, abuse, low-literacy, single-parenting, recent immigration, lack of support systems, unemployment, learning disabilities, addictions, unfamiliarity with community resources and/or formalized systems.MISSION | Tostrengthen communities, families and individuals through literacy and learning.VISION | Envision a Canada where every man, woman and child reaches their potential, where every parent gets the help he or she needs, where there are no barriers to learning. This is the Canada we are working to build. We truly believe that education is the great equalizer and that the desire to learn is a powerfully motivating force. If we, as community members, can support someones desire to learn we are giving that person the opportunity to change his or her life.ACCOMPLISHMENTS | In 2000, FESA was awarded the Canada Post Literacy Award - Community Leadership in Literacy for our Literacy and Parenting Skills (LAPS) training program. In 2013, we were the recipients of the nationally recognized Council of the Federation Literacy Award for our achievements in literacy and learning.","FESAs emphasis is on providing literacy and essential skills education to level 1 and 2 learners. We do this through a vast portfolio of programs and projects, concentrating on four core areas: Research and Curricula Development, Train the Facilitator Program, Community Outreach and Development, and Program Delivery.Calgary Community Family Literacy Program (CCFLP) In Calgary, programs are delivered through the Community Family Literacy Program (CCFLP), which models best practices and effective partnerships for agencies who are trying to establish LAPS programs in their communities. Each year, FESA runs 70+ programs in partnership with over 35 community agencies, and serves over 700 learners in the Calgary area. Our facilitators deliver welcoming educational programs at locations where learners live or access services. All programs are free of charge and we are always looking to build our work with new partners and various community organizations to provide unique offerings for learners.Train the Facilitator As part of the Train the Facilitator program, FESA has developed highly innovative curricula and works to train other organizations in our successful approaches to working with low-literate learners. Facilitators work all across Canada so that FESAs reach is truly nationwide.

Rather, she has become a happier more self-confident person, with high personal standards and a strong pride in her personal identity. She is thrilled to have friends as well as to know the leaders and volunteers, who are either of Aboriginal heritage and/or people who practice the values of respect and caring for all life. It has been an eye-opener for her to see the leaders setting and attaining personal goals and interacting in their positive life-affirming manner both as a team, with the elders, and with the children and youth in the camps.Ghost River Rediscovery has made such a positive impact on our 15 year old granddaughter that her ambition is to become a leader with them. When I asked her, what Ghost River Rediscovery meant to her, she said Role models who do what they love and share it with us, good friends, loving nature and the outdoors, great food, the leaders who always have funny stories, the learning about your own courage and inner strength from solo. Our granddaughter is already counting down the months until summer camp.Over the years, our financial circumstances have dictated that sometimes we couldnt afford to pay the full fees for camp, and our granddaughter was anxious that she may not be able to attend. However, thankfully, with the generous support of funders, the Ghost River subsidy was available to help.Thank-you for taking the time to read this letter.

"145",432,"Glenbow - Alberta Institute (Glenbow Museum)","Glenbow is Calgarys cultural cornerstone. Established as a museum in 1966, Glenbows mandate is to celebrate and share the history, creativity and beauty of Western Canada. Our purpose is to make art and history accessible and meaningful to our community.Our collection represents objects and ideas that have shaped the history and culture of the place we live. Glenbow exists to build bridges between history and present; to spark conversations and inspire people to care about art and culture.Through our exhibitions and programs, we have a unique ability to illuminate and entertain as we introduce our visitors to innovative ideas and important stories from western Canada and around the world. Our goal is to challenge assumptions and spark creativity.Glenbow is always evolving to provide new ways for Calgarians and visitors to engage with our collection and to share stories about ideas, events, objects and people that fascinate and inspire. Glenbow is a place where people of all ages can learn or get fresh ideas while they explore the galleries or take part in a program. Our hope is that every visitor to the museum has an opportunity to stumble across something unexpected and wonderful.In 2014, Glenbow was pleased to present the exhibition Where are the Children? organized by the Legacy of Hope Foundation. The exhibition of photographs and archival documents examined the experiences, consequences and ongoing impact of Canadas residential school system on Aboriginal peoples. During the run of the exhibition, Glenbow offered school program tours of Where are the Children led by one of our Aboriginal educators, Sheldon First Rider, himself a survivor of residential schools. Feedback from a teacher who brought their class to Glenbow for this tour illustrates the impact that thoughtful programming and exhibition interpretation can have on an audience:I knew that (the Where are the Children? exhibition) was a great opportunity to expose my students to real life learning experiences, but I have realized how lucky we were to have had Sheldon tell us his story. It was so much more that what we expected  The children are moved by the stories and want to learn more and make change.- Grade 9 Teacher Feedback on the Where are the Children exhibition and programming","Glenbow is a member-based, not-for-profit, non-governmental arts and culture organization that is more than an art gallery or museum. For nearly 50 years, a considerable part of Glenbows mandate has been to support and promote regional artists. In addition to developing new exhibitions that focus on western Canadian creativity, we also bring Calgary exciting travelling exhibitions from around the world.Each exhibition season includes a show that explores our art and cultural history collections, to connect our collection with the feature exhibitions and share stories that are meaningful to our diverse community.Each year, approximately 120,000 guests pass through Glenbows doors, including more than 60,000 school children who participate in Glenbows school programs and educational outreach opportunities. Glenbow hosts an ever-changing array of traveling exhibitions focusing on art and culture from around the world. We tell the story of Southern Alberta and the West to thousands of visitors to our city, and we are a major research centre for historians, writers, students, genealogists, filmmakers and media.Glenbow creates experiences that can inspire a lifetime of creative curiosity. In addition to our school programs for students from Kindergarten to grade 12, we also program unique events for adults and for families, to offer our visitors unexpected ways to connect with our exhibitions.Glenbows Collection began with the remarkable vision of petroleum entrepreneur and lawyer Eric Lafferty Harvie. He began collecting material relating to the history of Western Canada in the 1950s, developing an extensive collection of artifacts from North America that tell the fascinating story of Aboriginal peoples, frontier exploration, and the development of western Life. He built on these North American collections with extraordinary artifacts and art from Asia, West Africa, South America, and islands in the Pacific, eventually amassing a huge museum collection. Establishing the Glenbow Foundation in 1954, Mr. Harvies collection became an eclectic blend of western history and international art and artifacts.When Eric Harvie gifted his collection of art and artifacts to the Province of Alberta in 1966, it formed the basis of the Glenbow Museum collection. Through time, the collection has grown  not just in numbers of artifacts  but in strength, focus and importance. Glenbows collection represents the changing history and culture of our city, province and region, and the collection is used daily by students, researchers and visitors to learn, understand and inspire.Glenbows Library and Archives is a major research centre for historians, writers, students, genealogists, filmmakers and media. Glenbows Library holds over 100,000 books, pamphlets, and journals relating to the history of Western Canada, from the time the buffalo roamed the plains to the coming of the railroad, the settlement of the West, and to political, economic, and social events in Alberta today.Glenbows Archives are Canadas largest non-governmental archival repository. It houses a wide-ranging collection of unpublished archival records (such as diaries, letters, minute books, photographs, scrapbooks, speeches, membership lists, films, and sound recordings). The records, which take up five kilometres of shelf space, date from the 1860s to the 1990s, and document not only the people who created them, but also the broader social, political, and economic history of this region. Areas of specialty include First Nations (especially Blackfoot), Mounted Police, pioneer life, ranching and agriculture, the petroleum industry, politics (especially the farmers movement), labour and unions, women, the arts (especially theatre), and businesses.","Education Programs: Glenbows school programs and educational outreach opportunities enrich the lives and learning of over 63,000 Alberta students every year, ranging from Kindergarten to Grade 12. Glenbows educational programs support learning about the history of Alberta while also broadening student knowledge by integrating content from Glenbows art and cultural exhibitions.Glenbows School Programs build upon the learning that occurs in the classrooms. Teachers can book half- or full-day workshops on a multitude of topics, and our educators work with teachers to make cross-curricular connections and impart critical thinking skills to students.Glenbow Museum Schoolclasses spend a whole week at Glenbow studying and experiencing a wide range of exhibitions and information that are linked to the school curriculum. The week-long programs are collaboratively designed by the school teacher and the Museum School coordinator in order to achieve each teachers unique goals and create a dynamic learning experience that is a perfect fit for students.Museokits engage active young minds with a miniature museum-in-a-box. Glenbows 19 different Museokits include objects for display and study, educator notes with student-centered activities and support materials that cover a broad range of curriculum related subjects and grade levels.21st Century Learningis an online resourse that lets teachers bring Glenbow to their classroom with modules and supplemental educational guides developed by our team of curators and educators. 21st Century Learning offers access to hundreds of images and stories from Glenbows collection.

Our goal is tomake the exhibitions come to lifein new ways and give people a shared museum experience thats different from what they get during regular daytime hours.Our talks and tours connect audience with artists and curators and provide opportunities to explore the ideas and stories behind the exhibitions. We also seek out interesting community collaborations for our events, inviting local artists to lead art making workshops, partnering with restaurants to pair art with food and wine, and connecting with other cultural organizations to offer special theatrical performances and film screenings.","As a non-profit, member-based organization, only about 30% of Glenbows funding isprovided by government grants and support. The majority of our operating revenue is generated by admissions and memberships, sales in the museum shop, gallery rentals and fundraising.

"146",807,"Glenbow Ranch Park Foundation","The lands on which Glenbow Ranch Provincial Park sit are stunning. Views of Calgary, the foothills and the Rocky mountains take your breath away. They are also rich in history - Aboriginal communities built their teepees here, buffalo roamed and the once vibrant Glenbow Township thrived here for short time. Sitting between Calgary and Cochrane, these lands could easily be developed into stunning, sought after residential areas. But land owner Tim Harvie and his three sisters Carol (Raymond), Katie and Pauli (Smith) did want to see their lands developed. They wished to honor their father and mothers wishes and preserve these lands for all to enjoy. So they sold these lands at a low cost to the Government of Alberta and with the funds - created the Glenbow Ranch Park Foundation. The Foundation was created to build the infrastructure and programming needed to make this park what it is today. They hoped that the Foundation would always exist to encourage stewardship of the land, support research initiatives, promote park use by all and ultimately grow and development the park with support from other local land owners and the Government. With Tim Harvie still an active board member, their vision remains, and will always remain, at the heart of what we do here at the Foundation.","Glenbow Ranch Park Foundation exists to support Glenbow Ranch Provincial Park, one of Albertas most unique provincial parks. Located along the north shore of the Bow River between Calgary and Cochrane, the park boundaries encompass more than 1,300 hectares of foothills parkland and native grasslands. These surroundings provide fantastic opportunities for the foundation to teach visitors about significant natural features, endangered ecosystems and rare species, archaeological finds such as teepee rings, the historic Glenbow town-site and quarry, and the ranching and industrial history of the region.OUR MISSION: The Glenbow Ranch Park Foundation supports park development and the visitor experience at Glenbow Ranch Provincial Park.OUR VISION: Glenbow Ranch Provincial Park is a pre-eminent destination that inspires all visitors to become stewards of the land .OUR HISTORY: The foundation was established in 2007.

We were created with the belief that a better world is not just possible, but is imperative, and that we must support young leaders if we are to find solutions to our collective challenges. We believe in this mission now, more than ever. In Alberta we also offer The Climate Leadership Program(CLP)a 5-weekend retreat-based course for Alberta residents committed to bringing climate action to their organizations and communities.The Climate Leadership Program was created to address a percieved gap in climate leadership, by building a deeper and broader platform of support within Alberta for climate change action and policy, so that Alberta can become an international leader in climate action. Work is to build a stronger and more diverse network of climate leadership in the Calgary and connect it to provincial climate action efforts.The CLPs programming targets people who are not necessarily current climate leaders, or even focused on climate change in their present work. Through developing climate literacy and leadership skills amongst these participants, Next Up will build a more diverse climate leadership network that will bring conversations and action on climate change into their Calgary communities and organizations.Visible climate leadership from outside the environmental sector (i.e. the usual suspects), is needed to shift the perception that climate change is solely an environmental issue and highlight the ways relevant action can be taken across the province, and by multiple actors. Current approaches to climate solutions are not benefiting from the knowledge and experience held by people who are outside of the traditional sphere of environment, climate policy and action. By increasing the number and diversity of climate focused activists and organizations in Calgary, Next Up will extend the impact of our province wide networks existing 250 grads and 60 engaged presenters and collaborators into new sectors, and contribute to the important work of breaking down those sectors unique challenges.","Today, we face a combination of interconnected global challenges  ecological, economic and social  not seen by previous generations. This moment in time needs bold, smart and determined leadership. We are meeting these challenges through our growing network of social change leaders.Nationally we now have a total of 534 participants and graduates.Calgary has 124 grads and participants, while Edmonton has 110, this includes 26 grads from our inagural Climate Leadership Program.Our alumni are making waves across sectors and issues  from labour, politics, and academia, to arts, service, and grassroots activism. Check out our2016 Alumni Reportfor information on our grads and what they value about Next Up.We are also building connections and capacity within our networks of supporters, partners and collaborators. In our 8 years in Edmonton and 7 years in Calgary, weve had the support of over 100 volunteers each year. We have active relationships with over 100 leaders in nonprofits, labour, indigenous communities, business, health care, education, academia and grassroots organizations. In Calgary we have hosted the Community Connection for 5 years. This is a single day gathering of around 70 people that focuses on community building, project innovation and social networking. A number of notable projects, businesses and collaborations saw their beginings here, including Green Event Services and Calgary Meal Share, while other growing projects and organizations (The Womens Centre, Grain Exchange Coop, Alberta Network of Immigrant Serving Agencies) widened their impact and effectiveness through their participation.Our Network:The particpants from the Climate Leadership Program come from a wide cross section of Albertas people, places, organizations and communities.In Alberta, we partner with Parkland Institute. Parkland Institute is an Alberta-wide, non-partisan research centre situated within the Faculty of Arts at the University of Alberta. Parkland Institute studies economic, social, cultural and political issues facing Albertans and Canadians, using the perspective of political economy.In Calgary we also partner with the Arusha Centre and the Alberta EcoTrust Foundation. The Arusha Centre inspires and supports communities to connect, gather, and create a socially, economically, and environmentally just future. The Alberta EcoTrust Foundation supports environmental groups in Alberta through grants and capacity / collaboration building programs.","There are many takes on the concept of leadership.For us, leadership doesnt necessarily mean that youre a big talker, or that youre the popular person, or the funniest person, or the person who speaks in public a lot. You may have those qualities, or you may not. It does mean that you think about the world around you and you take action to make it a better place.Our goal is to equip participants with the skills and tools needed to become an effective leader.In the Climate leadership Program skills, lenses and theories learned are focused specifically around the challenges and opportunities of climate change. Combined with peer mentoring and the development of innovative climate action projects, grads of the CLP are positioned to influence and transform how climate action is taken in their communities and areas of work.Meet our CLP programming staff.","We are seeking ongoing financial and community support.Donate today.Specifically, we are continually seeking to engage participants from equity seeking groups and those who do not typically have a place in the groups and systems working to address climate change. In particular we are seeking people who have established support and connections within their workplaces, communities, professions, nations or grassroots organizations and wish to bring a climate lens to them. People of colour, indigenous, trades, parents, and cooperative members are but a few examples of people whose participation is vital to the CLPs work. We are continually working to keep our climate action topics and knowlege base current, and actively modify our programming accordingly. We are particulary interested experts from areas that include commnications, innovation and policy who can aid us in developing and expanding spaces for difficult and inclusive conversations and problem solving.In 2017 we wish to bring land based learning, reconcilliation, cooperatives and community based solutions to our programming, and are hopeful to meet people willing to share their knowledge from these areas.","http://nextup.ca","kevin@nextup.ca","860578772RR0001","\N","Kevin Millsip","867000","environ project action film",147,0.0197916666666667,0.0197916666666667,0.0197916666666667,0.0541666666666667,0.0229166666666667,0.635416666666667,0.0322916666666667,0.0135416666666667,0.0291666666666667,0.0416666666666667,0.0229166666666667,0.0166666666666667,0.0416666666666667,0.0135416666666667,0.0166666666666667

Our events average an 80% diversion rate - thats waste that isnt going to the landfill, contributing to greenhouse gases, and requiring tax dollars to manage for decades.EcoStoreOur EcoStore is a social enterprisewhere all theproceeds go right back into providing innovative environmental programs for our homes, communities, workplaces and schools!

"149",607,"Green Fools Theatre Society","8 year-old Baseer is new to Canada. He and his family were forced to flee their home in Syria. For 2 years they lived in poor conditions in a safe house in Lebanon. Arriving in the spring of 2013, the family lost their home in the Calgary floods. It was a difficult adjustment, coping with so much loss and trauma.When Baseer and his brother were chosen to be part of the Green Fools Social Circus Program in July 2013, they were apprehensive, as they did not speak English. The Green Fools Social Circus Program welcomed Baseer and his brother and provided an inclusive, supportive, inspiring, and breakthrough week. Baser and his brother were championed as they braved new experiences, trying out stilt walking, juggling, unicycle and trapeze. The program and the instructors made it possible for the participants to excel at their new skills. This gained confidence and inspired Baseer and his brother to make new friends and overcome fears, all while building a sense of joy and self worth. When Baseers father saw the final performance at the end of the week, he said: My children learned so much from the camp: motivation, self esteem, courage and self confidence. They were so happy at the camp you cannot imagine!Opportunitys that provide inclusion and support are proven to help youth in need become productive and positive members of a community. This work can subvert the possibility of depression, suicide, gang association, or violence. Giving kids a chance makes all the difference in the world.As we take our award winning theatre works and Cirque du Soleil endorsed Social Circus Programs to young people all over the world, we see that the spark of creativity is in everyone. We have worked with youth from Africa to Nunavut desperate to find their place. At Green Fools, we aspire to make social circus a life changing experience, engaging audiences from all walks of life, diverse cultural and socio-economic backgrounds. We create theatre and circus that isnt always bound to a theatre. We bring it to the street, to communities, to schools. Our stilt walkers perform in hand crafted masks and costumes, inspiring so many different people at festivals and events around the world. Our theatre shows have garnered awards and have toured internationally, shining a light on social issues and the enduring spirit of the human heart with our original stories and puppets. Our training opportunities have also earned acclaim and tour worldwide, offering programs in circus skills, puppetry and mask for all levels.The Green Fools believe that a positive arts experience can have a profound effect on an individual or community. It is often difficult to measure but when one experiences communities coming together for a common goal  it can be a catalyst for enormous change. The essence of our theatre shows and our social circus programs are an alternative intervention into the lives of young people who need to be inspired, encouraged and given the opportunity to succeed. Our past experiences implementing social circus projects in remote communities have demonstrated to us that a simple belief in young people gives youth the motivation to believe in themselves. And with the valued support from the greater community we can ensure our most vulnerable youth can and will continue to thrive well into the future.","VisionGreen Fools Theatre aspires to be a central creative hub in which artists of diverse backgrounds continually come together to explore and intertwine circus, theatre, puppetry, mask and physical theatre, manifesting creative works and training programs for the public and other artists.

"151",842,"Heart and Stroke Foundation – Alberta, NWT &  Nunavut","Ethan Deck was about six months old when his parents, Melissa and Irvin realized their little guy wasnt reaching early milestones. He wasnt sitting up. He didnt seem to be using his right arm and hand. After countless appointments with the family doctor, they saw a pediatrician  and with that first CT scan came the diagnosis they werent prepared for. Ethan had suffered a stroke.It might have happened before Ethan was born or soon after. Theres really no way to tell. The family was in shock  they had thought strokes only happened to elderly people. At first, the family was told to expect the worst: that Ethan might never speak, that he might not walk.The next few months were a blur of MRIs, occupational and physiotherapy therapy, fittings for leg and foot orthotics and hand splints. Then in 2010, Melissa saw an article in the local paper about Heart  Stroke-funded researcher Dr. Adam Kirton at the Alberta Childrens Hospital pediatric stroke program. There was a picture of him working with a young stroke survivor to further his rehabilitation  something Ethan really needed. I knew that if I had to go to the hospital with that picture in my hand to track this man down, I would, says Melissa.The Deck family learned that Ethans situation wasnt actually all that unique: pediatric stroke  either in the womb or in the first 28 days of life  occurs once in every 4,000 live births.Within three months, Ethan and Melissa were meeting regularly with Dr. Kirton and have been working with him ever since, trying to build new pathways in Ethans brain. For example, Ethans left arm was casted from fingertip to elbow to force him to use his affected right side. This built new pathways in Ethans brain until it became automatic for him to go to his right side.Dr. Kirtons clinical trials, which are a bit like day camps, are all about improving the motor function of children affected by stroke. The imaging technology he uses to map the brain helps his team develop new treatment options for children  and so far the results are really promising. Kids are gaining mobility, independence and confidence, and this work is leading to further research, education and support systems for children and their parents.I think if theres a message for Canadians in Ethans story, its this: stroke can happen to a person of any age, and research is tremendously important, says Melissa.

At the University of Calgary, Dr. Paul Fedaks research, with funding from the Heart and Stroke Foundation, is looking at repairing damaged tissues in the heart muscle after a heart attack. His research could be a game-changer for many of the 600,000 Canadians living with heart failure.Peer support: Heart  Stroke is actively working to connect Canadians living with heart disease and stroke so they can learn from and support each other in their journeys. For example, the Heart  Stroke Community of Survivors Facebook group was established to provide a forum where Canadians can share experiences, quality information and tips for life after a diagnosis, a stroke or a cardiac event. Members find social and emotional support in a safe, inclusive and respectful community.

She was so mistrustful of her guardians that she kept her pregnancy a secret until that Christmas Eve, when as a confused and scared 16-year-old she lay in a cold bathtub and gave birth to her son Noah. She cut the umbilical cord with kitchen scissors, wrapped Noah in a towel and tried to clean herself up. Thankfully she texted a friend and that friend called an ambulance.But that isnt the worst part  when she left the hospital the next day she was alone, penniless and had nowhere for her and Noah to sleep. Fortunately, she found hope at Highbanks.We moved Kate and Noah into a furnished two-bedroom apartment and in two years she completed high school and received a scholarship to Mount Royal University.Kate now has a fulfilling job in her field as a Director of Marketing for a Calgary based company. As a young woman who credits Highbanks for her success she, and our 70 graduates like Kate, tell us that Highbanks changed the trajectory of their life and improved lives of their children.To read more stories of how Highbanks has helped families, see our website.","Of the 500+ teens who give birth in Calgary every year, some have the support of families to help them with the challenge of raising a child; many have no one.

They were quiet and hesitant about joining us, but decided to stay for the lesson and the meal that we would cook together that day. After a few short weeks, they were the first to arrive, never missing a day and looking forward to seeing the new friends they had made. The boy quickly developed a bond with baby Maya  another regular - and their mothers began helping each other with carpooling and cooking dinner. Elizabeth and her son were both eager to try out the new skills they were learning at home, they even grew sprouts to share with the group. The group bonded over the chance to talk about their traditional foods from home as well as leaning more about Canadian foods. At the end of the program, Elizabeth and her son were excited about the confidence they had developed to cook and enjoy healthy food here in Canada. They continue to meet with their new friends from the group and are eager for the next session to start up.The Food Skills Cooking Group is one of six Community Food Programs offered at the HSCA, information about them can be found here.In addition to the Community Food Program, the HSCA offers a wide range of programs and services aimed at meeting the diverse needs of community members.---OUR HISTORY | Hillhurst Sunnyside Community Association exists to provide services that enhancequality of life for residents in the Calgary neighbourhoods of Hillhurst andSunnyside.

"156",303,"HomeFront Society for the Prevention of Domestic Violence","My story is one of perseverance and strength.I married Brian, the man of my dreams, and quickly found out I made a mistake. My life was a fairy-tale alright, just one told from the side of the villain. I felt trapped, yet mesmerized by a type of magic that held me there  really it was wanting to believe that he could change and that things would be different.With frequent beatings and never being good enough, I endured and existed with each day eating away at my self-confidence and self-worth.In 2010, the beating was particularly severe so I called 911. From this call, I was connected with HomeFront and this is when my life started to change.I wasnt ready to leave at this time, but HomeFront stayed with me  checking in with me to see if I was safe, and listening to where I was and what I needed. At first, Brians power and control over me seemed to dictate my future and I had trouble seeing a life without him.In 2012, the beatings escalated  only now I was pregnant. For the first time I felt a sense of panic and urgency  I needed this child to be safe and the only way was to leave. HomeFront was there to help me create a safety plan and relocate to another province. I still keep in touch with HomeFront as they continue to listen, support me and help me stay safe.I had a baby boy. Im a happy, independent mom and a woman who feels dignified and respected.HomeFronts support opened my eyes to a life free from abuse. With HomeFront, I began to believe in myself and honour the strength I now realize I always had. I am grateful to HomeFront. Best of all, Im raising my son in a safe and healthy home, and together we are living our very own happily ever after. Thank you, HomeFront!----- HISTORY |In 1990, representatives from a variety of community organizations within the domestic violence sector got together to form the Mayors Task Force on Community and Family Violence.This project brought together 60 community groups within the sector with the common goal of launching a specialized domestic violence court in Calgary. By 2000, Calgary instated Albertas first specialized domestic court. Thirteen years later, the program is still around and is still committed to ensuring perpetrators take accountability for their actions. Today this program is known as HomeFront.HomeFront was one of the first organizations to bring together all of the individuals and organizations connected to the justice system. Initially, HomeFront supported 1,000 perpetrators and the individuals theyd victimized. Today, HomeFront has more than 30 staff members, 20 volunteers and a $3.5 million budget.HomeFronts committed partners and dedicated employees continually strive to instate different programs that address the needs of all individuals affected by domestic violence.Within the last year, HomeFront has focused on expanding its Domestic Conflict Response Team, which provides intervention and referral service for individuals dealing with chronic or high-risk incidents of domestic violence where charges have not been laid.The High Risk Management Initiative, which provides risk assessment, risk management and intense intervention strategies for high-risk cases, is also in the process of expanding. Soon these programs will be serving the entire city.","HomeFront is creating safe communities by eliminating domestic violence through direct client services, justice coordination, and facilitating community action. At our core, HomeFront is based on collaboration. We work alongside the courts, judges, lawyers, police, child services, shelters and local treatment agencies to ensure victims and their families have the opportunity to move their lives in a positive and healthy direction and break the cycle of abuse.VISION | Together with our partners, HomeFront is working towards a common vision to significantly reduce the incidence and repeat nature of domestic violence in Calgary.IMPACT | We are an integrated part of the justice system, and since the inception of HomeFront, domestic violence re-offence rates in Calgary have been cut in half and victim engagement in the justice process has more than doubled. Victims are safer, offenders are being held accountable, and families are being given their best chance at a future free of domestic violence.Over the last ten years, HomeFront has changed the lives of more than 25,000 victims and their children. Together, we can achieve a society free of domestic violence where everyone has the opportunity to realize their full potential.-Kevin McNichol, Executive Director - HomeFrontHIGHLIGHTS |In 2013, more than 1,186 adults and 545 children were assisted by the Domestic Conflict Response Team. All of these familiesreport they are now living free of domestic violence and 88% report the cessation or reduction in family conflict. Within the last fiscal year, the Specialized DomesticViolence Court Program supported 2,129 victims and 2,422 accused were served.","HomeFront has two unique programs that work in collaboration with our partners to provide wrap around support victims and their families and ultimately save lives:The Domestic Conflict Response Team (DCRT) collaborates with the Calgary Police Service and Calgary and Area Child and Family Services to identify families who are at-risk of further incidents of domestic violence. Generally in these cases, calls have been made to the police, but no charges were laid. The Domestic Conflict Response Team works with families in their homes to provide early intervention in order to interrupt the cycle of abuse at its early stages. They help connect families to the proper resources and referrals for community services and treatment programs, provide safety planning, and any other supports they might require to improve safety and prevent future incidents of domestic violence.The Domestic Violence Intervention and Resource Team (DVIRT)supports victims of domestic violence after charges are laid and the case is entering the justice system. Case Managers provide wrap around support to victims to:Help them understand the court proceedings.Ensure their interests are considered in court decisions.Develop effective safety planning.Connect victims to resources in the community.Follow-up with victims until probation orders end and clients safety is optimized.The DVIRT works closely with the High Risk Management Initiative (HRMI), which provides risk assessment, risk management and intense intervention strategies for high-risk offenders and their victims. This service is a partnership with Alberta Health Services, Calgary and Area Child and Family Services Authority, Calgary Counselling Centre, Calgary Police Service, Community Corrections, and YWCA Sheriff King Home.---EVALUATION |Since its inception, HomeFront has pursued the collection of data to monitor its inputs, outputsand outcomes - this data ensures HomeFront holds itself, its programs, and the systems itspans accountable. In this way, we demonstrate to our clients and stakeholders, we not only walkthe talk, we are walking the walk. In 2013, HomeFront supported more than 3,500 clients and collected more than 500 points ofdata on them and the activities related to the services those clients received. From this data, we can tell you what we have learned:13% of our clients identified themselves as Aboriginal.As a group, Aboriginal clients were 40% less likely to wish their perpetrator to go to jail (10%vs. 16%) and were more likely to identify alcohol (25%) and anger management (25%) asprimary concerns in their relationships.On average, it takes about 132 days (median of 81 days) to resolve a domestic violence case.Cases of Aboriginal clients appear to take less time toresolve  an overall average of 139 as compared to 149 days for other groups.

The right home, with the right support, has given him a second chance. A severe anxiety attack left Bob hospitalized for seven weeks, broken and uncomfortable in his own skin. A successful businessman for 25 years, he had it all  a beautiful wife and son, a magnificent home, a Mercedes. He was the last person anyone expected to fall apart. The anxiety attack changed his life forever.While Bob was in the hospital, his wife drained every last cent from their bank accounts and vanished, leaving him with only his car, his stereo and a chair. He tried to go back to work after his release but the pressure of his prominent position was too steep a hill for him to climb without proper support.He didnt eat or sleep. He wore the same dark suit to work every day for weeks and would rarely bathe. A heavy cloud of paranoia and depression hung over him. By this time he had attempted suicide on three occasions. After a year and half, he was fired.The decrepit apartment Bob rented was filthy. He had no money, no food and was facing eviction. His sister began to fly in from Toronto every two weeks and, slowly, she helped him rebuild his life. He began seeing a psychiatrist and going to group sessions. Through his Canadian Mental Health Association support worker, he discovered Bob Ward Residence, a building owned and managed by Horizon Housing Society for tenants with mental health challenges, physical disabilities and people living below the poverty line.Living here has given me the opportunity to find myself again. This place has the support I need, Bob says. His neighbours have become like an extended family. I know Jess [Building Manager for Bob Ward Residence] will knock on my door if he hasnt seen me in a few days and make sure Im OK.Im grateful to have a safe place to come home to when Im feeling overwhelmed, Bob says, pulling out the key to his apartment and holding it up proudly.

At the time, my oldest daughter, Lynn, wasfour and my youngest daughter, Katie, was one. Our lives were turned upside down that day, and changed forever.Looking back, I can honestly say that the first two years after Dianes passing were a blur. I was in survival mode - running around at 100 mph, trying to work full time, run a household and be both mom and dadfor my girls. I was especially worried about Lynn and how her moms passing would affect her, as she was old enough to know exactly what had happened to her mom. I knew I needed to seek counselling for her immediately - thank goodness for Hospice Calgary!Today we are doing well. Weve come a long way in the last four years - thanks to Hospice Calgary. Sure, there are still tough days when we miss Diane dearly. But what the Hospice has taught us is its okay to have those days - its natural.

Thiscombined with a commitment to integrity, collaboration, trust and accountability. Simply put, we care.Our founder, and continuing inspiration, William Roper Hull, was an entrepreneur, visionary and philanthropist. His contributions to Calgary, the province of Alberta and western Canada left a blueprintof good citizenship for legions of others to emulate.He said in 1883 of Calgary, There will be a city of at least 25,000. I see houses, schools, shops and churches and everything one needs for a happy life and I will help to build it.Mr. Hull recognized that a good life requires a fabric of services, resources and relationships. Because of William Roper Hulls generosity, thousands of kids, young adults and families are helped every day through Hull Services.In 2016 we continue to strive toward the highest of ideals while remainingsteadfast in the belief that every child, every family, matters.","Atthe core of Hull Services approach isthe Neurosequential Model of Therapeutics (NMT).NMT is a developmentally-informed, biologically-respectful approach to working with at-risk children. The Neurosequential Model is not a specific therapeutic technique or intervention; it is a way to organize a childs history and current functioning. The goal of this approach is to structure assessment of a child, the understandingof the primary problems, identification of key strengths and the application of interventions (educational, enrichment and therapeutic) in a way that will help family, educators, therapists and related professionals best meet the needs of the child.Following more than two years of intensive certification and thousands of personnel hours dedicated to master the core concepts and implement the Neurosequential Model of Therapeutics (NMT) in their clinical setting, Hull Services was invited to become a Flagship Site for the ChildTrauma Academy (CTA)in the Neurosequential Model of Therapeutics. In fact were Canadas only flagship location for NMT.Based in Houston, Texas, CTA has created a network of partner organizations across the world certified in the use of the NMT as recognition of an ongoing relationship with the CTA and the continuing demonstration of the intention to engage in extensive internal and external NMT related training, supervision, consultation and community engagement activities.Commenting on Hull Services, Dr. Bruce D. Perry, Senior Fellow and founder of CTA said, Theyve done some incredibly innovative things and were learning from them, I suspect, as much as they are learning from us, so its been a really interesting and productive partnership and so much so that we have named Hull a flagship program for NMT and theyre one of the primary program development and clinical partners with the CTA in this process. There probably are a handful of places in the world that have the combination of staff who understand kids like [Hull does] and school that understand kids like [Hull does].","Hull Services provides an integrated continuum of programs and services including specialized therapy, counselling and education.

"161",695,"I Can for Kids Foundation","I never expected to find myself in a situation where having food would be a concern. My family and I have been through a whole lot in the last four months and sometimes in this journey I have found that we need extra help with food, clothing or basic items. We have been lucky enough to benefit from the I Can for Kids program, this program has saved us more than once. I do not know how we would have made it, especially through the summer, without I Can for Kids. They drop off with a friendly smile and a bag of food to help us get through the week. What more could I ask! Thank you I Can for Kids, I will never forget how you have helped my family! -Brenda Strafford Centre clientSchool nutrition programs play a critical role in helping children build healthy minds and bodies. A meal received at school may be a hungry childs only meal of the day.Sadly, the majority of kids who count on these programs during the school year dont have the same access to a free meal during the summer. The resulting hunger can have an overwhelming effect on their physical, emotional and social health, and delay their academic performance by up to two months at the start of the school year.Whether affected by a job loss, a health crisis, or escaping a life of abuse, thousands of Calgarians struggle to put food on the table every day. To make matters worse, few options exist to provide food to hungry kids during the summer. Local agencies are limited in their programming, resources and hours of operation, and are not able to provide food to children consistently, or in amounts lasting more than a few days.I Can for Kids and our community partners are working hard to ensure children and youth across the city receive the supports and resources they need. Together, we provide food packs to hungry kids in high-risk, low-income areas in Calgary to help them get the nutrition they need to learn, play and grow over the summer months, preparing them for a healthier start to the school year.","We deliver child-friendly food packs, each accounting for three meals and two snacks, to food insecure children and youth right in their own neighborhoods to end summer childhood hunger in our community.Hunger affects everything we do. We have a harder time concentrating, we dont feel good, were less active, and we behave differently. For people, skipping a meal is hard enough, but for kids who rely on being fed at school, summer hunger can have a devastating impact on their physical, emotional and social health, and delay their academic performance by up to two months at the start of the school year. For over 3,500 Calgary kids who rely on school nutrition programs everyday,summer will be their hardest and hungriest time of the year.Over the past year, Calgary school nutrition programs have seen up to a 30% increase in children needing support, a crucial indicator of the number of kids who will need food supports during the summer. With the help of our generous supporters, I Can for Kids hopes to provide 36,000 meals to hungry kids in Calgary this summer.In collaboration with a number of respected community partners, we reach some of the most vulnerable kids in Calgary - children in single parent low-income households, kids who have recently escaped domestic violence, and homeless youth as young as 12 years old. Our partners include:Calgary Housing CompanyCommunity Kitchen Program of CalgaryThe Brenda Strafford CentreWoods HomesBoys and Girls Clubs of CalgaryThe Alex Youth Health CentreCornerstone Youth CentreHull ServicesWomen In Need SocietyFamilies MatterBowwest Community Resource CentreCaryaOUR RESULTS:Last summer we provided 30,000 meals to hungry kids across the city.We are the only agency in Calgary providing this service.","I Can for Kids prides itself on a simple and efficient business model that bares little financial risk, while delivering a critical service to thousands of vulnerable kids in the community.Step 1: YOUR GIFTIt all starts with the generosity of our corporate sponsors, donors and grant funders to support our program, as well as a dedicated team of volunteers who give manage all aspects of the organization and program delivery.Step 2: PARTNERSHIPSNext, we build partnerships with food manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers and encourage them to donate groceries for our food packs, or leverage their buying power to purchase inventory at a significantly reduced cost.Step 3: ASSEMBLE  STORE FOOD PACKSThen during the spring months, we collect and safely store our inventory at our warehouse. Its there where we engage groups of volunteers to join us in assmembing our food packs.Step 4: BUILD DISTRIBUTION CHANNELSWhile we keep busy preparing our food packs, we also work hard to build distribution channels with community and agency partners. Our partners are key in helping us reach the hungriest kids in Calgary.Step 5: PURCHASE A $5 CHILD-FRIENDLY FOODPACKDuring the month of May, we run a special campaign through Calgary Save On Foods stores by selling our food packs to their customers to donate to hungry kids in our city. For those who cant make it to a Save On Foods store, donations are accepted online all year long.Step 6: FOOD PACKS ARE DISTRIBUTED TO HUNGRY KIDSFinally, when school ends, we get busy delivering our food packs to hungry kids in high-risk, low-income areas in our city until the start of the school year.Since we believe nothing should stand in the way of a hungry child getting the support they need, we do not require recipient children or their parents to endure a lengthy, income-based application process in order to receive our support. This process often presents barriers, and associated stigmas prevent many families from accessing the resources their children desperately need. Instead, simply based on the childs living situation and their qualification to receive support from our partner agencies, I Can for Kids provides them with the food supports they need in a non-judgemental, barrier-free environment.But its more than a meal.Working to address the challenges that result in poverty and food insecurity is imporant to us. We actively participate in a number of collaborations with agencies who advocate for long-term strategies that address the root causes of poverty, such as Vibrant Communities Calgary - stewards of Enough for All, Calgarys poverty reduction strategy.Together, we endeavor to enrich, empower and inspire every young life we touch, and build a community where no child goes hungry.","Food is fuel.

It began with volunteer staff in an office space donated by Mount Royal College and was the first incorporated settlement agency in the Calgary area. In 1981 and 1982 following increased funding from the government, CIAS began advocating for more ethno-cultural staff in mainstream agencies. Additionally, they began expanding public education and outreach activities and with an emphasis on providing first language supportive counseling to new immigrants.n 1997, as part of its 20th anniversary celebration, the Calgary Immigrant Aid Society launched the first Immigrants of Distinction Awards (IDA) with Dr. Martha Cohen, Order of Canada, as the Honorary Chair. The Immigrants of Distinction Awards continue to this day, recognizing the diverse talents among newcomers to Canada as well as celebrating diversity in the workplace. These awards exemplify the agencys commitment to promote the benefits of a diverse society.

"163",270,"Inn from the Cold","Patricia*, mother of five, had a very difficult upbringing filled with trauma, addiction, and abuse.Her children have been apprehended by Child and Family Services three times throughout their lives. Patricia was in an extremely abusive relationship and addicted to alcohol. It was time to change.Determined to create a better life for herself and her five children, Patricia found the courage to leave this abusive relationship and address her own problems with alcohol. She and her children came to Calgary to find a better life... With the Inns facilitation, Patricia completed a residential treatment program for alcoholism, numerous parenting courses, extensive counselling, and she experienced a lot of personal growth. Her children were returned to her care andthis family is doing well in a home of their own.Patricia started school in September 2014 and hopes to become a youth worker. She recently remarried; her childrens stepfather is described as a supportive, wonderful guy who has stable employment.This family no longer has ANY involvement with Child and Family Services at all  practically unheard of! We are happy to see this brave family living the life they deserve. In helping to provide a safe and affordable home, your support will give many other families, like Patricias, the opportunity to break the cycle of poverty and homelessness, and to rebuild their lives in a new home.*name changed for privacy purposesWhen families arrive at the Inn, they are scared, uncertain and hungry. They come at all hours of the day and night, with little more than they can carry and occasionally, with only their pajamas as clothing. Inn from the Cold staff jump to action immediately. After the registration and assessment process is complete, the family transitions to their sleeping accommodations in our emergency family shelter. They are given new clothing, toiletries, blankets, sheets and each child is given a toy. And this is only the very beginning of the support that we offer familiesDuring the bitterly cold winter of 1996/7, St. Stephens Anglican Church opened its doors to provide shelter and hope to Calgarys homeless families and others in need. In October 2008, Inn from the Cold opened Calgarys first Emergency Family Shelter, located in the heart of the Beltline community. For families going through the stress and trauma of being homeless or who are at imminent risk of homelessness, the Inn offers the programs and supports required so they can begin to stabilize and rebuild their lives.","Our mission is to provide emergency shelter, support and programs to homeless children, their families and others in need, with the goal of building healthy, stable families and ending homelessness. Our vision is a community where no family is homeless. We are our communitys response to families in need of support, housing and hope during times of crisis. Our priority is to help families find safe, affordable and appropriate housing.In 2014, over 2,200 individuals have sought shelter services at the Inn, of which 1,244 were children. This statistic reveals a drastic 130% increase in the demand for services over 2013. For the hundreds of families seeking shelter at the Inn, there is simply nowhere else to go. The need for support is greater than ever before.The growth of family homelessness provincially and nationally has been a central issue for planning, discussion, and response since 2011, but a number of significant contextual factors have contributed to moving this from concern to crisis. There are many reasons why Calgary families become homeless, but lack of affordable, appropriate housing is the leading cause. Rising cost of living, divorce, job-loss, physical and mental health issues, generational cycles, vulnerable populations, abuse and addictions can all be contributing factors. Every story is different, but enhanced assessments delivered through a new assessment and triage program indicate that a majority of our guests are high acuity, suffering from a complexity of needs that have led them and their families to become homeless.Of the families served in 2014, 75% of guests were first-time shelter users and 12% of respondents identified as chronically homeless.","We offer shelter to children and families, and develop programs that aim to bring an end to the vicious cycle of homelessness. We support guests and their children to take important steps towards creating better futures by engaging them in intensive case management services and onsite programming. These programs range from an onsite Student Run Clinic to the Early Childhood Development program, which intervenes at an early stage to help stop homeless children from becoming homeless adults.As Calgarys original and largest emergency family shelter, we provide critical frontline services  intervention, including:24/7 emergency family shelter;a community-based emergency shelter program;coordinated  specialized onsite programming; andinnovative assessment and case management services not duplicated elsewhere.Family homelessness is a serious and complex issue. As front-line service providers, we understand the unique challenges and risks that homeless families encounter. In consort with the Calgary Homeless Foundations (CHF) 10 Year Plan to End Homelessness, we are working with community partners and colleagues to reduce these risks, create new strategies and ensure services are not duplicated.In assessing and triaging clients to determine appropriate services within IFTC and also appropriate referrals to service provision partners out in the community, we seek to ensure highest standard of service, safety, and security for both clients and staff/volunteers. Frequently the severity and complexity of issues faced by the family goes far beyond simply not having a home and therefore the supports need to be equal to addressing those. Predominant challenges identified through assessment processes include:Severe mental health diagnoses or indicatorsSignificant developmental delays and/or cognitive impairmentActive addictionsSevere physical health diagnoses or contagious conditionsSerious physical disabilitiesActive domestic violence or threat of retaliation due to leaving a domestic conflictCriminal historyActive investigation for child abuse/neglect (CFSA)Due to the holistic and ongoing support we provide after placing families in permanent housing, Inn from the Cold has one of the lowest recidivism rates in Calgary. We are constantly working to develop and innovate best practice methods to not only place our families into homes, but also to support them to stay in their home and not fall back into the cycle of homelessness.","Volunteering to serve suppers and lunches at Inn From The Cold has made my daughters learn that homelessness can happen to anyone and homeless people arent different.

It wasnt his cerebral palsy making his life so hard, it was the terrible abusive relationship hed found himself in with a High School friend. Isolated and afraid, every day life was scary. Mike escaped, but the isolation followed him. After a dark year shuttered away from the rest of the city Mike discovered a community waiting to embrace him. It was a new found passion for performing that finally brought Mike out of his darkness, and joining Inside Out gave him entry into Calgarys rich, accepting, and entertaining theatre community.This was decades ago, and Mike is now a fixture at Inside Out and one of Calgarys most dedicated theatre fans. The chance to act, to play on stage gave Mike the confidence and support to live life fully.Not everyone of our participants brings with them the trauma that Mike does, but every participant is looking for a place to belong, and Inside Out is here to be that place for them.","Theatre for Every BodyInside Out Theatre is Calgarys Mixed Ability Theatre Company.

A review by the Joyful Magpie website describes the show as theatre for the soul, and goes on to say:As Keirs story grows larger in its scope, so too does the connection between audience and storyteller. We become involved in this story that is, at times, difficult, but nonetheless engrossing. Keir captures our attention with his frankness, along with his sense of humour. And that humour is a reflection of Keirs belief that telling a story enough times weakens it. In other words, telling these stories is Keirs way of overcoming the experiences that have had far-reaching effects on his life.And so, we remember that the stage can mean many different things to many different people. Here, Keirs stage is one of healing, transformation  moving on.Mike, Karen, Karen, Mike: A Soap Operais theatre for the soul.","Our theatre education programs range from introductory drama classes to music and voice groups to our Point of View Ensemble, our advanced play creation group.

Over the last couple of years we have devised world premieres that explore the love lives of adults with disabilities, created a staged memoir of one of our long time members, and a mystery-farce revolving around a contested will, secret diamonds, and pizza (lots of pizza).Were committed to investing in the development of artists with disabilities. In addition to the more than a hundred artists we work with annually through our classes and productions were proud to announce our inaugural Playwright-in-Residence where we will develop and premiere a new play written by a writer with a disability. Our first ever Playwright-in-Residence Elain is busily working on an adaptation of Beauty and the Beast. Her play sees a disabled woman claim the term Beast for herself and explores what its like to fall in love with someone while knowing that because of how you look it would take a miracle for them to return your love. We will develop The Beautiful Beast over the coming year and will produce the world premiere in 2017.","Inside Out Theatre faces one of the best challenges a charity can have; the demand for our programming is overwhelming our capacity.

"165",501,"Islamic Information Society of Calgary","After a conference a young man from a war-torn country came to one of our spiritual leaders and complained about how helpless he felt with all of the turmoil in the world, especially his home country. He felt descriminated against at school due to his skin color. He felt as if he was always under suspicion due to his faith, especially when he travelled.He didnt have anyone to talk to, and felt even if he did he would be completely misunderstood. The only solution he could find was to join an extremist group over-seas that claimed he would feel safe and was fighting to make the world a better place.More than a year goes by and this young man is a faded memory until he reaches out once again to thank us for saving his life. He didnt end up joining an extremist group, but rather focused on finishing his education and learning more about his faith at the same time.In his words:If it wasnt for you I would have joined an extremist group and would probably be dead.","The Islamic Information Society of Calgary (IISC) is a spiritual bastion to thousands of Muslims on a weekly basis. We focus on religious education that helps people navigate through the trials of life, and empowers them to make more God-conscience decisions.In a post 9/11 world Muslims often come under scrutiny for not promoting voices of moderation from within, and that is exactly what the IISC strives to be. A voice of moderation for all Muslims in Calgary specifically, and Canada in general. Through our outreach programs non-Muslims are able to learn more about the faith of Islam, which leads to their Muslim colleagues feeling better understood at school and work.As the Calgary Muslim community continues to grow so has the demand for social services from within the Muslim community. This comes in the form of helping the poor and needy, to providing counseling, toproviding a safe space where Muslims can come and discuss whats on their mind without fearing judgment. Thats for God to do - not us :)2015 Highlights:In the Islamic month of Ramadan (June/July) of 2015 the IISC fed over 6000 people in their two location as a part of their iftar (break your fast) initative. The largest number to date!On September 26th 2015, the IISC volunteer group in collaboration withthe Community of Forest Lawn, Antyx Community Arts and Parks FoundationCalgary, went to a park in Forest Lawn by 43rd street and 10th SE tolandscape the park, as well as plant trees. 9 trees, 25 shrubs and 125herbaceous plants were planted all together.On November 6th 2015, the IISC organized a movie screening of Tug ofWar written by and featuring Boonaa Mohammed. The event also featured apresentation by the Redirect program, an initiative by the Calgarypolice service to help youth at risk. The event concluded with an honestand open discussion by the Muslim community on what was on their mindswith regards to radicalization.On International Human Rights Day, December 10th 2015, the IISC was asked to host a diversity and sensitivity training for the Calgary Police Service, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Calgary Fire Brigade, and EMS. It was our first time ever hosting an event like this but it was still an absolutely amazing experience for us. To be able to discuss our faith with people that are willing to sacrifice their lives for the protection and safety of this country was priceless.","With a focus on education the Islamic Information Society of Calgary provides the following:Friday Prayer ServicesDaily classes on how to read and memorize the Quran (the Muslim holy scripture)Weekly religious classes in the evening (Which are recorded and put online here: https://goo.gl/zSIHIy)Quarterly Seminars on topics relavant to the needs of Canadian MuslimsAn annual conference that aspires to unite the community, empower them with knowledge, and leave them feeling great about themselves.On the social services front the IISC provides:Mentoring groups for boys and girlsMonthly food baskets for those in needPre-Marital counseling for those looking to get marriedSpiritual counseling for those just having a tough time with life.Monthly volunteer initiatives at the Calgary Drop-in CentreYearly city wide clean up.In the capacity of Outreach the IISC provides:Islam Awareness daysFree literature to those that express interestRepresentation at major institutes (previously at S.A.I.T. and currently at the Calgary Police Service)","Whether Muslim or Non-Muslim, the Islamic Information Society of Calgary would like you to be a part of something greater than yourself.

"166",608,"Jack Long Foundation for Community Development","It all started at a community meeting many years ago. I remember that uncomfortable moment of silence, followed by the buzz after the public resignation of the board chair of my community association. I had never chaired a meeting in my life and here I was expected to bridge what can only be described as The Great Divide. Not knowing what to do, I took the chair, only to have a small but vocal group call for the resignation of the board. How was I to deal with a fractured board and a community under social pressure? But, there they were my neighbours, real people passionate about their community unexpected allies.Amongst them, those unafraid to feel, dream and act, was Jack Long, a well-known architect, planner and community activist. Jack gave me the courage to trust the community, to give considerate thought and act with compassion.The result, the community banded together to find their unique solutions to complex social issues. In dealing with prostitution they decided to help women trapped in the lifestyle, while police enforced the law. In dealing with inflated property taxes they banded together to help those who could lose their homes by launching a group appeal. I found that given the proper support, the community acted with empathy and creativity. Those were exciting and powerful times that confirmed the remarkable capacity of caring for each other in community life.A few years later, in my role as a church group volunteer, I met real people facing homelessness, like the hard working Perrez family, who immigrated here for a better life but were constantly confronted with making ends meet to keep an apartment that they could barely afford. Inspired by Jacks strong belief in the power of ordinary people living in community, I turned to him to help. As always, he was eager to help, but sadly he passed away a few months later. The Jack Long foundation was founded to honour him and to harness Jacks belief in the power of community. Our goal was to make affordable housing a part of the neighbourhood fabric, to develop process that addressed homelessness and marginalization from a community perspective. Inspired by Jacks philosophy, and in his words we develop within that community the capacity to plan for itself.We ran an experiment with one community, and it worked! A group of concerned people eagerly looked at the opportunities within their own community. They saw real people, not demographics. They saw Hazel who, at 80 years of age, would not find affordable housing within her community (that would meet her need for elder support). And they felt the loss when even one person was forced to leave because they could no longer afford to live there. They were able to see existing needs within their own community, and put a face to those desperately seeking the basic need for a home. THE RESULT: ELDERHOUSE, an innovative solution to ageing-in-place.Naming the problem was not enough. We asked seniors themselves to help us develop a dignified, affordable, and respectful housing model, which allows them to age in their own neighbourhood. Why? Because we are serious about real solutions, and because real people tell us that studies  reports are not enough real people need real homes. And real homes are supported by real communities.","...there is an infinity of possible viewpoints but the only one that can be said to be proper​​ is the standpoint, or viewpoint of the community itself.- Jack Long 1925-2001 Jack truly lived his philosophy and had a profound impact on the face of Calgary in his roles as architect, planner, city councillor, and community activist over his four decade career. Avenue Magazine stated Its hard to find anyone else whos had such a profound impact on the face of Calgary in the second half of the 20th century. Jack was a visionary who was responsible for the design of the Calgary Science Centre (1966); he was awarded the Canadian Design Council Concrete Awards Program. The building remains relevant and is in the running to house Calgarys New Contemporary Art Gallery. Always compassionate, Jack was named Honorary Chief of the Stoney Indian Tribe due to his respect and work for aboriginal causes. Never shrinking from controversy, Jack successfully helped battle CP Rail in their attempt to relocate the railway tracks to run along the Bow River and along Princes Island.His passion for community activism helped community residents realize that they are responsible for the destiny of their neighbourhoods. He is well known for his work in his home community of Inglewood, which widely engaged community residents in planning for the redevelopment of their community as it faced its demise in the late 60s and 70s. Jack steadfastly fought for and defended the communitys right to affect its own future stating To use the community viewpointThis means the planning becomes a participational planning process, utilizing the viewpoint of Every Man the Planner. Every Man the Planner was the title Jacks Masters Thesis, which documented his unique work with Inglewood residents. His legacy lives on with the Jack Long Foundation (JLF).JLF conducts a unique, Affordable Housing Planning Process that is community based. Stakeholders bring critical community knowledge to the table. JLF programs engage individuals and facilitate collaborative relationships with like-minded community organisations.Vision: To to work with individual communities to develop their unique strategy for building affordable housing within their boundaries. We believe in the power of a community coming together as a collective to identify opportunities and resources, address internal needs, and in turn make the city a better place. We make things happen. When we say community we see belonging - not geography. We see hope - not powerlessness. We see living - not occupancy. We work with real people in real communities to get affordable housing built according to their plan.Mission: To encourage, support, and build projects and processes, which promote social and ethical responsibility, build healthy environments, and develop dynamic and balanced urban communities in which all community residents have the opportunity to participate and contribute.","I. PLANWe deliver a unique planning process for affordable housing that is community based. Stakeholders bring critical community knowledge to the table. JLF programs engage individuals and facilitate collaborative relationships with like-minded community organisations. Face-to-Face Shoulder-to-Shoulder... It begins with a conversation. Every community has the resources and the ability to affect change. The JLF process initiates change; we bring together all stakeholders and interested parties and help them devise THEIR plan. We tailor meetings to identify objectives and opportunities; address community issues; and write THEIR community plan. Good plans lead to action. Weve tested the process and are moving forward We started several years ago by running a pilot with one community. They talked. We listened. They saw a lack of housing for seniors in need of daily support. This was no surprise. They worried about seniors living unsafely in their homes beyond their capacity to do so.NEW!!!                                                                                  We are working with East Village Seniors to take an active look to the future!We have launched a consultation with East Village seniors. Why East Village?          East Village has possibly the highest concentration of seniors with a 3-4 block radius. It all started with a conversation over lunch with a few committed people. They shared their ideas on what they would like to see in the next phase of their lives. It was no surprise to see that belonging, dignity, and living in community were forefront in their values. They most welcomed the opportunity to share their opinions and insights. We wondered who else should we ask if not seniors themselves!II. BUILDWe sought expert advice from seniors themselves. They said, Dont take away our choices. We decided to take on the challengeElderhouse A fresh approach. Elderhouse is our newest challenge. We are set to build a shared home, designed by seniors for seniors something that belongs in every community. Its more than a building - its about people and caring relationships, private spaces, lots of light, a friendly atmosphere, nutrition, and healthy living. A different perspective - a focus on healthy living and not simply managing health conditions. Its about people not beds. Its not about the number of beds. Thats for hospitals. Its a shared home. Its personal. Elderhouse is designed to build relationships, combat loneliness, and its about belonging. Seniors are valuable; they have much to contribute; their home must be part of and open to the community. Its about community. Local residents are given priority.The first Elderhouse is being planned for Inglewood. WE HAVE LAND. LETS BUILD IT!III. ASSIST - Neighbour-To-NeighbourWhat happens with the Honey Do List when there is no Honey to do it? Were trying something new! It takes a village We are launching a community fix-it program. Its simple. Seniors request help with small chores, we organize a team of volunteers and a work day, to get the work done.","ELDERHOUSE FUNDING GOAL: $3,000,000.00 to house 12 - 18 vulnerable seniorsMake Elderhouse a reality.

Representatives from the Canadian Jewish Federation of Welfare Funds, the Calgary Jewish Administrative Office, Calgary Bnai Brith, National Council of Jewish Women, and the Jewish Relief Society met to discuss the establishment of the social service agencyJFSC began in September 1960 as the Jewish Family Service Bureau. The Bureau was incorporated under The Alberta Societies Act in the spring of 1961. Operations started with the services of a volunteer social worker. Funding to assist clients was obtained from various businesses in the City.An interim Board of Directors was set up and officers elected. The Calgary chapter of the National Council for Jewish Women anticipated the need for a paid social worker and dedicated revenue from its first two Angels Balls to the hiring of the first paid social worker. The Jewish Family Service Bureau became a member agency of the United Jewish Appeal. In April of 1963, office space was made available in the Jewish Community Building and the Bureau formally opened for business. Since then, JFSC has grown and evolved; it now offers a broad range of services to families and individuals in need in Calgary.","We offer Counselling, Education, Domestic Violence and Community Support services.COUNSELLING | Jewish Family Service Calgary has a team of professional, qualified counsellors who provide a variety of services including individual, couples, child, and family therapy as well as group work. Our fees are calculated on a sliding scale according to family income. JFSC maintains collaborative relationships with other agencies so inter-agency referrals can take place.EDUCATION SERVICES | The goal of our education programs is to assist individuals and families in coping with the challenges and stresses associated with typical life events such as parenting, separation/divorce, health and wellness and life transitions.COMMUNITY SUPPORT SERVICES (CSS)| Within the Community Support Services (CSS) department, clients can access a combination of services required to meet their unique personal needs. Our experience has well demonstrated that most clients require and benefit from receiving more than one service at a time. Our range of CSS services encompasses the delivery of Basic Needs Assistance/Jewish Advocacy, Vocational, Resettlement/Integration, and Older Adults Services.DOMESTICE VIOLENCE | The Jewish community is not immune from domestic violence. Most statistics say it happens at the same rate and intensity as the mainstream community, 1 out of every 3 women. The only difference for Jewish women is they stay in abusive relationships longer... on average 15 years. This is why, in 2006,JFSC has decided to start a program called Shalom Bayit, dedicated to addressing the issues of domestic violence in the Jewish community.To read more about our Programs and Services, please visit our website.","YOU HAVE THE POWER TO HELP!Volunteer|JFSChas an on-going need for volunteers of all ages, stages and talents.

"168",458,"Junior Achievement of Southern Alberta","I think a lot of kids are born with an entrepreneurial mindset.We are always asking why and trying to find crafty solutions to our problems. Having an inquisitive and entrepreneurial spirit allowed me to see things in a different light growing up.As much as I love formal education, its just not something that comes naturally to me. I was always the student that had to retake tests or courses. I wasnt lazy, but I still had low grades. If Junior Achievement (JA) wasnt around when I was 15 years old, Id probably still be struggling through some traditional classes.I found that I was learning more in JAs Company Program than I was in the classroom. Meeting 15 peers every week to work together to start, operate, and eventually liquidate a business excited me. I knew I always wanted to make a difference through commerce, but it never really occurred to me that I can start making an impact now. The more JA exposed me to, the more I realized that I can be taken seriously.After completing JAs Company Program, I challenged companies to temporarily hire me for an opportunity to learn and work with new mentors. I was willing to work for a bus pass.I completed a hand full of internships and worked tirelessly, always leading with my enthusiasm and resourcefulness. The hard work paid off and in 2014 I was named one of Canadas top 10 entrepreneurs under 24.With the internship experience under my belt, it was time for me to get tangible skills. I wanted to join other entrepreneurs in action. I enrolled in, and graduated from, New Yorks Flatiron Schools intensive coding program for web development, on a scholarship I earned in Company Program. Now I have skills that are landing me job offers on incredible teams across the continent.Junior Achievement has shown me that I really can shape the world we live in.-Cassidy Roberts, Company Program Alumnus","Inspire and educate young Albertans to succeed in the global economy is what we do.

"169",528,"Kerby Centre","Until recently, mom and dad still lived independently (at 84 and 95 respectively). As the primary caregiver (with my husband) and their only family in Calgary, we have had absolutely wonderful moments together, but it also became increasingly difficult to manage their care. And there you were. Wonderful volunteers and staff helping us with groceries every two weeks. This is such a wonderful program. It allowed my parents to remain independent longer, to enjoy their home, be well fed and it certainly helped me get a little bit of a break and maintain some sanity.   - Kate M.for grocery delivery---Located in the heart of Calgary, Alberta, the Kerby Centre is a not-for-profit organization, committed to enhancing the lives of older adults.

"170",814,"Kids Cancer Care Foundation of Alberta","After surgery, Sofia suffered from cerebellar mutism, which means she could not move, talk, walk, or even see to interact with us. She must have been so terrified in those initial days, to wake up in that state, with tubes all over, not being able to do anything but cry. Naushad Hirani, Sofias father Days before her surgery, Sofia was jumping on the trampoline and performing summersaults in gymnastics class. While that carefree little girl is gone forever, your support and her fierce determination are helping her to rebuild a life after cancer. Sofia was four when she was diagnosed with a group three metastatic medulloblastoma, a highly aggressive pediatric brain cancer.Following an emergency surgery to remove the primary tumour, Sofias parents Shelly Bhayana and Naushad Hirani faced life-altering decisions about their daughters course of treatment to come, while also helping her to rehabilitate and relearn to move again.They researched the side effects of craniospinal radiation in excruciating detail and finally agreed to a regimen of high-dose chemotherapy in the hopes that it would eliminate the cancer and minimize the need for radiation.Unfortunately, Sofia couldnt catch a break, says Naushad. Even after the atom bomb of chemotherapy she endured, her cerebrospinal fluid still showed cancer cells.High-dose radiation was her only hope for survival.But the very treatments that saved her life forever changed her life. Sofia suffers from treatment-related brain injury, which has caused mobility, speech, hearing and neurocognitive deficits.But with months of intense physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy, up to three hours a day, Sofia has regained the ability to feed herself and walk with a walker. She wears hearing aids to hear and has learned to talk and write again. She is also learning to dress herself again.Sofia works so hard to do the basic things that we take for granted, says Shelly.Despite her struggles, Sofia rarely complains. Little things bother her like why she cant run or pull on her socks by herself the way her brother and sister can.Unfortunately, Sofia couldnt catch a break. Even after the atom bomb of chemotherapy she endured, her cerebrospinal fluid still showed cancer cells. Naushad, Sofias DadRESEARCH As with most children with cancer, survival has come at an enormous cost for Sofia. Roughly 75 per cent of survivors live with at least one chronic health problem and a third of these conditions are severe or life threatening.With an estimated 30,000 survivors living in Canada today, the late effects of conventional childrens cancer treatments are exacting an enormous cost on the survivor, the family and the health care system.Naushad and Shelly know firsthand the magnitude of these costs.Sofia will never be fully independent, says Shelly. And I worry. What if something happens to us? Who will look after her? How will this impact Shaan and Sonya? What about their childhood?At age four, little sister Sonya already sees the enormity of their familys struggle. DiDis older than me, but Im kind of like the big sister, arent I? she says. What did the doctors do to her mommy?Your financial support is helping researchers in the Experimental and Applied Therapeutics (ExpAT) research effort at the Alberta Childrens Hospital and University of Calgary to improve outcomes for children like Sofia.ExpAT researchers are collaborating with researchers across the hall and around the globe to develop and test new drugs that will save childrens lives without causing such devastating long-term health problems.CAMP  OUTREACH The memories we made until this point were really blissful. When I look back at them now, they almost seem like a fairy-tale. Naushad Hirani.Life for Sofia and her family looks very different today and, while the Hirani family adjusts to a new normal, your support helps families like theirs get outdoors and have fun as a family.There have been many people and organizations to play a helpful part in getting our family and Sofia to this point, but Kids Cancer Care certainly is unique, says Naushad. Kids Cancer Care was there from the beginning with Pizza Nights on the oncology ward and they have been there ever since. They understand that dealing with a disease like this is a long-term issue for the family and that support is really very important for many months, and even years, after a major event like this changes a family.Thanks to you, Sofia and Sonya are regulars at our weekly PEER* program. PEER is an evidence-based exercise and physiotherapy program developed by a multidisciplinary team of researchers at the University of Calgary and the Alberta Childrens Hospital.During weekly PEER sessions, Sofia works with a one-to-one aide to rebuild her muscle and bone mass, cardiovascular capacity and immune system recovery, which supports her daily physiotherapy and occupational therapy routine. Thanks to you, Sofia and Sonya also enjoy our SunRise day camp.Each summer, Sofia is a little more independent and a little more able to participate in a greater range of camp activities.Kids Cancer Care is one of the few organizations that actually looks after families, says Shelly. This is the only camp Sofia can go to that provides a one-to-one aide for her. For kids with needs like Sofias that is essential.The whole family takes part in our weekend Family Camp at Camp Kindle and they enjoy our year-round Outreach programs, including the annual Family Ski Day and Polar Express train ride, courtesy of Aspen Crossing.The Hirani children were overjoyed to meet Santa last year on the Polar Express. And Sofia was thrilled to go adaptive skiing during our Family Ski Day, while Shaan and Sonya skied all day. She was out there for two hours and she didnt want to come in, says Shelly.Thanks to you, the Hirani children are able to get outdoors and be active together as siblings.This is so important, because Shaan was older when Sofia was diagnosed and he really misses his sister, says Shelly.Camp and Outreach programs also offer Mom and Dad a much-needed break, while providing an opportunity for them to connect with other parents in a supportive community that understands.These kinds of events give our family a sense of belonging, says Naushad. And I think it helps our kids feel that there are people out there who do understand.EDUCATION SUPPORT  SCHOLARSHIPS With your continued support, Sofia is able to see a tutor each week through our Education Support Program. During one-to-one tutoring sessions at home, Sofia and her tutor work on her reading and math skills, filling a critical gap not met through school or therapy services.Sofia will always have to work exceedingly hard for the smallest of gains, but with your support and her quiet and fierce tenacity, she will continue to make progress. Thanks to you, she will receive the support she needs during her primary and secondary school years, so that one day she may pursue post-secondary studies. And, when shes ready, Kids Cancer Care will be there with a scholarship to help her on her way.","When your family has to deal with a child with cancer, it brings along many painful experiences, tears, fear and heartbreak. It is an absolute joy to watch my children forget about treatment and just be children again. Thank you Kids Cancer Care for making it possible for our children to smile again! - ParentOur programs are uniquely designed to meet the needs of the whole family at each stage of the cancer journey, from diagnosis through treatment and beyond. In 1986, when Christine McIvers son Derek was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumour, there were very few programs in the province to help children and families navigate the frightening diagnosis of childhood cancer.It all began with a mom, volunteering in her basement, to make a better future for children diagnosed with cancer.Today, Kids Cancer Care is one of the largest childhood cancer research funders in the country. The foundation now offers more than 20 year-round and summer camp and outreach programs, along with education support program and services to Alberta families. Kids Cancer Care is one of only a handful of charities in North America dedicated to supporting the entire continuum of childhood cancer, fighting the disease on all fronts, with laughter at camp, the best treatments at the hospital and innovative science in the lab and brighter futures through education support and post-secondary scholarships.","The Kids Cancer Care Foundation of Alberta is passionately dedicated to helping young people and their families affected by childhood cancer survive and thrive in body, mind and spirit. Our programs are uniquely designed to meet the needs of the whole family at each stage in the cancer journey, from diagnosis through treatment and beyond. The Foundation is committed to changing the course of childrens cancer by providing programs and funding in four key areas:CAMP- You can help kids be kids again. Cancer is a frightening and lonely experience for kids. It shatters their confidence and steals their innocence. Our camps offer children a chance to escape the rigours of cancer treatment for days of fun-filled adventure with kids their own age. At Camp Kindle, they find friendship and new reserves of confidence and strength  along with a healthy dose of mischief laughter and fun.OUTREACH- You can help families escape the demands of cancer.Our family outreach programs are offered all year long. Whether its a hockey game, yoga class or laser tag, our programs for tots, teens, parents and the whole family provide a fun, safe place to spend some time with other families affected by childhood cancer.RESEARCH- You can help give kids a fighting chance. Kids Cancer Care is committed to being a catalyst for groundbreaking research. Our investment in the experimental and applied therapeutics program at the Alberta Childrens Hospital and the University of Calgary is making research into the most difficult childhood cancers possible, giving children access to new treatments where conventional treatments have failed. For some kids, this means a second chance at life.HOSPITAL PROGRAMS-You can help kids heal.Our goal is to see every child with cancer in Alberta receive the best care without leaving the province, so they can be close to their family and friends when they need them most. By funding a range of hospital programs from specialized medical equipment to bereavement programs and educational seminar, were making sure Alberta children with cancer and their families heal at all levels  body, mind and spirit.SCHOLARSHIPS-You can help kids pursue their dreams! Lengthy stays at the hospital lead to missed school and missed opportunities. Cancer treatments such as radiation, chemotherapy or surgery may lead to crippling long-term disabilities that seriously impair the childs quality of life. The Derek Wandzura Memorial Scholarship Fund was designed with these realities in mind. Awarded annually to childhood cancer survivors in southern Alberta, the bursary gives these young people that all-important boost they need as they begin to follow their dreams. Kids Cancer Care also offers support for young people disadvantaged by cancer during their primary and secondary school years.EDUCATIONAL SUPPORT-You can help kids get back on track!Survivors of childhood cancer often face long-term side-effects, which are complex and can impact their ability to learn and perform academically. Kids Cancer Care actively supports children disadvantaged by cancer, throughout their primary and secondary school years with tutoring and a range of other educational support services.","Family Camp - Camp KindleYour $10,000 donation will bring families together at Family CampEach spring and fall, Kids Cancer Care offers a weekend Family Camp, where families come together and enjoy family time with each other, miles from the hospital and the daily demands of caring for a child affected by cancer. Help provide these families with a healing and supportive community, where they can relax, re-energize and renew their spirits for the long journey ahead. Education Support  Tutoring ServicesYour$2,500 donationwill help recruit, screen, match and retain specialized tutors.Childhood cancer is rarely over when the treatments stop. Seventy five per cent of survivors face complex, long-term side-effects that can impact their ability to learn and perform academically, leading to lower levels of education and poorer employment outcomes for some. By investing in our Education Support Program, you can help turn things around for these kids by helping us to recruit and screen, match and retain specialized tutors. These tutors will design customized learning plans and meet one-to-one in the childs home for weekly tutoring sessions, helping the child to develop the tools and skills they need to succeed at school.People need to understand that kids affected by cancer are going to be behind in school. I dont know of any child, whos had cancer, who wouldnt benefit from the Education Support Program. These kids need one-to-one help. They need repetition. They need very specialized, consistent, long-term support sustained over time. And they need patience. Thats what these kids need. I am seeing the progress in Erik  not leaps and bounds  but he is consistently progressing over time. It would devastate us if we didnt have this tutoring support.cancer momScholarships You can help a survivor fulfill their dreams with a $2,500 donation toward our scholarship fundSeventy five per cent of childhood cancer survivors experience at least one chronic health complication related to their cancer treatments, which may affect their ability to learn and perform. These young people often miss more school and may fall behind their peers, putting them at a disadvantage when it comes to post-secondary education. Managing the permanent after effects of cancer and its treatments also puts financial strain on the family, making higher education a difficult option for some families. The Kids Cancer Care Derek Wandzura Memorial Scholarship Fund, an endowed fund at the Calgary Foundation, was designed to level the playing field for survivors of childhood cancer by offering them a scholarship to a post-secondary institute of their choice. With a $2,500 investment, you can help a young person follow their dreams through advanced education.Send a Kid to Camp Your$1,500 donationwill send a kid to Camp Kindle for one week!Camp gives children a chance to escape the rigours of cancer treatment for fun-filled adventure with others their own age.

"171",717,"Kids Help Phone - Alberta Region Office","Young people in Canada have been turning to Kids Help Phone for help during their most difficult challenges for more than 27 years. Our Five-Year goal is for Kids Help Phone to be the most nimble, accessible, effective access point for young people to the support they need.All too often, our counsellors hear from kids suffering from verbal or emotional abuse. These young people can feel worthless, depressed, and anxious. Some even start to believe they deserve the negativity. Its so important for these kids to have someone they can open up to.Here is the story of a past service user who came forward with his story as an ambassador of our services.Aidens Story:Kids Help Phone helps kids in Canada over 1 million times per year, 6 years ago I was 1 in a million. Today I reflect back to say thank you, to let you know I survived, and to speak out so others can also survive. When I was nine years old my parents became divorced. Shortly after I became an outlet for my mothers feelings. At first it started with unrealistic expectations, and when I couldnt fulfil her expectations she would hit me. Shortly after that a new activity started... what she called special time locked in her room she sexually abused me, she made me powerless with threats that she would harm my brother, or even take my life. Special time became routine for nine more years... I grew numb, my grades dropped in school, I became a target of bullies, I felt like an empty shell labelled child.In grade 12 I wasnt sure why I was still alive. Routines at home had become so ordinary I had no idea something was wrong. I felt my life was normal, and one day I casually mentioned some of the things that happened at home when one of my friends was explaining how she got in trouble. I remember the blank looks on their face after I spoke... I didnt believe it at the time but my life at home was not okay, and it should never be normal. That day was the longest day in my life so far... what started as a casual mention to a friend, became a conversation with a teacher, which then went to a school counsellor who made a call to child services. I felt I betrayed my mom, and I still remember my friend sitting with me during lunch as I cried, scared, lost, and confused. I ended up living with my brother, safe from the routine... but not from the memories. I didnt know how to process the feelings and at that point it felt hopeless. Thats when I found Kids Help Phone; I saw your number on the cereal box. I didnt know if you could help someone like me but I had to try. I was very scared on my first call but even though they werent with me they quickly made me feel safe. I told you about my mother, I talked about how angry I was at myself and how I dealt with those feelings. You didnt laugh or judge me, instead you gave me hope, you gave me courage, and you told me I was brave. You connected me with local counsellors I could talk to and you were always there on the nights I was overwhelmed. You gave me homework to keep me going, little tasks like listing what I like about myself or what I dream to be. When I felt alone you shared with me the idea of a chosen family, picking people I trust and can build a strong relationship with. Today I have a chosen Family that consists of my biological brother along with four sisters, a mother and a father. On New Years Eve you gave me strength to fight through another year, at midnight the first person I said Happy New Years to was a counsellor named Sandra. I came to you broken and alone, you helped me find the strength to keep moving forward. You were role models on how I deserved to be treated as a person. I want you to know Im much stronger now. In an analogy you once used, Im in the drivers seat now and the past memories no longer fill my rear view mirror. So many amazing things have happened that they are only minor bumps in the distance. I have a growing career; Ive gone back to my high school and spoken on hope. Ive had the opportunity to tell kids about Kids Help Phone and I will always be a volunteer in order to encourage kids to always raise their voice. I am truly thankful for Kids Help Phone being there... for me, 1 in a million... Thank You!","A Leader and Trusted ResourceGrowing up isnt easy  it was true when Kids Help Phone opened our phone lines for the first time in 1989, and it continues to be true today.Kids Help Phone is theonlynational helpline for children and young people in Canada.

This contact keeps us keenly aware of the emerging needs of young people and the year-over-year growth in demand for our services.In fact, since 2010, telephone counselling has increased by 127%. This indicates that while Kids Help Phone now offers our trusted support online, many young people still want to hear a voice at the other end of the line. Our professional counsellors are there for that, ready to talk to kids, no matter how big or how small their problem may seem.So just how important are our services? Consider that since 2013, there has been:29% increase in counselling sessions from young people struggling with mental and emotional health concerns;22% increase in counselling sessions from young people experiencing suicidal thoughts;29% increase in demand for Live Chat counselling;16% increase in callers aged 17-20+ who, in general, deal with a far more complex range of issues.These are just a few of the indications that young peoples concerns are getting more complex. As a result of this, it can take us longer to respond to their needs. This means that, just as kids are struggling with their emotions and life challenges, we find ourselves struggling sometimes too  just to keep up with their demand for our service. Thats because more youth need us now than ever before.By supporting Kids Help Phone, youre committing to youth in your community.

We give kids and families a much needed break, time together and time for renewal, to allow kids to just be kids! We fuel imaginations, inspire dreams, spark creativity, and help create memories that will last a lifetime.Highlights of 2015:distributed over $1.2 million worth of ticket opportunitieshosted 170 Kids Count special eventsfilled over 200 suites at the Saddledomepartnered with 209 local charities and agenciesfacilitated almost 29,000 amazing experiences for deserving kidswelcomed T the Ticket as our mascotdebut of our Saddledome float in the Calgary Stampede Parade!grew our volunteer program to over 100 registered and trained support people!","The Cant Use Your Ticket program is our largest and founding program. We provide free access to sporting, arts, recreation, arts, cultural and educational events for deserving children in Calgary and surrounding communities. Our goal is to give children experiences and memories that will last a lifetime, and opportunities that they may not normally receive. While other agencies provide food and shelter, we provide nourishment of the spirit, respite and relief in times of adversity. Kids can attend a hockey game for the very first time, go to the zoo with their parents while receiving services at the Childrens Hospital, or attend the theatre with peers from their school progam.Through ourKids Count Program, kids can meet the actors of a playhouse and get a backstage tour, go to a cooking class, or try curling with their mentors! They can get autographs with celebrities and athletes, venue tours, or go on field trips.Our most exciting program, Getzlafs Gamers, is a wonderful partnership between Ryan Getzlaf, a former Calgary Hitmen and captain of the Anaheim Ducks, the Calgary Hitmen, and Telus to bring groups of deserving kids to a suite for a Hitmen game, pizza, beverages, autographs, swag, an appearance on the Jumbotron, and a chance to meet Farley the Fox and the Calgary Hitmen players!

"173",800,"KidSport Calgary (KidSport Canada - Alberta)","Sports are the ultimate life coach for kids. Through sport, they learn the values of teamwork, leadership, commitment and perseverance. However, for some kids, the costs associated with organized sports are too great, and severely affect their ability to participate.I was one of these kids, but I was also one of the kids lucky enough to receive support from KidSport Calgary. This is my storyMy family arrived in Canada in 1994, as immigrants fleeing the Yugoslav Wars. My parents arrived here without any close family and knowing little English. They came from a place where they were successful professionals, and arrived in a place where their post-secondary education was not recognized.My parents were strong believers in the importance of sport in the development of young people, and first enrolled me in organized sports at the age of seven. They registered me in water polo, a sport that was extremely popular in the former Yugoslavia. My love of the game would come very soon after my first practice, and my experiences with water polo would influence the rest of my life.My parents were determined to make the most of their lives in Canada, and were in the process of earning University degrees for the second time as well as working jobs to support their family. In my early years in water polo, many of the costs associated with organized sport became too much for my family. In order to afford these costs my family turned to the services of KidSport Calgary. The assistance offered by KidSport would allow me the chance to work towards and experience high-level competition, and would become crucial in my development into a high performance athlete.As the years passed, my parents would become successful professionals and my family would no longer need the services of KidSport. However, their support allowed me to take some of my first steps in my athletic career.I have been able to compete at the highest levels of international Water Polo. As a retired member of the Senior Mens Canadian Water Polo Team, I have competed at three World Championships and two Pan American Games. Water polo has taken me across the world and allowed me to compete on six continents. I have also been fortunate enough to play water polo professionally in Europe for two seasons.My success in sport, as in any success in life, can be attributed to numerous people and organizations that helped me along the way. KidSport is definitely one of the organizations that was crucial in my development as a young athlete. I am a strong believer in KidSport, and just one of the countless individuals that has had their life changed by the assistance they provide.-Oliver Vikalo, Retired from the Canadian Mens Water Polo TeamCurrently, works for TEKsystems as an IT Applications RecruiterKidSport Calgary and Area exist because of testimonials like this. KidSport believes in providing all kids with the opportunity to experience the positive benefits that sport showcases, through taking away the financial barriers for vulnerable families.Sadly, 1 in 3 kids in our city cannot afford to participate in organized sport. In 1995, KidSport Calgary opened our doors to ensure that all kids who dream to play, can do just that.We work hard to make it So ALL Kids Can Play!","Over 38,000 kids have been given the gift of sport and helped them get off the sideline and into the game, since opening our doors in 1995. Distributing over $9.3 million that was raised from the community, back into our communities sport clubs and organizations.Through our sport registration fee assistance program, that is based on a qualifying application process, each qualified kid who is under 18 years old and registered in a sport program, can receive up to $325 per calendar year for his or her sport registration fees. With a goal to continue to raise more funds so we can support more kids, at a higher level of financial assistance, keeping up with the rising cost of sport.OUR IMPACT:17,267 kids assisted  over $4.5 million distributed since 20124,386 kids assisted to participate in organized sport; and$1,123,549 distributed within Calgary and area in 20164,600 kids will be assisted  $1.3 million distributed (2017 estimate)What the research is saying:91% of Canadians believe participation in sports teaches children important life skillsA vast majority of Canadians agree that having kids involved in organized sport is an essential part of their physical (87%), social (84%), and emotional (80%) developmentYouth who participate in sport are less likely to engage in delinquent behavior and have lower rates of criminal arrestSport offers young people a means to gain and enhance a range of life skills that can improve their chances of finding employment, raise their level of income, and make them more optimistic and willing to volunteer in their communitySport and physical education help improve young peoples school attendance, behavior, and academic achievementSport facilitates friendships and positive social relations, which also play an important role in youth identity formationSport keeps children and youth active and healthySport can contribute to giving children a healthy start in life, help those with apoor start get back on track, and equip youth with the information, skills, personal resources and social support they need to make key life transitions successfully*Data andstatistics abovehas been referenced from the following reports on sport:CIBC- KidSport ReportandWhat Sport Can Do: The True Sport Report","We provide financial assistance through our sport registration fee assistance program to qualified kids as our core program. Outside of this we look to find ways to connect with the community in getting kids active and ensuring the low-income demographic is nurtured and supported when finding new opportunities to experience sport.Our core program is an application-based program. Families applying to us fill out their portion, work with the community sports organization to fill out their part and then submit the application with the necessary income verification documents. Once we receive an application, the process to receive the funds takes 3-4 weeks. Once approved, the cheque goes to the sport club to assist with the approved applicants registration fees.We have secondary programs that promote activity and sport as well:Skate Shacks- KidSport Calgary operates two large trailers stocked with skates and helmets that we loan at no cost to community organizations and schools. Over 8500 kids and their families use these skate shacks each winter. This is a program focused on getting kids active by providing them equipment they may need to try an activity like skating and is not made possible without the support from ULS Landscaping and Maintenance to drop off and pick up the skate shacks each season.Equipment support- in 2014 we partnered up with Southern Albertas very first Sports Equipment Bank.Located right here in Calgary, Comries Sports Equipment Bank is aligned directly with us in helping get more kids involved in sport that may currently face financial barriers that are keeping them from this valuable opportunity. Together with our partners at Comries we are breaking down the two main barriers facing families when it comes to sport participation - cost of sport registration and cost of equipment. As soon as a kid is approved for his or her sport registration fee assistance, they are also pre-approved for Comries Sports Equipment Bank, if equipment is needed.","Our sport registration fee assistance program not possible without financial support from the community. We rely 100% on community raised dollars through individual donors, corporate donors, grants, foundations, KidSport Calgary fundraisers/campaigns and third party events. Being a local non-profit organization, funds raised in Calgary and Area, stay in Calgary and Area.Our greatest need is to continue to grow our donor pool and seek out new fundraising dollars so we can continue to meet the demand we have here in Calgary and Area.

"174",389,"Legacy Place Society (Diakonos Peace Officer Retreat)","Flashing lights, burning buildings, Police Line Do Not Cross tape, make shift medical scenes, devastation and destruction. Our job is to respond when people are in the midst of an extreme crisis. While some call us heroes, were really common folks called to a profession that deals with the brokenness of this world.I know first hand the every day struggles faced by First Responders. I am one.Weve seen people die before our eyes, helpless to do anything. Weve responded to violent robberies, domestic disputes, homicides and suicides. We run into the dangerous situations that everyone else runs away from. Weve rang many door bells and comforted the families while telling them that their loved one has passed away.The sights, smells, sounds and carnage of our job can haunt us. We are trained to have answers and control situations. Its hard to drop it all from your mind when you walk through the front door to your family at the end of the shift. There is a stigma around admiting help is needed to mental health concerns. Heroes arent supposed to have emotional breakdowns, not in front of their families and especially not at work.I tried my best to live a normal life outside of work, but Ive suffered anxiety over simple normal things that remind me of horrendous situations that Ive been called to. Sometimes Ive slept poorly and the pent up frustrations become overwhelming on my family.My spouse was living a roller-coaster existence, never knowing when I would be called out, uncertain if or when Id be home. At home I was often disengaged, distant and really trying desperately to recover from the trauma of the job. My kids avoided me because of my anger. One day it became too much for my family and I found my bags at the door and told to get help. I realized I needed help but how do I do it without being judged or navigate thru the difficult depths of the situation I was facing.I had heard of Legacy Place Society in its support to First Responder and Military Families but I still didnt feel that it was something that applied to me. But stubborn me, Ill figure it out on my own. I dont need to talk about this emotional or relationship stuff to anyone. Guess how long that lasted.Legacy Place Society provides confidential accommodation support for us. A quiet place, away from triggers that allows us to figure things out. Others also seeking this support understand where were at as they too had to make this courageous step. We dont have to put on a happy face for our kids or hide away our feelings. We can freely speak about whats going on without fear of being judged or losing our jobs. This is a place where rest and healing can begin. A place of support and encouragement. Yes the first days were tough, fighting the urge to walk away, fight off the fear I wasnt going to make it through this. But after wiped tears and conversations, and time with professional councelling, I realized I can and I will become victorious over this blip on the radar. Through tough decisions and behavioral changes, Ive grown stronger in so many ways, including going back to my family and sharing this new resiliency from within and sharing it with my co-workers. I realized for myself and also others around me, its not a matter of if this same experience will happen but when. I am grateful for the support and patience from my family and Legacy Place Society.","Our Peace Officers, Fire Fighters, Emergency Medical Services, 911 Dispatch and Military Personnel face frustrating and devastating situations on the workfront and then find themselves working hard to find a balanced life perspective on the homefront.Our Mission: Provide empathetic support that builds resiliency individually and within our First Responder and Military Families. Our Vision: That all First Responder and Military Personnel have user friendly access to resources to build resiliency as an individual and/or as a family.Our Values: Family, Empathy, Diversity and Inclusivity, Confidentiality, Collaboration, IntegrityOur History: Founded in 1997 by a group of Calgary and Edmonton Police Officers who felt there was a gap between the professional life and the transition to the home front. There was a period within a year of several suicides within Policing in Alberta and discovery of situations where First Responders were having difficulties in coming home because of the stresses they were carrying from work. The sights, sounds and carnage have a way of building up within the human mind that is difficult to shake off. Sleeping in their vehicles and couch surfing at a buddies basement became a disturbing trend. Over the years, the Services that represent Police, Fire, EMS, 911 Dispatch and Military have developed different types of Peer Support resources and instruction to better assist ways of coping to the challenges of the profession. Legacy Place Society is the CONFIDENTIAL home away from home that supports First Responders and Military Personnel individually or as a family in providing accommodations during times of family crisis within marriages or for medical attention (Counselling, cancer, occupational stress injury, post-traumatic stress, surgery, etc).Since opening the doors in 2001, we have received over 24,000 nightly stays between the 3 locations (Calgary 2001, Edmonton 2004 and Red Deer in 2010). Military Personnel were added in 2010 simply due to lack of available resources and because of the cross over of professions once the military career has retired. Our audience consists of currently serving First Responder and Military Personnel and those who are retired veterans of these professions.Our First Responders are human too. At the end of their shift and its time to go home, its quite difficult to disengage from the days events. Communication, adjusting to family routine and coping behaviors can be challenging within themselves of within the family. Our programs detail many areas including participation with peer support, education bursaries, scholarships, leaving legacies, benevolence, resiliency workshops, humanitarian mission trips, and family camp to name a few.","Home Away From Home Resources - If there should be a request to participate in the home away from home resources, please note there is a location in Calgary, Edmonton and Red Deer that is a residential home setting close to hospitals and Operational Stress Injury Clinics. For unique circumstances in rural Alberta, assistance is assessed on a case by case situation.Peer Support Conversation And Networking - this consists of dedicated volunteers who desire to provide confidential and collaborative support in the areas of conversation about marriage, parenting, grief, spiritual wellness, addiction recovery, single parenting, anger management and journey thru PTSD recovery to name a few. No one should feel shunned, lonely or shame as they seek conversation about anything. The truth is, we never know what someone is going through until the conversation starts.Family Camps - taking time with family and do some fun stuff together - not at a mall but in a camp setting with nature and a multitude of activities such as canoeing, high ropes, wall climb, paint ball, horse back rides, camp fires, etc. Included are team building or youth resiliency workshops. The parents can also participate in informative wellness, marriage, or mindfulness assessments or instruction. The goal is creating memories and conversations that generate stronger family bonds.Family Resiliency Workshops - occasionally partnered with other like organizations, these workshops provide a variety of topics that could include mental health readiness, psychological first aid, spiritual wellness, parenting, special needs and marriage support to name a few.Humanitarian Mission Trips - these self funded trips provide First Responders and Military Families opportunities to participate in outreach programs in other countries. Primarily, this includes house building in the Tecate area of Mexico or case by case situation with natural disasters. Participation with the house building (usually late March) includes involving your whole family in this incredibly rewarding build of a home for a family in need. Education Bursaries - qualified individuals can submit an application to an education bursary that is relevant to continuing education in the field of work that supports the career/home front that is not already covered by the Services. Benevolence Support - each of the Services have independent resources that support benevolence situations and inquiries should first go through the specific Service you work for. If there is a scenerio for example where there is a serious family health situation that co-workers would like to raise funds for, please contact us about the application process.Leaving A Legacy - as individuals we all leave each day interactions with family, co-workers, friends and our community a living legacy that includes conversation, wisdom, memories, actions and at times financial contribution. As noted with the sights, smells, sounds and carnage associated with our First Responder and Military Community, its critical that we as citizens help those who help us in times of crisis including creating stronger communities together. Ultimately, for the First Responders and Military, the challenges at times can be extremely difficult to transition through and doing normal family life can be tough. Suicides, family breakdowns, Post Traumatic Stress and Opertational Stress Injuries happen within the Services. We talk about the legacy of impact that is taking shape through good and bad behaviors and encourage drawing strength from the great accomplishments and extraordinary contributions that have been made while adjusting other areas of concern. Capturing and sharing with focus on transmitting personal and family values, core principles and life lessons with each other and with the family is important. Leaving a legacy can also be through financial means as a one time or monthly gift in memory of or supporting Legacy Place Society programs. Please feel free to talk to us as we continue to share resources in building resiliency and family legacies within our First Responder and Military Families.","Be a strong contributing citizen in the community in ways that provide mentoring or volunteer support. Mentoring and volunteering contribute to the well being of others and develops tremendous personal development. Crime is statistically less in communities where mentoring and volunteering is present.Participate in a fund raising event or develop one yourself to raise funds for the Legacy Place Society - if donating through the United Way, consider the designation to Legacy Place Society.Participate in First Responder and Military public community events and Remembrance or Memorial Days.If you know of anyone who is currently serving or is retired from the professions of Peace Officer, Fire Fighter, Emergency Medical Services, 911 Dispatch or Military, and feel they should be made aware of Legacy Place Society, encourage them to find us on Twitter, Facebook or contact us to get on our newsletter communications.Share your story with us of how a First Responder or Military person impacted your life - this could be as a family member, speaking at your school, being part of a 911 type of situation as examples.Mailed letters of encouragement for our First Responders and Military will be forwarded to the Services. Consider becoming a financial monthly ($15) or once a year supporter ($100) and receive a charitable tax receipt - your donation will support areas of accommodations, benevolence, education, workshops or the Legacy Tributes.

"175",369,"LINKages Society of Alberta","On June 1st, 2013, there was a big party in Downtown East Village (EV). Hundreds of people of all ages gathered for IG Day (Intergenerational Day) for dancing, singing, a barbeque and planting a community flower garden at Murdoch Manor, all organized by LINKages youth volunteers. Less than 20 days later, in the midst of mandatory evacuation orders, EV seniors scrambled to save their new garden from incoming flood waters.East Village residents, most of them seniors, made up the largest single group of Calgary flood evacuees and would not return to their homes and belongings for almost two months. Through the ordeal, their young LINKages friends did their best to stay in touch and when it was time to come home, LINKages volunteers were there to help them settle in. Over 200 post-secondary students signed up to help with resettlement and made the core of what soon became University of Calgarys LINKages Club.The evacuation and resettlement catalyzed the relationship between LINKages Society and EV. Seniors were amazed and gratified that young people would help them out and be their friends just because. The youth volunteers were moved to help and inspired by the courage, sense of humour and perseverance of the seniors.Almost two years later, LINKages has grown to a real EV partner, collaborating with seniors, the East Village Neighbourhood Association (EVNA), The Golden Age Club and other community partners to offer community events like annual Remembrance Day ceremonies and monthly games nights. A Wii Bowling tournament at the Golden Age Club drew dozens of seniors who came to try something new  including a 94-year-old who stepped up to Wii bowl with her walker!As EV seniors come out to LINKages events, they get to know their neighbours better, see whats happening in their neighbourhood and feel more connected to other services and groups as well. Friendships with U of C LINKages Club volunteers break through loneliness, isolation and sometimes mistrust some of the seniors may feel. And its a two-way street  our youth volunteers enjoy their senior friends, learn from them and are inspired by them to be really engaged in their community.Without regular opportunities to connect, youth and seniors can develop misunderstandings about one another that lead to ageism and disregard for the gifts each generation has. Seniors lose their place as mentors, models and companions to young people and young people lose the opportunity to learn from and care for their elders.Many U of C LINKages Club volunteers are alumni of our high school and junior high programs, which train youth to be compassionate, responsible volunteers and dispel fears and misconceptions teens and elderly people may have about one another. Their friendships lead to a new sense of belonging, purpose and engagement for both generations and help make Calgary communities places where people of all ages can contribute their strengths, talents and enthusiasm now and into the future.You can find out more about our community and school-based programs at www.link-ages.ca.","At LINKages, we believe communities lose vital talent, experience, energy, heritage and empathy when we lose connection with the people in our neighbourhoods. We especially lose when we forget how much young people and elders have to offer each other.When was the last time you had a meaningful interaction with someone significantly older or younger than you?Unless you work with elderly people or children, you likely would have to try really hard to find opportunities to regularly connect with someone from a different generation and you might even be apprehensive about doing so. Often, we dont live in the same city or even country we grew up in. Work and other commitments mean we dont spend much time in our own neighbourhoods. Families are spread out, young children and teens spend their time in age-segregated classes and activities and older people tend to become former neighbours when they move to retirement communities or assisted living residences.To counter the trend toward age segregation and even ageism, LINKages makes meaningful opportunities for youth ages 12-24 and seniors to be friends and mentors to each other. Our intergenerational programs and initiatives help create mutually beneficial relationships, responsible and caring volunteer opportunities, and impactful, inclusive community events and activities for youth and seniors.               - Response from Colleen, School Programs ManagerOur Vision: A strong and vibrant community where youth and seniors thriveOur Mission: To facilitate innovative intergenerational programs and services that encourage involvement, transfer of knowledge and capitalize on the strengths of youth and seniors to foster strong Alberta communities","LINKages Society of Alberta offers a broad range of intergenerational programs and services. With 20 years of experience, we are recognized as an expert in designing and delivering research-based initiatives in Calgary and other communities throughout Alberta.We partner with donors to offer these programs to our students and seniors free-of-charge, so no one, young or old, is prevented from participating due to financial barriers.Each year, over 700 youth and student volunteers participate in our school-based intergenerational programs and we touch a similar number of elders and young adults through our community-based programs. Last year, LINKages youth and senior volunteers contributed 16,000 volunteer hours!We build connections and community through:School-based Programs - junior high and high school students visit with seniors living in assisted-living facilities or retirement residences weekly or biweekly through the school year. Students are trained in how to be a responsible volunteer and they receive instant-aging training to help develop empathy and excellent communications and interpersonal skills through their LINKages experience. Schools and seniors residence staff member liaisons work with LINKages to help ensure the success of the programs.LINKages Program Coordinators design and facilitate activities to support beneficial connections where each generation learns from the other. One of the first reactions from both ages is happy surprise at how much the other generation is just like their own.Tech Programs - LINKages offers shorter-term programs where student volunteers mentor seniors in computing and internet literacy. As with all our programs, these are designed to be beneficial and impactful to both generations. While the seniors are learning computer skills, their young teachers are also learning from their senior students.Community Initiatives - LINKages and the LINKages U of C club engage seniors through intergenerational events and activities in their neighbourhoods with an aim to decrease seniors isolation and encourage community participation. LINKages connects with local community groups, agencies and services to determine effective and impactful ways to engage youth and seniors on a regular basis to help strengthen communities and build their social capacity.Intergenerational Day (IG Day) - June 1st is IG Day! LINKages Society organizes events in Calgary that celebrate the joy of sharing experiences with people of all ages. 2015 is our 4th annual IG Day celebration. For the past several years, thousands of Calgarians have enjoyed IG Day activities at the East Village and Genesis Centre.LINK Outreach (Linking Intergenerational Needs and Knowledge) - Communities throughout Alberta understand the benefits of intergenerational programs, but for these programs to be effective and successful over time, careful planning and knowledgeable delivery are of prime importance. LINKages offers workshops, practical advice and support on best practices for implementing intergenerational programs (IGPs) to communities throughout Alberta so that they can set up their own IGPs.","Teens and young adults growing in confidence, empathy and community engagement.

"176",604,"Literacy for Life Foundation","We work hard to tell our story, which is your story, our story, the communitys story. Lets make it a happy ending. What do you do if you dont have the skills to deal with day to day life?Imagine not being able to understand the newspaper, understand your childs report card, or make sense of safety instructions at work.For almost half of Canadian adults, this is a daily problem.According to Statistics Canada, 48% of adults struggle with literacy. The proportion is even worse for those in middle age. And even when new immigrants are excluded, the numbers remain pretty much the same. For some, it is an embarrassing secret they keep to themselves, developing coping strategies to cover their lack of reading skills. For others, it is a barrier that keeps them in low-paying jobs, or even prevents them from getting a job.Why do we Exist?We started as a grassroots movement within the MD of Foothills #31 that became a non profit in 1998 and a registered charity in 1999. A small group of dedicated community members recognized the importance of creating a structure that would facilitate building a literate community within the MD of Foothills #31 where all community members could reach their potential. It has grown exponentially and faced economic down turns and the flood of 2013 which is one of the mostdevastating natural disasters in Canadian history, with creativity and perseverance. Programs and services focus on the community members of the MD however it is now recognized at a provincial level due to work done on curriculum development and trainingWe are a small non profit but have a large capacity because we strongly believe in the power of collaboration. All of our programs are done in partnership creating ownership of the issue and are providedin multiplecommunities or in the hometo ensure accessibility for all.What is literacy?Literacy is more than reading and writing. It is the ability to communicate your needs and wants to the people around you and to understand what others are telling you. It includes listening, speaking, numeracy, getting along with people, problem solving, computer use and understanding and using different types of written material such as documents and prose. These are the essential skills needed in our society for people to live their LIFES.A challenge that affects every CanadianThe literacy level in our communities and our country affects us all.The direct cost of lower literacy skills to Canadian business is estimated to be in the order of four billion dollars per year, and the total cost impact on Canadian society has been conservatively estimated at 10 billion dollars. This is only going to get worse!Our world has changed dramatically in the last 50 years. Researchers believe in the next 100 years we will see 20,000 years of change and growth in technology. The Canadian economy will demand a highly skilled worker in the labour market. Technology and expectations of the present day employee continue to change dramatically and even at home there is an expectation of higher levels of problem solving ability.The reason for criminal offenses?On average criminal offenders have significantly lower literacy skills than the general population. Offenders experience literacy problems at a rate 3 times that of the general population. They are also 4 times as likely to have learning disabilities. 36% of offenders have not completed grade nine and according to the Correctional Service of Canada, the average education level of newly admitted offenders, serving two years or more, is grade seven.Families are the foundation of our communities:The health, safety, and welfare of entire families are compromised by lack of the essential skills. It tends to be intergenerational, resulting in poor academic performance, and higher school dropout rates among school-age children in homes where caregivers cannot read. The inability to read dosage information on over-the-counter and prescription drugs can be life threatening.The principles behind Literacy for Lifes workThe family is the strongest element in shaping lives. Its the most powerful support network there is. Its where the cycle of learning begins, where the attitudes of parents about learning become the educational values of their children. Through education of more than one generation, family literacy programs build on families strengths and provide the tools and support they need to become stronger and more self-sufficient. (National Centre for Family Literacy  Kentucky)The first five years of a childs life are key to their development. Most early childhood development experiences take place within families and all parents can have a positive impact on the development of their children.It is important to effect an individuals literacy development early, but as literacy and learning is a lifetime process, it is never too late and never too early. Our family literacy programs impact on a childs literacy at the early stages as well as teach the caregiver the importance of their own learning to their success, as well as their childrens.We support adults in their learning and help them build essential skills for success in work, family and community.The best learning takes place within positive relationships and environments. Learning should be fun and make sense.It is never too late for an individual to make a difference in their own learning.Partnering in our community for successThrough partnerships and networking Literacy for Life Foundation continually strives to find ways to support community members across the continuum  from birth to seniors.","Literacy for Life is about more than teaching people to read - it is about helping people find a new way to live.Consider the young single mom who had just moved to Okotoks, from one of the reserves, determined to provide a better life for herself and her two little girls.When she told us her story we were amazed by the strength and courage it took to leave the reserve. Completely alone and without support she lacked ideas and knowledge on ways to change her circumstances.We determined the best way Literacy for Life could begin was with our Building Blocks program. A trained Literacy Builder went to her home and together they designed a program that built on her strengths as a parent while recognizing her low literacy and lack of confidence. While working with Mom on reading and parenting skills the Literacy Builder quickly recognized the program length wasnt sufficient to give Mom the support she needed. We extended the program to give her the gift of time to integrate the new skills and strategies into her familys lives while putting other supports in place.Moms determination didnt stop there as she had a dream to get her GED and go back home to become a law enforcement officer.Resolved to support her we connected her with a reading therapist (who normally charges for services) to identify what type of strategies could be used by a volunteer learning coach. The therapist recognized the uphill battle Mom faced. She was so moved by Moms strength and determination she offered to work with the Mom at no cost.There was one more challenge to overcome before we could start. Mom would need time for tutoring and she couldnt afford childcare. Determined to find a solution the Coordinator made a connection with a childcare facility requesting help in accessing the childcare. Not only did they approve a spot but they also provided a subsidy. It was also during this time we identified that Mom was possibly dealing with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder. With her consent we were able to get an assessment that confirmed the diagnosis, providing valuable information on next steps. She needed more than we could provide and was connected to a home support agency that focused on life skills and parenting skills.Today her story continues to unfold...At Literacy for Life we recognize that literacy isnt simply about learning to read, its about creating the opportunity to learn.Some Highlights of our Story!1. Literacy for Life connects with over 1500 individuals annually in the MD of Foothills #31. Wedidnt miss a beat even afterimmersion intoone of the most devastatingdisasters in Canadas history - Southern Alberta Flood 2013.Our core programs continued and as noted in subsequent points we continue to grow.

The programs are open to all families within the MD with the understanding that all families are vulnerable depending on the diverse factors that impact a familys life.Literacy and learning is a lifetime process. But, it is very important to have impact on children in the early years. It is never too late and never too early...Family literacy programs provide parents with ideas, tools and strategies that build on the strengths of the family, helping them to help their children through the different stages. Family literacy programs also build literacy and essential skills in all members of the family across the age continuum.As it is never too late it is also important that service are available to support adult learners that have a more specific focus on the nine essential skills -reading, writing, numeracy, oral communication, document use, technology, thinking, working with others and life long learning.Our core programs range from:Books for BabiesProgram - Within 48 hours of a childs birth the parents receive a bag with books and information on the importance of reading to their baby.They also receive another book and more information at the childs 18 month marker.Parent and preschooloral language and early readiness group programsNatured Kids - 10 week outside program for parents and children aged 3 to 5.

It is managed by the non-profit Lougheed House Conservation Society.We tell diverse stories about the past which helps us all to understand our community and our place in it.

We have asked for help a few times before, and hope you can help to get us on our feet while I recover. I have a chronic illness, and latest round has hit me hard.Yes, a delivery tomorrow morning would be perfect. Sorry about the delay in responding - have been really sick and not able to sit up for email. Thanks again. Thank you so much for the food and good wishes. Im not able to eat much right now, but my children have already picked out whats for dinner for them and my husband.You guys keep me going, really. I am so grateful.Some news. My illness has become life-threatening and I came about 10 minutes away from bleeding to death in hospital last week. Twice. And then they still couldnt get it under control in the OR. Its been a very hard week coming to terms with the seriousness of my condition and the experience of saying goodbye to my children in case I didnt survive (thats a conversation Ive never rehearsed, and it was hard. And my child wanted to talk about yogurt because shes cute and still so little). Im home now, and very weak and sick.My husband is exhausted and afraid. My children are stressed. I dont know why Im telling you except that you have always helped me and I have just begun to process what has happened.Can we please ask for more food? My husband and children like everything but soup. Im eating only soup. I like the vegetable soup and convince myself its helping to make me stronger.Can I ask you something? I know my husband wouldnt qualify for help, but if I die can you at least keep him and my children fed for a couple of weeks? Hell need support and we dont have anyone and Id like to be able to tell him to email you.There is always hope, so please send good vibes / energy / thoughts my way. Maybe this is the hard part well look back on when things are better. Thanks for listening. I hope it wasnt too much.Be well.                                                                         - Those are just a few of Sarahs emails to our team over the past couple of months.

We believe that our services are vital to providing aid to the socially, physically, emotionally and/or financially distressed families in our community.","Made by Momma is able to provide the assistance and support needed to maintain a familys physical and emotional health during difficult life situations. The families we assist have one thing in common; they are dealing with challenges and facing times of adversity. Some are dealing with illness, some are grieving the loss of a child or spouse, some struggle with post-partum depression, some are struggling to adjust to the demands of newborn twins or triplets, and some have lost their means of income. Whatever the reason, these families need to gather their strength to overcome the hurdles they face, and when faced with a crisis, families often do not have the means to plan and prepare healthy meals. Made by Momma believes wholesome nutrition is vital, especially during lifes more challenging phases.Sincelosing my husband, a month after giving birth to our youngest daughter, Ivebeen faced with a verydifficult road.We builtour life on what I thought was a solid foundation, only to have that foundationcrack and crumble.

Being a mother to infants and young children can be stressful and exhausting. Add post-partum depression, physical illness, multiple births, or a family tragedy into the equation and the result can be devastating. Our clients tell us the wholesome meals, kind words and helping hands our volunteers provide make a huge difference in their lives.We felt a strong need to pay it forward and Made by Momma was conceived. A warm batch of muffins, a hot meal, a box of baby clothing or a visit from a new friend may not change the world...or could it?Made by Momma began as a small group of women with big ideas to help make the lives of struggling moms in our community a little bit easier with some practical peer-to-peer support.

"179",631,"Make-A-Wish® Foundation of Southern Alberta","Outgoing, inquisitive, intelligent, engaging, talkative  these are just a few words wed use to describe Connolly, a 10-year old boy, who had his once-in-a-lifetime wish granted.Connolly went through brain surgery after being diagnosed with a tumour on his brain stem, hydrocephalus (excess fluid on his brain) and syrinx (a fluid-filled cavity in his spinal cord). Connollys condition was discovered when one of his brothers (Connolly and his brothers are triplets) suffered a concussion in a hockey game and entered a concussion study group at the Alberta Childrens Hospital in Calgary. Connolly was asked to participate in the study as the healthy baseline brain which they would compare to the concussed brain. The MRI on Connollys brain led to the discovery of his serious medical conditions.Despite his diagnosis, Connolly never gave up his love of hockey and his wish was to join the Winnipeg Jets NHL team. He was especially excited to meet his favourite player, Adam Lowry. Connolly was adamant that his brothers be included in his wish experience and every time he was asked about his wish he requested that his brothers be able to do the same things he would be doing. When we asked Connolly why he wanted to include his brothers in all aspects of his wish, he said, I love them and also I didnt want them to feel left out as they are Jets fans too, though not as big a fan as me.Connolly, along with his brothers and their parents, travelled to Winnipeg, where they were greeted at the airport by Mick E. Moose, a mascot sent by the Jets to welcome Connolly to the city.Later, Chevy, the General Manager of the Jets, welcomed Connolly to the team and signed him to a two-day NHL contract, making Connolly the youngest Winnipeg Jet in the teams history! Connollys mom said that watching her son on the ice, practicing with the Jets and hanging out with his new teammates was a priceless experience and definitely helped Connolly get over the loss of his own hockey season due to his health issues.According to Connolly and his family, the entire weekend was more than we could ever have hoped for, or dreamed of.Connolly is doing well and his family hopes that he will be able to play hockey in the upcoming season. His mom Aisling said that the memories of his wish experience help improve his mood, even on his toughest days.Thank you to the Winnipeg Jets for their generosity and for making Connollys wish an unforgettable experience.When a wish is granted, it does much more than bring joy to a childs heart. For kids like Connolly, who are faced with life-threatening medical conditions, a wish-come-true provides them with strength to battle through darkness and gives them hope for healthier, happier days ahead.Be part of the magic and transform the lives of children facing life-threatening medical conditions.

"181",558,"McMan Youth, Family and Community Services Association of Calgary & Area","Ill always remember that Friday, says Jeanelle with a smile. I just remember feeling like I was home and never wanted to leave. Just nine days after the birth of her daughter, Jeanelle moved into Trinity House, a safe place to live for young mothers and their children while they access program supports.Twenty two year old Jeanelle made life changing decisions those long and scary days in hospital when her daughter was born. Having tested positive for drugs, Jeanelle nearly lost her daughter in those early days, but was referred to the Youth Transitions to Adulthood (YTA) program and was given a last chance to prove she could turn things around. Since that day, Jeanelle continues to fight for herself and her daughter; living sober and building the life she had yearned for as a child.Having grown up in foster care, Jeanelle knew that was not the life she wanted for her little girl. Neither were the abusive, unhealthy relationships that clouded her own life. It made me realize that if I were to continue hanging around those people, the drugs, getting tossed around, where would I be? Where would my daughter be?Jeanelle now looks to figuring out how to juggle late night feedings with online classes and finding a daycare as her daughter grows so she can look for work. Being a parent doesnt come with a manual and a willingness to learn has made all the difference. Being vulnerable and asking for help is one of the hardest things someone can do and Jeanelle has done that with such grace shares youth worker Chelsi, who has been working with Jeanelle since she joined the program. Going from living in a random vehicle, on the street, to maintaining a home and parenting her daughter, Jeanelles transformation in such a short time is nothing short of incredible.Confident, yet humble, Jeanelle now knows what it means to work hard and see the results of those efforts. My daughter is with the woman that gave birth to her, that fought for her and Im ready to do whatever it takes to continue focusing on whats best for both of us.Jeanelles story is just one of more than 2400 lives of children, youth and families transformed each year through McMan Calgary  Areas more than 20 programs and support services that evoke positive changes and improve the quality of our communities.","On November 15 1975, Norah McNamara, John Meston, Jim Allers and Rick Newcombe, four graduates of Grant MacEwan College, opened a group home in the inner city of Edmonton. With a vision to evoke change and contribute to the community, these individuals sought to provide support to young people who required care.The young people in that first group home were cared for within a family and home-like environment. The individual interests of the young people were fostered and visits with family were encouraged and supported. For these young people, the group home was not a placement. Nor was it just a place to live. It was a true home; a safe and caring place in which each of them was given the opportunity to realize whatever unique potential of body, mind and spirit they possessed.This vision ultimately resulted in the foundation of McMan Youth, Family and Community Services Association as we know it today, a multi-regional organization serving vulnerable children, youth and families.Despite our evolution, the most important things have remained the same. Guided and inspired by the passion and vision of our founders, McMan has grown into a strong and vibrant agency that remains committed to empowering people to build brighter futures and strong communities. Our Strategic Direction is focused on enhancing our services, expanding programs to address gaps in services and meet community needs and continuing to grow our expertise to ensure McMan Calgary  Area remains a leader in evidence based practices.During the 2015-16 fiscal year, McMan Calgary  Area staff provided 35,500 service hours across more than 20 programs. Of the 1200 clients we directly supported, highlights of our work making a difference in the community include:48 homeless youth were provided safe and supportive housing;161 youth participated in groups to enhance their social skills and self-esteem;51 mothers increased their knowledge of the effects of drug and alcohol use during pregnancy;206 parents with children with a disability learned strategies to keep their child safe at home and in the community;and 61 parents improved their capacity to care for their children.On average, clients received 350 days of support and encouragement while working to achieve their full potential as members of their community which, since 1975, remains McMans mission and the foundation of our programs and services.","McMan Youth, Family and Community Services Association of Calgary  Area delivers more than 20 programs that evoke positive changes and improve the quality of our community.Each year, more than 2,400 individuals are enriched by our services, which focus on family and caregiver support, youth and outreach services, homelessness and housing support, support for families with children with disabilities, and support for individuals and families affected by Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD).

"182",644,"MEOW Foundation","Puddecombe was spotted by one of MEOW Foundations community cat caregivers in early March 2013. She took one look at him and knew he was in rough shape. Puddy, as he came to be called, was rushed to an emergency veterinary clinic where we learned he had likely been hit by a car and left for dead. His jaw was broken in two places and he needed surgery to repair the damage. He would also need extensive post-operative care while he healed.Thanks to MEOW, Puddecombe was able to receive life-saving surgery and specialized care in a loving foster home. Despite the daily challenges of recovering from head trauma and living with his jaw wired shut, Puddecombe persevered, regaining his strength with each passing day.Five months later, his jaw had healed and hed successfully relearned how to eat, use his litterbox and play. Hed also regained his energy and would run around with his foster siblings until they were all tuckered out.Puddecombe is now living life to the fullest, happy to have been matched with a wonderful adoptive family who loves him unconditionally.At MEOW Foundation, we work hard to ensure each cat who comes through our doors is matched with the best possible home based on his or her personality, history, habits and individual needs. We are passionate about delivering best-in-class programs to our community and are dedicated to providing every cat with the very best care.We believe that through the dedication and compassion of people across the planet, we will create a society that respects all animals with whom we share the world. Together, we can Make Each One Wanted.","MEOW Foundation was founded in the year 2000 by 11 passionate volunteers brought together by their concern for the welfare of stray and abandoned cats in Calgary.At the time, the majority of cats in local shelters faced euthanasia. The MEOW 11 set out to create an alternative model of animal welfare - a model where no cat would be killed.And so, MEOW Foundation was born.Soon, MEOW opened a cageless shelter with a no-kill mandate and became well known for its expertise in cat behaviour as well as its evidence-based humane programs to reduce cat overpopulation. More than 15 years later, MEOW has become a mainstay of the Calgary charitable landscape and is one of the most respected feline-focused organizations in Canada.Each year, we help more than 2,000 cats and kittens.With your help, we hope to continue providing support to Calgarys stray and abandoned felines.OUR VISION:All communities caring for every cat with respect and compassion.OUR GUIDING PRINCIPLES: No-Kill Philosophy:We believe in a no-kill model of animal welfare.Standard of Care:We believe every cat, whether young or old, social or shy, in good health or poor deserves a good life. Every cat is to be provided with the medical care, support and love necessary to thrive.Happy Homes:We are committed to ensuring every cat finds its perfect match in a family or community home.Community:We will work with animal welfare organizations and community members to end cat homelessness.Volunteerism:Volunteers are at the heart of everything we do.OUR GOALS:To work with the public to care for and provide shelter to stray, abandoned and feral cats in Calgary;To provide the highest level of care to every cat who enters our programs and immediate veterinary treatment to sick or injured cats;To match adoptable cats with loving families who will provide them with care and attention for the rest of their natural lives;To promote responsible pet ownership, including the spaying/neutering of all cats and kittens; provision of nutritious food, water, shelter, love, regular health care and permanent identification such as a microchip or tattoo; licensing; and prevention from becoming a nuisance;To reduce feline overpopulation and suffering;To promote humane treatment, compassion and respect for all animals.OUR RESULTS (2014-2015):MEOW Foundation continues to maintain a financially stable organization through the hard work of staff and volunteers, making the most of every dollar that we receive from donors and grantors. Looking to the future, the Board has been busy working on several significant steps towards our goal of moving the shelter operations into our new building. We have been working with both local architects as well as shelter specialists from the United States on the design of the new shelter. Below are some of our numbers from July 1, 2014 to June 30, 2015:1,469 Subsidized Spay and Neuter Surgeries645 Cat and Kitten Adoptions75 Trap Neuter Return CatsDear MEOW (A Testimonial):This has been our third Christmas with our beautiful cat Jayce (aka The Red Rocket Anarchist Cat). We wanted to take a moment to thank MEOW Foundation and to let you know that we have been very happy to have him in our lives. He adds daily fun and laughter with his antics. He loves his bed and usually sleeps with his favourite toy - a stuffed unicorn. He also looks for high places to hang out, often sitting on his scratching perch or other fun places so he can watch what everyone is doing.","MEOW Foundation is the only rescue organization in Calgary offering the three core programs necessary to reduce and ultimately eliminate the homeless cat overpopulation problem. Together, our programs control the cat population at the source and actively promote responsible pet ownership.OUR THREE CORE PROGRAMS:Rescue and Adoption:At any given time, MEOW provides shelter and daily care to 150 cats and kittens awaiting loving adoptive homes. All cats that come through our doors are spayed/neutered, vaccinated and given permanent microchip identification. Our Adoption Specialists work diligently to match each cat with a home that best suits his or her personality and needs.Spay Neuter Assistance Program (SNAP):SNAP helps low-income Calgarians cover the costs of feline spay and neuter surgeries - and when sextuplets are the norm, these surgeries play a big role in reducing pet homelessness. In the past year alone, SNAP has helped pay for more than 1,500 surgeries.Trap Neuter Return (TNR):Our TNR program humanely traps, spays or neuters, and microchips feral cats living in Calgary communities. These cats are then returned to their neighbourhoods where trained community caregivers provide them with stable sources of food, water and shelter.Our unique multi-faceted approach has had a significant positive impact on cats and pet owners in Calgary. Over the past 10 years, local organizations have seen a decline in stray cats and have noted a marked increase in the number of cats who come through their doors already spayed or neutered. But with thousands of cats still on the streets, there is still lots of work to do. Please help us continue to provide community programs that save lives.","We are a grassroots organization and to say we love cats in an understatement.

"183",702,"Miistakis Institute","When it comes to solving a complex array of conservation issues, Albertans have a lot of questions. For example, what is the financial impact of wildlife on beef producers? What tools do municipalities need to effectively adapt to the impacts of climate change? Should we reintroduce beavers in some areas to increase watershed resiliency in Alberta? How do you stop animals from dying on highways and simultaneously increase highway safety for people?Whether its by conducting and effectively communicating robust science and research, or through community engagement and strategic planning, Miistakiis has a long history of getting individuals and organizations what they need to make real progress on habitat and wildlife conservation issues. Our work aims to inform decision-making, ultimately putting conservation in the hands of the people.Miistakis is routinely viewed as an honest broker of information and advice.- Lorne Fitch, P. Biol., Adjunct Professor, Faculty of Environmental Design, University of CalgaryMiistakis is highly regarded in the community and respected for the unique and diverse array of skills and tools they offer. They are often a go-to organization for philanthropic foundations looking for expert opinions on the environment and for help as a high-performing research organization.-Pat Letizia, Executive Director of Alberta Ecotrust.","The Miistakis Institute specializes in working on complex environmental problems that require equally diverse skill sets and tools to resolve them.Working closely with governments, industry and the nonprofit sector, the Miistakis Institute is an important neutral third party with specialized skill sets in: spatial analysis, private land conservation, road ecology, market based instruments, wildlife management, citizen science, and ecosystem services. These skills are often critical in supporting environmental policy development and land use and watershed planning, and many of their staff are considered experts in their field.- Pat Letizia, Executive Director of Alberta EcotrustWorking together is the key to success. Were proud of the relationships weve built with numerous organizations that have ultimately resulted in healthier landscapes for people and wildlife. For example, our work with communities and government to identify and mitigate wildlife mortality and road safety issues along Highway 3 and Highway 1 led to an important relationship with Alberta Transportation that will see long-term conservation actions taken.Alberta Transportation has finally acknowledged that vehicle/wildlife collisions are a significant aspect of safer roads in Alberta, and the reports that [Miistakis] did along Hwy 3 and Highway 1 are considered the guiding documents over the next few years as the Traffic Safety Plan 2020 is implemented.-Don Snider, Alberta Transportation (now retired)----As we develop tools, we share them with other organizations to make their efforts more efficient and cost effective. For example, Our Road Watch on-line mapping tool (used to monitor where wildlife cross highways safely and where they are being hit) was built on an open-source platform and has now been replicated several times across the globe.Another example is our Conservation Easement Web Resource.Conservation easements can be a powerful tool for landowners looking to fulfill long-term conservation goals on their property. To use this tool, landowners need access to basic information:What are conservation easements, and what are the benefits?Who are the eligible conservation easement holders in Alberta, where do they operate, and what are their priorities?How and where can this tool be used creatively?We created this web site so Albertas landowners can answer these questions for themselves.","At Miistakis, our approach is to first identify the information gaps and the needs of those working on the issue. Working with partners and people on the ground, we then succinctly define the problem and the appropriate course of action required to solve it.We employ seven conservation professionals with a range of backgrounds and expertise including spatial analysis, research design, web-based mapping, fiscal analysis, land stewardship, community engagement, communications and wildlife ecology. This diverse set of skills allows us to be strategic, creative and nimble with the environmental challenges we face today.----We also work with academic and creative professionals outside of Miistakis in order to explore new ways to share information. For example. Miistakis partnered with award-winning filmmaker Leanne Allison to create a documentary (highwaywilding.org) that highlighted the innovations now available to design roadways with both animals and people in mind. The film was a screened at four international film festivals and was seen by over 70,000 people, proving itself as a potent vehicle for bolstering highway mitigation for wildlife from both environmental and economic perspectives.When you look at the movements of grizzly bear 122 this summer he traveled over 1600 km and crossed the Trans-Canada Highway (using wildlife crossing structures) over 66 times. These crossing structures were part of his daily life.-Jesse Whittington - Ecologist Banff National Park","Wetlands play a significant role in improving water quality and water quantity, and supporting climate change mitigation and adaptation. Despite their value, wetlands continue to be degraded and lost due to habitat loss, fragmentation, pollution and climate change. In Calgary, 90% of pre-settlement wetlands have been lost. Wetland losses significantly impact biodiversity and ecosystem services important to human well being. Action is needed by all stakeholders to maintain and restore wetlands in and around the City of Calgary. Tied to this, there is a strong need to better understand the health of Calgarys wetlands, and to foster wetland stewardship activities.To address this need the Miistakis Institute has designed a citizen science program called Call of the Wetland to document observations and calls from amphibians in Calgary wetlands.Citizen science is a powerful approach to enable organizations to meet multiple goals simultaneously. Call of the Wetland aims to better understand the conservation of wetlands in an urban setting though monitoring of amphibians as an important indicator species, while also fostering wetland champions who are willing to take action to protect, maintain or restore wetlands. By engaging citizens in the monitoring process, we not only improve scientific literacy but the two-way flow of information about wetlands and the need for their protection. The positive impact within our community is therefore enhanced knowledge of Calgarys natural environment in an urban setting as well as an increased number of people focused on maintaining or restoring wetlands and amphibian species within Calgary.Call of the Wetland will be launched in Spring 2017. We are seeking additional resources to continue to support a local coordinator who will recruit new volunteers and work with volunteers to submit amphibian observations and to support the citizen science data collection tools.

"185",701,"Missing Children Society of Canada","Police receive over 41,000 reports of missing children annually; thats equivalent of one child every 12 minutes. On average, 200 are abduction cases, thousands are disappearances and over 30,000 children are considered at risk runaways (who we now refer to as Vulnerable Youth) who will face extreme challenges and dangerous situations once away from their home, including drugs, violence, human trafficking and homelessness.Whether it is a disappearance, a parental abduction or a vulnerable youth, Missing Children Society of Canada supports families throughout their most unimaginable experience. The following is one familys journey with the Missing Children Society of Canada: One Closed File was 16 Years in the Making Two young siblings were reunited with their searching family in British Columbia after 16 long, difficult years. The brother and sister - whose names we are keeping confidential out of respect for their privacy - were abducted by their non-custodial mother. At the tender ages of 5 and 2, the young children were stolen away to the United States, beginning what would be a very long and damaging ordeal.There was great concern for their physical health and safety - including the young girls serious heart condition going untreated throughout the entire abduction. There was also the unimaginable emotional devastation forced upon them and their searching family. From the beginning, Missing Children Society of Canada had been actively investigating their abduction, following up on tips and connecting with the searching family.Nearly 16 years exactly to the day, we were thrilled to be able to successfully close this active investigation and bring these children home to safety.We cant do this work alone, explained Ted Davis, Investigator with MCSC. The RCMP were very cooperative with us on this case, which speaks to the strong working relationship we have built with our law enforcement partners over the past 28 years. With the hope of creating a neutral mediator, the family was hesitant to have direct police involvement and approached us for help. Our law enforcement partners were open to working with us in this way, and as a result we were able to move the investigation forward and successfully reunite this family.Yet our involvement in this familys journey is far from over. We will continue to support the family and the reunited young adults through the reunification process, including access to our Family Support Program. All of our services are provided free-of-charge to our searching families.The siblings, now young adults, are living back in their home in British Columbia. They are both doing very well -renewing their relationship with their fathers and updating their education.It has been a great relief to keep in touch with them and offer support during the reunification process.We are always thrilled to hear news from them on how theyouths are happily adjusting and reconnecting with their family and loved ones.","The disappearance of six-year-old Tania Murrell from Edmonton, Alberta, in 1983 was one of the first high profile cases of a missing child in Canada. The search for Tania received national media attention and inspired the first non-profit agencies to open their doors to help missing children and their families. These agencies focused primarily on public awareness and prevention programs. Search support was limited to basic poster distribution.Seeking to take a more active role, the Founder of the Missing Children Society of Canada (MCSC) obtained training and licensing in conducting investigations in 1985. She founded MCSC in 1986 subsequently developing a comprehensive investigative program staffed with former police officers who could assist both police and parents in the active and ongoing search for missing children.In 2010, the MCSC Board of Directors completed a full organizational assessment confirming that MCSC continued to be uniquely positioned to provide investigation support. Additionally, they recognized that by working on cases for over 23 years, two critical factors affected every case of a missing child: Time  Anonymity. MCSC determined that addressing these factors would have a significant impact on successfully locating and safely returning children.Our MissionTo return missing children to a safe haven through professional investigations, emergency response, public awareness and family support programs.Our VisionAll missing children returned to a safe haven and the elimination of child abduction in Canada.Our Results (2014-15):Our investigators worked on a total of 190 registered files, closing132 of them.In the last year we were able to engage tens of thousands ofCanadians in the search by highlighting over 600 vulnerable missing youth.In September 2014, our CEO Amanda Pick was recognized as one of Canadas Top 12Innovators at Work by the Globe and Mail for her efforts to lead the development ofMilk Carton 2.0.Weve partnered with police across the country and are honouredto report that while endorsed federally, our program is being implementened in major metropolitan police forces such as the Toronto Police Service.","Professional InvestigationsMCSCs specialized investigators offer the full range of support services involved in investigating a missing child case, from date of disappearance to the reunification process.

"186",139,"Momentum Community Economic Development Society","Our city has a strong tradition of giving our neighbours a hand up and creating new ideas and opportunities in the process; we have pride in ourselves and in each other. But even in the midst of a thriving city like Calgary, we also see poverty close at hand. Over 100,000 Calgarians live in poverty  more than the population of St. Johns, Newfoundland.Research now shows that it would cost Albertans less to eliminate poverty than it costs to simply alleviate the consequences. In fact, a recent report concluded that poverty costs Albertans $20M a day. There is a much more desirable alternative: reduce poverty now and prevent it in the future. We cant waste the potential that our neighbours have to offer.By connecting people to their dreams, Momentum contributes to a flourishing community and economy. Momentum understands the complexities of living life on a low income and we honour the knowledge, skills and ambition of people that come through our doors by creating opportunities for them to contribute.","We partner with individuals who are ready to move out of poverty, for good. They become the small business owner on your favourite street, the pipefitter working on the new downtown high-rise you drive by each day, or your next hire who could finally afford her college diploma. Our goal is for everyone in Calgary to have the assets they need to get ahead in life, and contribute back to the community.We also take what we learn from our participants and look at the bigger picture: what causes people to fall into poverty in the first place? We work with and through others seeking broad-based change in policies and systems, so that everyone can participate in a thriving local economy.25 Years of Momentum:$2.4Mhas beenloaned to localentrepreneurs insupport of theirsmall businesses;70%of trades traininggraduates areemployed in theirfield 6 monthsafter graduation;135families bought their own homeswith matchedsavings2015 Year in Review:The economic downturn made 2015 a challenging year forTrades Training program staff.

Participants write a business plan, learn from others in business and access micro-loans from Momentum. From bakeries, bike maintenance, and pet grooming to importing and fashion  the 70 entrepreneurs who will launch a business this year through a Momentum program are creating a healthy local economy and putting their talent and knowledge to work.The Trades Training program connects immigrants and Aboriginal persons with high-demand careers in the Trades. Safari, one of Momentums Trades participants, went from working on a chicken farm to being a skilled Glazier. The program meets the needs of unemployed or under-employed people, as well as those of industry.Our free Financial Literacy workshops empower people to take control of their money  even while living on a limited income. To date, over 20,000 individuals have taken our Money Management workshops. Our Matched Savings programs fuel hope for the future. Over 100 families have become new home-owners through these programs and hundreds of others have used their savings for university or college or purchased the tools they need to work.We are also taking what we have learned and spreading the word. We train 20 new organizations a year to deliver our programming. We sit on the committees that make recommendations for municipal and provincial poverty reduction strategies. We support financial institutions as they seek to better serve those who often fall through the cracks.","Your investment in Momentum ensures we can directly partner with 4,000 Calgarians a year as they find their path towards a sustainable livelihood. This might mean operating a thriving business, having a rewarding career in the Trades, or even purchasing a new home. And the return on investment for Calgary is huge. Business owners create employment and income for others. Parents save for their childrens education and invest in our future work force. Home owners pay taxes and become a part of our neighbourhoods. These people create untold value and a better future for our city.You can also help us spread the word: write a story about Momentum, talk to us about how to integrate Community Economic Development into public policy, and mention us to potential participants.This work is made possible by people like you. You know what it is like to be given an opportunity to grow and improve your livelihood  and want others to have that opportunity as well.

"187",355,"Mountain Standard Time Performative Art Festival Society","M:ST was originally conceived and created by The New Gallery, one of Canadas oldest artist-run centres, to produce a bi-annual performance art festival. The term performance art describes art practices that originate from a visual or media arts background and involve the live presence of the artist. It can include happenings, public interventions, culture jamming, video, film, spoken word, installation, or live web streaming.Earlier festivals and events from the 1970s onward (Workshop, Space for Space, Ex.120) reflected the support of a growing and diverse local performative arts community. Building on this tradition, the first M:ST was organized to celebrate this established arts community by presenting works from local artists alongside visiting artists from across Canada and the world. Spanning the month of April 2001, M:ST 1 featured over 30 artists presenting work within Calgarys urban landscape. M:ST 1 included workshops, lectures and panel discussions and created important dialogue between local, national and international artists.As a result of the overwhelming success of the festival, M:ST was established as a biennial event. Since 2001 weve continure to grow. Aside from the bi-annual festival M:ST also presents interim programming. This started in 2004 with M:ST 2.5 Grand Action, a three day seminar event that included studio visits at the Banff Centre, a panel discussion at the Alberta College of Art + Design, as well as a comunity party and networking session. In 2005, M:ST 3 expanded to a regionally-based event, including the participation of the Southern Alberta Art Gallery in Lethbridge and the Walter Phillips Gallery in Banff.Since 2001 the M:ST festival has brought the works of over 250 artists to the Southern Alberta area. We collaborate with Arts Commons, Southern Alberta Art Gallery, Alberta College of Art + Design, TRUCK Gallery, Stride Gallery, The New Gallery, The Nickle Galley, Calgary Society of Independant Filmmakers, and EMMEDIA to create a uniquely collaborative and participatory environement. This collaborative structure allows the festival to represent each organizations mandate and audience, while providing opportunities for cross-disciplinary and inter-organizational exchange. The result is a unique participatory context, where artists and audience experience contemporary performative work outside of more traditional festival or gallery models.Our objective is to showcase original, diverse, entertaining, andthought-provoking performative works. The term performative describes practices thatoriginate from a visual or media arts discourse and involve the live presence of the artist. Presenting a wide range of media, M:STs programming is responsive to issues incontemporary art, fostering discourse crucial for the growth and progression ofperformative practices and promoting dialogue through panel discussions, workshops,and dissemination activities.","The mission of M:ST is to ensure that performative art practices are recognized and sustained in the Southern Alberta region. M:ST fosters innovation and collaboration among local, national and international artistic communities.M:ST is committed to presenting performative works from a variety of disciplinesthat reflect current issues and practices in contemporary art.

"188",603,"Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada - Calgary & Area Chapter","My name is Fiona Fifield and I was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis in September of 2005.During the May long-weekend of that same year, I was hit by a drunk driver. My symptoms started a few weeks after the crash. Prior to my diagnosis, I had spent three weeks in the hospital with a kidney infection, lost most of the strength in my left leg, as well as the loss of colour vision in my right eye. My diagnosis solidified what we were sadly thinking but not saying.In my first few months, I found how fast my disease was progressing. I had my first MRI and the results shocked everyone. I had 16 lesions, four of them active disease. I had my second MRI two months later and was up to 19, with seven active lesions.How I was feeling in those first few months? I was terrified! I didnt understand why my disease was so different from others in my family. My mom had Progressive MS and it slowly progressed over 30 years before she needed a wheelchair. My sister had Remitting Relapsing MS and had been doing well. Whereas I felt like I was racing to stay ahead of the freight train bearing down on me. Within two months, I had to move out of my basement suite as I was no longer able to climb the stairs. Within six months, I had lost my balance.In my first four years living with MS, I failed three different disease modifying treatments including Cyclophosphamide, a form of Chemotherapy. In the fourth year I had paralysis from my waist down for six months. The doctors tried a Plasma Exchange during my time in Foothills Hospital. It also did nothing. The Chemotherapy did get me walking again, I was promised a year. I was told that when it stopped working there was nothing left they could do for me. The drug started to wear off within eight months. At this point my diagnosis changed to Marburg Variants, the only terminal form of MS. I went to bed on the 8th of April while still being able to pivot myself into bed from my wheelchair and awoke completely paralyzed from my breastbone down. I was raced into Foothills where within a week my paralysis ascended to my collarbone. I was on my deathbed due to my autonomic system starting to shut down and I was sent home and told that there were no more options for me.However, then a series of fateful situations began to fall into place for me. Within a month I was accepted at Ottawa Hospital for an experimental treatment by Dr. Freedman and Dr. Atkins. The treatment was Autologous Stem Cell Replacement. This procedure saved my life, it halted my disease which nothing else anyone had done before could do.To my knowledge, over $6 million went into the trial that turned out to have saved my life. (This trial was funded in full by the MS Society and MS Scientific Research Foundation). I wasnt a part of the trial but I was the 4th person in Canada that had the transplant outside of the trial. Dr. Freedman told me on our first visit with him that I was lucky to be the sickest of the sick. For any other person this statement may not bring joy but for this gal, who mere weeks ago had been given a zero chance of survival, I was overjoyed.I owe my life to the Doctors, the people who participated in trials before me, but most of all to the MS Society for raising all the funds that went into the research. Fundraising has saved me and now many like me. If not for the staff at the MS Society and meeting Dr. Freedman, I would not be here.I have since my transplant been a quadriplegic twice; once in 2014 and again in September of 2016. These little blimps are due to the massive damage in my system that may or may not heal over time. The nervous system is extremely complex and there is still a lot of research to be done into how it all works. I have not been able to go back to work yet. I am however attempting to change into something my body is able to handle. I do walk unaided most of the time unless fighting an infection. I am able to drive, walk, talk, and shake hands. I have been given 5 years of life that I would not have had. I enjoy meeting all the people that I would not have met if I was not here. Im excited to have found out that hair is nothing but an accessory and that I AM NOT MY BODY.","Through every area of our work  research to discover new treatments, advocacy to help people qualify for AISH or CPPD, support groups and social programs  we aim to help people live better with multiple sclerosis. Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic and often disabling disease, with no cure at present. It has a profound impact on every area of a persons life. It is unpredictable and presents in different forms. Many people can live normal lives for many years, others develop more progressive forms of the disease resulting in various degrees of paralysis. We often refer to MS as Canadas disease because:Over 100,000 Canadians live with MSCanada has the highest rate of MS in the world and we dont know whyGLOBAL LEADERS IN MS RESEARCHThrough generous contributions from donors, corporate sponsors, and fervent fundraisers, the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada has:Invested over $140 million dollars in research since its inception in 1948Canada continues to remain at the forefront of MS research around the worldMS Society funded studies have gone the distance in areas such as imaging, diagnosis, genetics, tissue repair, rehabilitation, stem cell research and disease-modifying therapies that have significant positive results for people affected by MS.With each passing year research continues to reveal new knowledge around the cause of MS, as well as the mechanism by which MS impacts the central nervous system.When the MS Society was founded, there were no treatments for those living with MS. Now, with the help of the MS Society, there are 11 different disease modifying treatments available through Alberta Health Care. However, because of the unpredictability of the disease, there is still work to be done.

"190",362,"National Music Centre","When famed Calgary blues club the King Edward Hotel closed in 2004, there was an outcry from the local and national music community. During its over 100-year existence, the Eddy had hosted icons, such as blues pioneers Pinetop Perkins and Buddy Guy and CanRock stalwart Bryan Adams, offering high-quality live music experiences while bringing people from all walks of life together. Rich or poor, black or white, politicians rubbed shoulders with music scenesters and bikers sat alongside corporate influencers. The Eddy represented the unifying power of music.At the same time as its closing, the National Music Centre (NMC) had been scouring the city for the location of its new 160,000 square-foot facility. With a mandate to preserve and celebrate Canadas music story, NMCs new home needed to be anchored by a strong music story. The King Eddy was that story and without NMC that important story would have been lost.Considered the largest artifact in NMCs collection of over 2,000 rare instruments, artifacts, sound equipment and Canadian music memorabilia, the restored King Eddy will be incorporated into the design of NMCs new home at Studio Bell, and music will once again ring through the Eddy as a live music venue.When Studio Bell opens in 2016 at the site of the historic blues club, it will continue to be sacred ground for music lovers. As the beating heart of Calgarys music scene, it will be a hub for music fans of all stripes, much like the original Eddy was for so many people in Calgary and beyond.","Opening in 2016, the new NMC at Studio Bell will be more than just a museum. It will be like a music festival experience with sound, lights and activities pouring out of 22 individual exhibition galleries (or what we like to call exhibition stages.).

I learned about throat singingwe got to dance and try throat singing. This was very cool because it is my grandmas culture. She is Inuit. I am in piano lessons now because I liked all the instruments and the way they sounded and I wanted to play my own instrument.  Reese, Grade 2 studentGuitar club means a lot to me, because jamming with many different people and learning and incorporating their styles has helped me a lot in finding my own sound. Ive learned that there are many musicians just like me who I can learn a thing or two from, and vice versa.  Kiran, Guitar Club studentI am a member ofNMCs Guitar Clubandhave been involved for almost three years. I first started going to Guitar Club, because I was sleeping outside and it was a safe and warm place for me to go with supportive people I have learned many things at Guitar Club. When I first started I couldnt play. When I listen to guitar tracks now, I can figure out theguitar parts on my own. I feel way more confident, and am able tospeak to people. I also feel less anxious and depressed.  Trizia, Guitar Club student in Grade 12Artist in Residence TestimonialsTrying out some of these keyboards is sending me to a different kind of musical space.

"191",794,"Native Addictions Services Society","I still remember the day, the minute and the corner I was at when I made that phone call to my parents......95 Street and 111 Avenue in Edmonton, Alberta. It was a block away from the crack house of where I used to live. I remember walking to the phone booth, calling my parents and I told them I give up....I dont know what to do....Im done.I needed help and we didnt even know where I could go at first or who to call, as my parents are not alcoholics or addicts and were not used to this kind of situation.....but then it came to us......AADAC (Alberta Alcohol and Drug Abuse Commission). I called ADDAC for help and entered detox on that same day in Edmonton with only the clothes on my back, which my stay was 11 days before I entered my first treatment centre.June 17, 2006, this is the day when I started my journey into sobriety. I went to 3 different treatment centres...Sunrise Native Addiction Services Society is where I learned about my culture, the power of my higher power and found many support and alumni groups to help me in my recovery. I continued for many years, even to this day and I am forever grateful for the many people I have met along the way.If it wasnt for the fellowship and support of others in recovery, I am not sure if I would still be sober and in recovery and active as I am......learning from those before me and getting involved is definitely the key to keeping my sobriety and from going back out. Paying it forward and being there when someone reaches out and to treat people with respect no matter where they come from, any situation, from my experiences, I can help others, and this is what it is all about for me.Today, I keep myself busy, thats number one but keeping myself healthy physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritually, some of the tools Sunrise taught me......also to respect myself and never be afraid to reach out and ask for help or help others when asked. This includes speaking and getting involved in support groups and making the best of our second chance at life, as some people do not make it.                                   -past client of the Inpatient Treatment Program","SUNRISE Native Addictions Services Society helps men, women, and their families recover from the destructive effects of alcohol, drug and gambling addictions.

"192",417,"Nature Conservancy of Canada (NCC)","So why do I volunteer for the Nature Conservancy of Canada?Volunteering is my way of expressing my gratitude to nature for all that she has given and shared with me. As a child, natures abundant beauty inspired me. Whether it was testing a puddle to see if my rubber boots were tall enough to cross  or being mesmerized by the cloud transformations from a rabbit to an elephant to a castle to a princess  or discovering a cocoon and learning about the fuzzy caterpillars transformation into a beautiful moth or butterfly  or tasting the sweet nectar of fresh-picked wild strawberries, raspberries and Saskatoon berries  or providing the best hiding places when my mother had a long chore list  nature never failed to entertain, capturing my heart and infusing my imagination with wondrous ideas and joy filled experiences. Soul enriching memories that as an adult I had forgotten about, that is, until I became involved in NCCs volunteer program.As an adult, I continue to wonder at the beauty of the umbers and violet hues cascading throughout her sunrises and sunsets. The walks down her numerous pathways continue to fill my soul with peace, love, hope, health, and happiness. The joyful surprise I feel while exploring and learning about something new, like when I discovered what at first appeared to be a willow branch was in fact, a baby Black Crowned Night Heron. The inspiration I feel each time I am awakened by the call of the Common Loon  or the excitement of hearing the thunder of wile horse hoofs  or the awe at viewing a multi-tiered beaver dam  or the thrills and chills that run up and down ones spine while listening to the call of a lone wolf. I am grateful to NCC for providing the opportunity and to nature for challenging me to face and conquer my fears like when I stood with weak knees between the dens of two Rattle Snakes. Nature is still my muse, my teacher and it is with heartfelt respect that I honor and treasure her gifts.So it is with respect for nature and gratitude to NCC for providing numerous and diverse opportunities for me to say, Thank you to all, for all that I have and have yet to receive.Denise Harris; March 2013","Mission:The Nature Conservancy of Canada will lead, innovate and use creativity in the conservation of Canadas natural heritage. --- We will secure important natural areas through their purchase, donation or other mechanisms, and then manage these properties for the long term.History of Organization: In the early 1960s a plucky band of naturalists based in Ontario had a bold idea. Stung by the damage to the natural world they saw all around them, they launched a program to take direct, private action to protect natural spaces and promote conservation. At the time it was an audacious plan. It was also the birth of the Nature Conservancy of Canada. Over 50 years later, NCC and its partners have conserved over 2.6 million (1 million hectares) of land from coast to coast.By investing in conservation NCC is working to ensure that our natural world remains a home for wildlife, a haven for recreation and a vital resource that cleans the air we breathe and the water we drink. Through strong partnerships NCC works to safeguard our natural areas so that our children and grandchildren will have the chance to enjoy them.Natural Legacy Through Partnership:NCC works with individuals, corporation, foundations, governments and communities to achieve tangible results  results you can walk on.Conservation For Nature - For Now, Forever:Once NCC secures a property (through donation, purchase or conservation easement), NCC is committed to the long-term care of the land. This ensures the natural areas we love will be here for future generations to enjoy.NCCs Science Based Approach to Conservation:NCC works mostly in southern Canada, where the majority of the Canadian population lives, works, plays, and competes for space with more than 80 per cent of our at risk species. It is here where the threats to nature and opportunity for conservation are the greatest.NCC Works Where You Live:With more than 200 staff, working in 7 regions and in every province, NCC brings a national perspective to conservation while working locally.NCC Is Well Managed:For four years in a row, Moneysense magazine has ranked NCC as the top environmental charity and one of the most efficient and responsible charities in Canada. 85 percent of NCCs resources go into the ground with overhead cost being kept to a five-year average of 15 percent.","Conservation Internship: NCC has a long history of providing practical, career-based training for the advancement of college and university students in the field of conservation and environmental studies. In the past decade alone, NCC has supported more than 350 internships in all 10 provinces, helping NCC to achieve its science and stewardship goals.Equally important, NCC staff mentor the young Canadians who will become tomorrows conservation leaders.To learn more about NCCs Conservation Internship program, or to apply for an internship with NCC, please click here.Leaders in Conservation:The Leaders in Conservation (LIC) programprovides unique opportunities and benefits toindividuals who make an annual contribution of $1,000 or more in support of the Nature Conservancy of Canadas work.

On May 29, 2014 a group of 20 NCC Conservation Volunteers came out to the Jenkins property in this area to demolish a bear attractant, an old grain bin, piece by piece. After tearing, hammering, shoveling and breaking the structure, the group managed to leave nothing but a shell of the original building.Volunteers also worked hard to clear out the grain. A new bear-proof metal bin will replace the old wooden bin; a disappointment for the bears, but a definite win for the Jenkins family in their efforts to reduce the number of human-bear interactions in the area.To see these NCC volunteers in action, watch:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9vmXU8EIFgfeature=youtu.belist=UUEHsITo learn more about projects like this visit: http://www.natureconservancy.ca/en/what-you-can-do/conservation-volunteers/","www.natureconservancy.ca/ab","steven.ross@natureconservancy.ca","119246544RR0001","403.444.2850","Steven Ross","21501488","park natur water conserv",192,0.0432252701579385,0.0133000831255195,0.41479634247714,0.0631753948462178,0.0432252701579385,0.028262676641729,0.0332502078137988,0.0432252701579385,0.0307564422277639,0.0955943474646717,0.055694098088113,0.0133000831255195,0.0482128013300083,0.0332502078137988,0.0407315045719036
"193",760,"Next Step Ministries Society","Abby called the Next Step Ministries emergency call line. She was desperately looking for a safe place to live and help her escape from the abuse and addiction she was currently experiencing.Becky answered the phone. There was a frantic voice at the other end as she listened to Abby urgently telling her that she was running from a life of prostitution, drug addiction and a very abusive relationship. Her life for the last 25 years had been a living hell, she was at the end of her rope and wanted out.Becky asked where Abby was and immediately got in her car to meet her at a fast food restaurant close to where she called from. When Becky arrived, there were many people in line waiting to order, but she immediately knew who Abby was. She was wearing an old pair of dirty shorts and a tank-top, her arms were marked up, she was skin and bones, her face was gaunt and had sores on them likely from drug abuse. Her eyes had a distant but desperate look in them. She couldnt stand still and was fidgety and constantly scanning the room.Becky approached her and asked if her name was Abby and if she wanted something to eat. Abby said yes, I havent had a meal in weeks. After talking to Abby for a while, it became obvious that she was full of fear and pain. Abby was on the run. Becky asked her if she wanted out, she said yes and Becky brought her to the Next Step Ministries house. When Abby walked into the house she fell on her knees and cried to God, thanking him for saving her and for providing her with a safe place.Denise, our live in volunteer, showed her the house and walked her over to her room. Immediately she started crying again. It had been years since she felt safe and had her own room with a bed in it. Abby jumped on the bed, smelled the brand new pillow and hugged the blanket. It was beautiful to see this, but it was only the first step.Over the following two days, we were able help Abby get clean underwear and some more clothes, groceries, hygiene items, and her phone changed so her abuser couldnt find her. In the weeks to come, we would also get her an ID card and set up on government financial assistance.Abby started attending a program we provide to help break the cycle of addiction and abuse in her life. She started using what she was learning. The road to recovery for Abby was extremely challenging as she worked through the abuse that started when she was a little girl until she came to next Step Ministries. Even though she was in a safe place, she lived in constant fear that her most recent abuser would find her. At times her trauma was through the roof, but she stuck with the program.She had a couple of slips, as most people do, but she was able to push through and has been clean and sober for 8 months. She has reconnected with her family and was able to get her children back in her life. She is determined to succeed and continues to go to Narcotics Anonymous meetings. She is doing what it takes to continue on the path of recovery and to ensure she never goes back to how her life was. Abby stays connected with us on a weekly basis and is now planning and figuring out what is next for her in life.As we walk alongside women fighting so hard to escape their lives of sexual exploitation, their stories may vary, but they all come from a place of trauma and darkness. They are desperately searching for a way to live life with dignity and safety. Like all of us, they want to feel like they belong, they want to be good friends, good parents, good members of our community. They want to matter.","Our Vision is for women to exit sexual exploitation and discover their identity.Next Step Ministries is a Christian organization that was established in 2010 by Phil and Jackie Reimer to help meet the needs of vulnerable and exploited people in the community of Calgary. Today, Next Step Ministries has four programs that work together to help women exit sexual exploitation and move toward a life of hope and healing.Our Mission is to walk alongside women exiting sexual exploitation as they break the cycle of addiction and abuse.The need is larger than what we first realized. In 2014, the City of Calgary put out a report called the Prostitution Response Framework, which states that there are as many as 3,000 prostitutes in Calgary. This, along with an unrelenting stream of women coming into our program has led Next Step Ministries to increase our capacity over the years in order to serve as many women as possible. With one house and the current size of our Day Program, we have been able to work with 30 individual women per year. With a second house to come online shortly, we will be able to significantly increase that number.Our Goal is to have a safe place for every woman who wants to exit sexual exploitation. Our Participants come to us facing many challenges. Each one of them has a history of being sexually exploited, close to 95% of the women come with a history of substance abuse, 100% require mental health support for diagnosable conditions (bipolar, depression, PTSD, and anxiety are the most common trends), they have a long list of physical challenges, and 93% come with criminal records and have an extensive history with law enforcement.We track measurable outcomes for the women, but our ultimate desire when they leave Next Step Ministries is that they know that they are loved by God, loved by our team and that they have choices in life.","Our programs at Next Step Ministries are designed to help the Participants recover from their past and move forward with hope into their future. This happens through demonstrating healthy relationships from both our staff and volunteers as they walk alongside them. We have four specific programs that represent our system of care for the women.The Outreach Program meets women exiting sexual exploitation where they are at, helping them access resources and create an exit plan for those ready to move forward.The Housing Program provides second stage housing for women exiting sexual exploitation. They are given their own room with a key so they have a safe place to call their own.While the women are in the Housing Program, they attend classes in the Day Program four days a week where they work on recovery and life skills, which is all facilitated through a trauma informed lens.We offer a long term Follow Care Program, which helps the women get jobs, permanent housing and follow their educational goals. Participants are able to access staff support at any time.","Next Step Ministries relies heavily on our many supporters. We cant do it without our community working with us on this issue.

"194",476,"North East Family Connections Society","Carol and Bill* were nervous about their first appointment, and understandably so. Both recently out of jail, they were trying to find their way in a world that had not been kind. They had gone through a detoxification program and had recently received guardianship of Bills children. The children, Scott and Bobby, two active boys, ages 10 and 11 had been in the care of their birth mother and various temporary placements for over two years. The younger boy, having some developmental disabilities, was most severely affected by the separation and the whole family was struggling with all aspects of life.The Registered Social Worker at North East Family Connections, drawing on her personal and professional expertise, knew just how to assist this family and designed both short-term and long-term case plans to assist.Immediate needs were addressed with access to the NEFC onsite pantry and clothing room as well as referrals to community based Agencies that will assist monthly until the family gets back on their feet.North East Family Connections also laid out a long-term plan.This plan included successfully finding tuition funding for the youngest boy to attend a school suited to his special needs. They were also able to recommend enrollment to a partner Agency for a long-term financial assistance program to help with clothing, school fees, sports and opportunities for the boys to reach their full potential.Bill has been set up with an employment counselor, and though still struggling, has been able to find part time work.Carol successfully found full work while using the public computers and resume writing assistance available at NEFC.She continues to embrace her new role as the family earner and Bill has enrolled in parenting classes offered at NEFC. He is also going to attend the Financial Literacy training offered by the staff as well.With just one phone call and the guidance of a compassionate and caring Agency, this family is well on their way to finding stability for themselves and their children and their new journey to happiness and productivity has begun. One phone call, one appointment, one path to a better life begins.North East Family Connections (NEFC) provides insight, referrals, programs and knowledge to assist families on their journey to becoming a stronger, more resilient family.*These are not their real names (Carol and Bill) as we wish to protect the privacy of our clients.","NEFC provides professional assessment services to assist families understand their root causes of their issues, provides services and programs to help address those problems and follow - up services to maintain families on their path to resiliency and betterment.

NEFC provides services to address the needs of families in the communities of Falconridge, Castleridge, Coral Springs, Martindale, Monterey Park, Pineridge, Redstone, Rundle, Saddleridge, Skyview Ranch, Taradale, Temple and Whitehorn.Since 1998 we have assisted 79,410 people; either through the intake and referral process, on site programs, partner groups running on site, the computer lab or the fax, photocopy services.We have been hosting a Christmas Hamper Depot in partnership with the Calgary Food Bank at the Full Gospel Church since 2006. This depot is fully manned by volunteers from the Board of the NEFC, staff, youth and friends of the NEFC. Having the depot at the Church allows the families in the area access to their food hampers without having to drive to the main depot, which at Christmas time can be an added burden to them.","Our programs include Domestic Violence Impact programs  Family Parenting and counselling. In partnership with various city agencies, we offer many parent centered programming including Magic Carpet Ride, Motherhood Matters, Cross Cultural Parenting, Nobodys Perfect, art programs, referrals and more. Parents often struggle with how to make sure their children are getting enough play time with those their own age. Magic Carpet Ride offers many opportunities for children of the same age (3 - 5 years) to play, read, create art, eat, and spend time together. The best part of the program is that it is free and in the community.Teenagers can be particularly trying for some parents.

"195",557,"North Rocky View Community Links (Community Links)","I was introduced to Community Links almost 10 years ago and am very grateful for their support and resources. We were fairly new to Airdrie and I was having difficulty raising three small children with a partner who had a drinking and gambling problem. The programs we accessed gave me new coping skills and my children a positive outlet during a very difficult time.The support I received from the staff and programs helped me to leave an abusive environment and make positive steps to ensure a safe, healthy home for my children. Becoming a single parent I joined the Single Parent Support Group which gave me the opportunity to connect with others experiencing the same day to day struggles and joys. Through Community Links, my children have been given the opportunity to experience drop-in PLAY groups, youth empowerment workshops and summer camps. These have been extremely beneficial, especially for my oldest son. I truly believe that his involvement in the summer camps set him on the right path to becoming the amazing young man he is today.Over the years, I have walked into the Community Links office overwhelmed with different circumstances in my life and the staff have helped me get focused and connected to whatever program, resource or other agency I needed (i.e. warm clothing, Mental Health support, housing, parenting). I remember one year, less than a week before Christmas, I walked through the doors having nothing. Within a few days, the staff put together a wonderful Christmas hamper for me and my children, which helped me in every way possible.The variety of programs and events they host makes a huge difference to so many people. Being connected to Community Links helps me in raising my children to become positive, productive members of this community and I dont know where I would be without them and their supporters. There are several times I could write about how extraordinary the staff at Community Links are and how much they have done for me and my family. I can honestly say that having Community Links as my go to support, I know I can face whatever challenges life brings my way and that I am not alone. Words cannot express my gratitude.

"196",707,"NorthernStar Mothers Milk Bank","Baby Sullivan was delivered 4 months early at 25 weeks and 5 days, by caesarean section,weighing just 1 lb, 7.5 ounces.Sullivan had multiple health factors associated with his very early delivery.His mom, Emily, also experienced complications during her pregnancy including preeclampsia and severe back pain. After delivery, what was thought to have been a slipped disc in Emilys back, was diagnosed as three large cancerous tumours.Unfortunately, with Emilys serious health complications and her starting chemotherapy treatments after Sullivan born, the decision was made to put Sullivan on pasteurized donor human milk from NorthernStar Mothers Milk Bank (formerly Calgary Mothers Milk Bank).With Emily and Sullivan each receiving treatmentsin different hospitals, Justin was unable to continue working. Emily was undergoing chemotherapy while Sullivan had multiple operations associated with his premature delivery. Sullivan relied on pasteurized donor human milk to provide not only nutrients, but also protection to his fragile immune and gastrointestinal systems. Due to Sullivans long-term hospital stay, he surpassed the age that the hospital would cover donor human milk, leaving his dad Justin to cover the cost.Justin reached out to NorthernStar Mothers Milk Bank and was accepted into the Charitable Care program to ensure Sullivan would continue to receive the life-saving donor milk his body needed free of charge.When Sullivan turned 10 months old, he lost his mom to cancer.Shortly after, Sullivan was able to leave the hospital and be at home with his dad. Because of his long term intubation, Sullivan built-upscar tissue in his esophagus causing it to narrow, making swallowing difficult. As a result most of his caloric intake was from pasteurized donor human milk through a tube in his stomach. He continued to receivedonor human milk until he was 18 months old._____________________________________________________________________________________We encourage you towatch the beautiful video on Baby Sullivan and learn more about our Charitable Care Program by visiting our website.","Every year in Alberta, 1 in 11 babies are born prematurely(less than 37 gestationalweeks).While the average term infant weighs approximately 7 and a half pounds, the smallest premature infants may weigh just over one pound. These babies are too small to breastfeed and areoften faced withhealth challenges. As advocates and champions for healthy babies, we believe, and science endorses, that human milk is the best option for any baby and that all babies should have access to life-saving donor human milk. We screen breastfeeding mothers as milk donors, accepting their excess milk as donations to be pasteurized in the laboratory, tested for bacteriaand dispensed to sick babies in hospitals and in the community.Research shows that when the mothers own milk is unavailable for the sick, hospitalized newborn, pasteurized donor human breast milk should be made available as an alternative feeding choice  (Canadian Pediatric Society; 2016). Pasteurized donor human milk provides the healthiest option to newborns and premature babies who spend time in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Many sick and fragile babies depend on the immediate access to donor human milk for its life-saving health benefits.For women who cannot nurse as a result of a low milk supply, necessary medication usage, illness, adoption or surrogacy, we make it possible for all at-risk Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) babies to receive human milk.The benefits of donor human milk:Lowers infection rates by transferring antibodies to fight diseaseDecreases length of stay in the NICUDecreases incidence of feeding intolerance and diarrheaDecreases the risk of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) - a potentially blinding eye disease that is primarily seen in premature babiesLowers the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) - the most fatal gastrointestinal infection in the NICUWho receives our milk? Predominantly hospitalized babies that:Were born prematureDo not have access to mothers own milk (adoption, surrogacy, mastectomy, breast reduction, illness)Do not have safe access to mothers milk (mother has infectious disease, illness, undergoing radiation or chemotherapy treatments)Have gastrointestinal and digestive issuesRequire donor human milk as part of post-operative careHave been diagnosed with a chronic illness or compromised immune systemAre a twin or multiple (low milk supply)Require donor human milk as a bridge until their mothers milk comes inNorthernStar Mothers Milk Bank is Canadas only community-based milk bank.There are currently two other milk banks, located in Vancouverand Toronto, however these milk banks are run out of provincially funded hospitals and almost exclusively servicebabies admitted within the hospitals they serve. As a community-based milk bank, we operate independently of the provincial health care system and can serve babies who wouldnt otherwise have access to donor human milk.Our Vision: to connect donor human milk with as many sick and fragile babies as possible.Our Beliefs:We are in the business of saving lives. We want to give every sick and fragile baby the best chance possible.Research supports that babies who receive donor human milk build critical immunity and are at a reduced risk of life-long illness. We should think of donor human milk the same way as we do medicine.Donor human milkcan help babies receive more nutrients, expedite healing and develop faster. It provides natural antibodies that help babies resist illnesses.We need a community-based solution for babies in need. Our agency screens breastfeeding women with excess milk who choose to donate for selfless reasons.Our commitment to safety is evident in our process. From our screening of donor mothers, to our state-of-the art lab, were committed to the highest safety standard in our field. See our video to learn more.Our Results:Since opening our doors in 2012, we have undergone substantial growth. Along with the statistics provided below, ten Milk Drops have also opened across Canada.20122013 2014 2015 2016  Number of Milk Donors217230 451650 812Number of Hospitals Served8 14 172022 Ounces of Milk Dispensed33,000 65,000 98,600133,956126,676","NorthernStar Mothers Milk Bank is leading the country in providing sick and fragile babies with life-saving breastmilk. In addition topasteurizing donor human milk, we also offer Breastfeeding classes, Lactation Consultant Advice andprovide a service to Bereaved mothers aiding in the healing process after a loss.We are in constant need of healthy breastfeeding mothers and help from community partnerships:Donor Moms: Milk donors are healthy women who have delivered a baby within the past year and who are currently breastfeeding or pumping their milk. They are not compensated for their milk and are donating selflessly. Our video How to Donate outlines how moms can begin the process of becoming donors. Click HERE for information on how to donate.Milk Drops: Outside of the Calgary area, Milk Drops are available as locations for approved donor moms to drop off their donations. These partnerships with health regions and doctors offices are essential as they increase community awareness for milk banking and make it easier for moms to donate.View a list of our Milk Drop locations HERE.Transfer of Milk: All of our donations are kept frozen until the pasteurization process. This requires timely transport using a variety of local and national couriers.Volunteers: We rely on volunteers to assist us in our day-to-day workings. Their time and effort allows us to keep our costs as low as possible and on track with the time sensitive production of pasteurized donor human milk.Pasteurized Donor Human Milk - How it works:Dispensing safe pasteurized donor human milk is our highest priority. We take numerous steps to ensure all babies receive safe human milk that retains the many benefits of human milk. NorthernStar Mothers Milk Bank adheres to the strict guidelines set forth by HMBANA (Human Milk Banking Association of North America). The pasteurization process can also be viewed in the video Milk Journey.Potential donor moms contact the milk bank and are guided through a verbal multistep screening, which includes lifestyle and medical history.Donor moms health care providers complete forms that verify a donor is healthy and that excess breast milk would be appropriate for donation.Donor moms have a blood test to screen for infectious diseases.Donor human milk is processed in our lab, where staff are required to scrub in prior to working with the milk. Donor human milk is poured into flasks, filtered, homogenized, poured into bottles, visually inspected and then heat sealed and labelled. The label allows each bottle of milk to be traced forwards or backwards through each step in the milk tracking system.Donor human milk is pasteurized using the Holder method of pasteurization. The milk is heated to 62.5 C for 30 minutes. This pasteurization process kills bacteria, CMV and other viruses while still preserving immunological properties unique to human milk. The macronutrients are unchanged by pasteurization.Third party testing of a sample of milk from each donor before pasteurization and a bottle from each batch post-pasteurization is sent to a third party lab to ensure there are no harmful bacteria. Milk is only dispensed once a post-pasteurization culture shows no growth.Milk is then stored in our industrial freezers at -20 C and is dispensed by prescription to hospitals or babies in the community.Our Programs:Breastfeeding Basics Classes: Monthly free prenatal breastfeeding class intended to give parents the tools to navigate the first few weeks with their newborn. Skills and strategies such as breastfeeding positions, proper latch, feeding frequency, when and where to get help, troubleshooting and common concerns, are all areas that our lactation consultant (IBCLC) will address.Lactation Consultant Services:Members of our staff are certified lactation consultants (IBCLC) who are readily available to answer any questions or concerns our donors have regarding breastfeeding their babies.Bereavement Donation Program:Some of our mothers who donate milk are going through a very difficult time as they were notable to bring their precious baby home with them. After a loss, milk production still continues and mothers have choices on how to manage their supply. Donating their breastmilk after the loss of their baby is an option that we provide. Donating milk often gives purpose to bereaved mothersknowing that their milk is helping other babies,andcreating alegacy for a lost child can be a step in the healing process.For more information on our programs, please contact us at 403-475-6455 or emailcontact@nothernstarmilkbank.ca.","We rely on the generosity of individuals and corporations in order to continue our life-saving program. Financial assistance as well as volunteers are an integral part of our success in helping sick and fragile babies.Financial SupportAs a non-profit organization, we do not receive any government funding. We operate on a cost recovery basis. Hospitals pay a dispensation fee which includes the cost of screening, pasteurizing and testing the milk. This does not include any costs incurred by our Charitable Care Program (see below), organization growth, equipment replacement, staffing needs outside of laboratory services, breastfeeding classes and materials, advertising and awareness campaigns. We must raise a minimum of $150,000annually to cover these additional operating costs.We havefive top priorities for funding:1. Charitable Care Program - $60,000Once babies leave the hospital, the cost of human donor milk is no longer covered by the hospital. Although the recipient might still be sick and still require donor human milk, the families are then left to cover the dispensing cost. In these cases, charitable care is available. This fund, which is generated solely from individual, family and corporate donors, ensures families have access to donor human milk for their baby. 100% of funds raised for charitable care are used to cover the cost of milk for families in need.2.   A NewPasteurizer - $40,000As the milk bank grows, so does the need for updated equipment. Our pasteurizer currently allows us to process143 bottles of donor human milk per day. A new pasteurizer would allow us to double our production and fulfill larger orders in less time.3. Ice maker - $5,000We currently receive daily deliveries of ice that is required for the pasteurization process. Having an ice machine on hand would help streamline the pasteurization process, make ice accessible and readily available and reduce transportation costs.4. Walk-in-Freezer - $70,000One of our largest challenges is storage. We are only able to pasteurize as much milk as our freezers will hold. Currently, we have milk stored at three different locations across Calgary that requires us to move, transfer and transport milk on a weekly basis. We will be installing a walk-in freezer in our new location that will permit us to have all of our donations and a larger amount of pasteurized milk on hand. 5. Transition to New Location - $200,000NorthernStar Mothers Milk Bank has seen a large amount of growth over the past four years. Our current facility limits the amount of milk that we are able to pasteurize and provide. We are expecting our growth to continue as the awareness of milk donation increases; therefore, in 2017 we will be transitioning to a new location. This will allow us to pasteurize a larger amount of milk, fulfill large orders, receive and dispense more milk and be prepared for emergency orders. The primary costs associated with this transition include: building a clean laboratory (plumbing and electrical fittings and installation), custom installation of a large walk-in freezer, moving costs, materials and furniture, as well as updating technology.Volunteer OpportunitiesWe are thankful for the generous donation of our volunteers time. Volunteers allow us to keep our milk costs as low as possible, as well as keep our day-to-day operations running smoothly. Our volunteers are involved in numerous activities, including:Pasteurization of donor milkLogging in donor milkAdministrative workWe also look for individuals who would be interested in joining our Ambassador Program. NorthernStar Ambassadors are our voice in the community. They are donor mothers, recipient mothers, nurses and volunteers who help us share our story in the community. They have first-hand experience and knowledge of the life-changing benefits of donating human donor milk.If you are interested in volunteering, please contact us at contact@nothernstarmilkbank.ca.","http://www.northernstarmilkbank.ca/","contact@northernstarmilkbank.ca","814033312RR0001","403.475.6455","Jannette Festival","650000","donor milk babi human",196,0.77055756117128,0.0124348174889691,0.0148415563578018,0.0172482952266346,0.00401123144805455,0.00401123144805455,0.0148415563578018,0.00521460088247092,0.0100280786201364,0.0100280786201364,0.0377055756117128,0.0473325310870437,0.00762133975130365,0.0304853590052146,0.0136381869233855

"198",478,"Old Trout Puppet Workshop","The Old Trout Puppet Workshop was founded back in the blustery winter of 1999 on a ranch in southern Alberta. We were a small gang of old buddies, with a fondness for beards and wood and wool and other old-fashioned and pleasant things; the world was uneasy with the threat of Y2K, and we felt an urge to huddle together for mutual protection, and to dedicate ourselves to something fragile, ridiculous, and gentle, out on the edge of the world. So we learned to carve puppets, and paid our rent through wholesome labour; we collected eggs, fed the pigs, cooked big stews, and premiered our first show to a bunkhouse full of cowboys and Hutterites.Since those distant and savage days, the Old Trouts have grown to become a semi-respected collective of artists: weve made puppet shows for both children and adults that tour the world, written and illustrated several books, crafted immense sculptures, taught eager young apprentices the secrets of their mystical art, and even made some award-winning films.We are first and foremost a collaborative enterprise, devoted to the advancement of puppetry as an art form that combines a variety of other art forms: acting, dance, sculpture, painting, music, and writing. Our passion springs from a core of founding members, who endeavour to develop a way of making art that is strengthened by the varied backgrounds and interests of its members; in turn, those varied backgrounds are shared, with a view to the long-term development of our collective understanding of the art of puppetry.We seek out new collaborations with each project, to discover new territories, and expand the artistic scope of those involved.Above all, we are dedicated to original creation: We interpret the world around us, the stories and histories and events that constitute our environment, and bring them into focus through the lens of our own idiosyncrasies and enthusiasms so that the end result is art that is immediate and unique.-----Where the name comes from:On the Palmer Ranch, where the Old Trouts first gathered, theres a swimming hole much beloved by the people of the area. In that swimming hole, it is said, there lives an ancient fish, who will answer any question you ask it, if you can swim deep enough to find it. Our company is named after that noble creature, even though truth be told we never did manage to find it. Old Trout is also a term of endearment in Newfoundland, and that gave the name an endearing ring; of course, when we named ourselves thusly we were not yet old, but every day we become more and more like our moniker.- See more atABOUT The Old Trouts","We promote and present puppet theatre, sculpture, and conventional theatre and to provide education in these areas.We facilitate collaborative production of puppet shows, sculpture, theatre and related art.We provide a facility that encourages varied and eclectic artistic endeavors.Calgarys Outstanding Artists for 2016: (March 16, 2016 - Calgary AB)                 The Mayors Lunch for Arts Champions, organized by Calgary Arts Development and the Office of the Mayor, was sold-out for the fourth year in a row.

"199",559,"Oldman Watershed Council","We are a stakeholder based organization. We represent everyone who lives, works, and plays in the Oldman watershed - a diverse land and water system, covering 23,000km in southwestern Alberta and 2100 km in Montana. Socially, we are also diverse. Urban and rural, Indigenous and new Canadian, technology and tradition: together, we make common decisions about our drinking water for the benefit of the economy, our environment, the prosperity of generations to come.Our citizens are hungry for unbiased, credible information, and we have established ourselves as an information hub for all stakeholders and communities. Under the provincial governments Water for Life Strategy, the OWC is one of 11 Watershed Planning and Advisory Councils in Alberta. We are mandated to provide advice, independent science, and big picture thinking to the Minister of Environment and Parks on the challenges that Alberta is currently facing. As such, we are an autonomous non-profit and we rely on the input, participation and financial support from engaged donors.Our keystone publication is the Integrated Watershed Management Plan, published in 2011, which sets out our 8 goals. It is a collaborative effort between sectors, stakeholders, First Nations and the public to create the watershed communitys plan. Since its publication, we have successfully tackled 2 of the 8 goals.The first was to improve the understanding and strengthen the commitment of residents to the health of the Oldman watershed. We now reach well over 15,000 people on a weekly basis through social media alone, and it also attracting donors. For example, our Oldman emblem made its first appearance in May 2015 as a gift from the City of Lethbridge on a billboard at the entrance to the city. It also features on 3 interactive display puzzle boards. Each element of the emblem tells a story that helps educate participants about where their water comes from, where it goes, and what happens in between. Significantly, we have embarked on an ambitious Film Project, which involves one core film and many shorter videos highlighting many specific watershed topics. A critical part of the project has been involving people in the project; bringing new partners into the OWC family, giving a voice to residents and demonstrating how to inspire a community into collective action. In June 2015, the film project trailer was completed and continues to be at the heart of our outreach work.The next goal we tackled was Goal 3 which is to manage and protect the integrity of headwaters and source waters. Based on the work of 2 behavior change specialists, 2 Outreach Assistants piloted our Engaging Recreationists Project in the summer of 2015. Its success attracted funding from the provincial government and others, so that we were able to continue with 4 Outreach Assistants, and a full-time Education Manager the following year. We have engaged representatives from various off-roading organizations and retailers to form a Recreation Advisory Committee. They ensure our programming is effective and help engage recreationists with our message about watershed health. This program also includes riparian restoration events, which attracts volunteers from all user groups.The third goal is: Identify water quality outcomes and assess factors impacting them for adaptive watershed management. This goal, and the remaining 5 goals will be tackled in turn as we move forward in time. Significantly, aspects of each goal will remain firmly entrenched within our ongoing operations.The Oldman Watershed Council exists to ensure clean, clear drinking water for generations to come. A healthy watershed is land-use practices that respect basic ecological thresholds - what happens on the land affects the water; andsafe water supply, habitat for wildlife and plants.The Rocky Mountains feed the headwaters of the Oldman mainstream and its tributaries (Crowsnest and Castle rivers, Willow and Pincher creeks), while the headwaters of the Belly, Waterton and St. Mary rivers rise in Montana. The watershed varies greatly, both in terms of the status of the land and water resources and impacts from human activities. In headwater sub-basins, water quantity is adequate, quality is fair to good, and riparian ecosystems are generally healthy. However, as the Oldman River flows east, water quality deteriorates, available water supplies diminish, and there are several issues of concern.Whether citizens are urban or rural, enjoy motorized or non-motorized recreation; whether new Canadians or indigenous - it will take everyone to make significant change. In a natural resource-based economy, the economy IS the environment. Our impact extends beyond southern Alberta to positively influence other watershed professionals across Canada, government at all levels, and citizens of every community. We are all downstream!","The Oldman Watershed Council is the only organization where individuals, companies, organizations and communities can come together to devise practical solutions to the challenges our watershed faces everyday. We believe that the best, long-lasting solutions come from the people who live, work and play here. Our vision is a healthy, resilient watershed where people, wildlife and habitat thrive. We maintain and improve the watershed by:Improving and sharing knowledgeBuilding and strengthening partnershipsPromoting and facilitating community and institutional action and stewardshipDeveloping and implementing integrated land and water plansOur current projects (2016-17) include making recommendations to the Government of Alberta, communications and outreach via a series of videos which are free for the public to use, growing The Hub (our multi-disciplinary office space, which we use to host free educational events with other green businesses and not-for-profits), providing technical expertise and funding for on the ground projects, instilling a stewardship ethic in backcountry users, and numerous community partnerships. As the OWC moves through its 8 Goals (arrived at through a multi-stakeholder consultation process), our current projects will grow and change.The OWC improves the watershed by sharing knowledge;building and strengthening stakeholder partnerships;developing integrated land and water plans; andfacilitating community and institutional action with independent research and projects.Eight Priority Goals for the PlanIn December 2011, the Oldman Watershed Council released Priorities for the Oldman Watershed: Promoting action to maintain and improve our watershed after consultation with the IWMP Core Team, watershed residents at 4 community information sessions and an on-line questionnaire. The priorities were endorsed by the Oldman Watershed Council Board of Directors and will be the guide for what issues the IWMP will address.8 priority GOALS (Oldman Integrated Watershed Management Plan) are:GOAL 1:Improve the understanding and strengthen the commitment of residents to the health of the Oldman watershed.GOAL 2:Optimize the availability of water for the natural ecosystem while supporting the social and economic needs of the community.GOAL 3:Manage and protect the integrity of headwaters and source waters.GOAL 4:Identify and prioritize thresholds to manage threats and impacts on terrestrial and aquatic habitat.GOAL 5:Understand groundwater and how it interacts with surface water.GOAL 6:Identify water quality outcomes and assess factors impacting them for adaptive watershed management.GOAL 7:Prevent and control invasive species.GOAL 8:Understand the status and implications of emerging contaminants.These are the goals that the IWMP will achieve over the next decade. Public and stakeholder engagement processes foster deeper understanding and commitment to the maintenance and improvement of watershed integrity, and determine concrete action strategies through the development of Action Plans. Action plans for each goal will include specific targets, actions, and recommendations to decision-makers to achieve desired outcomes.The Council consists of members who live or work within the Oldman Basin.These members provide leadership and guidance in watershed planning and management, water quality monitoring, and stewardship promotion. The OWC is governed by a Board of Directors who are comprised of fifteen representatives from various organizations and four members at large. The OWC was formed in September 2004, when the Oldman River Basin Water Quality Initiative (Initiative) merged with the Oldman Basin Advisory Council (BAC). When the ProvincesWater for Lifestrategy was released, these two groups combined to provide a diverse partnership knowledgeable in all areas of watershed management, including sustainable water management and land use practices in the Oldman Basin.Today, the Council provides leadership and guidance in watershed planning and management, monitoring water quality and promoting stewardship. The OWC has not only carried on the work of the Initiative and the BAC, but also acts as the Oldman Watershed Planning and Advisory Council as part of the Water for Life Strategy.The OWC is a voice for the watershed. We strive to ensure clean, clear, plentiful water for generations to come. That means making everyday changes in communities throughout Alberta today.","1. Communications and Outreach HighlightsThe OWC is into its second year of expanding staff to include a full-time Communications Specialist and the investment is paying off. We have grown our audience and attracted many new volunteers and donors by increasing our communications and by using more effective strategies.Our social media channels are powerful tools for us. We now easily reach at least 15,000 people every week. The strength of our social media means that related organizations depend on us.We have developed an extremely robust, interactive website which provides opportunities for education, information and collaboration. It has been recognized by experts in the field as an outstanding example of website design, and is updated on a continuous basis. It includes a blog to which guest contributors regularily submit.The new Oldman emblem is a versitile and powerful new branding tool. It forms the core of all our communications, including interactive displays, merchandise and instantly recognizable everywhere it is seen.Volunteers and interns help us achieve results. Reaching out to the community is part of implementing systemmic change and recruitment, training and retention has steadily increased.Our digital archive is complete and used by organizations across Canada. Photos are added on an ongoing basis and comprises a visual, historical record of the OWCs outreach work and helps us tell empowering stories about the people working hard to maintain and improve the watershed. They are free and thus accessed by many organizations, including government, for other communications work.Events bring people together and we have a continuous line-up of speaking engagements, regular meet-up groups, Lunch and Learns, and on the ground involvement in numerous community efforts to repair, restore and educate the public about where our water comes from, where it goes and their role in keeping it healthy.One of the most exciting communications and outreach projects that the OWC has embarked on is an ambitious film project. Not only are we producing a documentary, but we are also, at the same time, producing an number of spin-off videos about specific topics (such as municipal watershed managment or agriculture, just as examples). These videos are scripted in collaboration with community partners, who donate to the project and help tell the story of water use in the Oldman basin and beyond.2. Watershed Legacy ProgramSouthern Alberta is characterized by ranching, farming and some of the most pristine recreational areas in the world. This program provides landowners and watershed stewardship groups support to design, fund and execute projects that have a positive and tangible impact on our watershed.Past projects have included: off-stream watering sites, streambank stabilization, invasive weed removal, nutrient management, riparian fencing, wetland restoration, education and technical support.Holding the Reins is an annual event that welcomes nearly 200 participants from throughout the watershed and beyond to hear about the projects and to share these stories with the broader community. Students from Lethbridge College and their instructors are also active attendees.Applications are accepted once a year and selected on the basis of merit by a committee comprised of sector representatives with expertise in rural issues. Funding for this program comes from sponsors and donors who want to make a lasting contribution to the caretakers of the land who improve the integrity of our landscapes and foster awareness in present and future generations.3. Engaging Recreationists ProgramBy far the most diverse program, this project builds on the Headwaters Action Plan to include the development of an education and outreach program to address the cumulative effects threatening the headwaters. This involves supporting a stewardship ethic in motorized recreation users, and encouraging these users to adopt practices that reduce sediment in streams. 2015 was the pilot season for this project which began building relationships with off-highway vehicle users an backcountry campers on public land.The program is guided by the expertise of behaviour change specialists and utilizes effective, targeted programs and messaging, surveys and interviews.Riparian restoration events at selected sites in the watershed are a popular way of involving volunteers and experts from other organizations (such as: Cows and Fish, Trout Unlimited Canada, Spray Lake Saw Mills, Crowsnest Pass Quad Squad and others). Bridge decking and construction is a tangible way of both involving OHV users and making a clear statement protecting water quality for both habitat and uses downstream.The above groups, along with many others, have formed the Recreation Advisory Committee (RAC) which plays an important role in helping the OWC understand the perspectives of the stakeholder groups and thus affect more meaning, more immediate and more long-lasting change. They provide on the ground -- knowledge and expertise to ensure that education programs and government - led plans are effective at minimizing the impact of motorized recreation.In order to manage this program, including 4 seasonal Outreach Assistants and a cadre of volunteers, the OWC hired a full-time Education Program Manager in 2015.We continue to leverage the community, partner, and volunteer support and depend on the commitment from multiple stakeholder groups including represenatives from industry, governmnet, agriculture, recreation, NGOs and non-profit organizations. Significantly, this project depends on project funders who are committed to protecting our headwaters and ensuring water quality downstream.4. The HubThe OWC moved our office to downtown Lethbridge in Janurary 2016. We chose a space that maximizes opportunities to engage watershed residents and build partnerships - the Hub for environment information and action.Since then, we have hosted many events, also in conjunction with Environment Lethbridge, who rents space from us. The large community space at the heart of our premises is offered for free for educational events and we are looking forward to developing stronger relationships with the community to truly make the space a hub for activity underscoring watershed health.Donors and sponsors are welcome to support either one off events or, for example, a series of Lunch and Learns.5. Committees and Community PartnershipsThe OWC works with many committees, boards, and affiliated groups on common goals. Some of these include: Agriums Caring for our Watersheds Program which engages grade 7-12 students; Taber Irrigation District Integrated Watershed Management Project which constructs wetlands, riparian enhancements and canal improvements; City of Lethbridge Environment and Historic Resources Strategy Community Liason Group - dealing with the relationship between development and the environment; Porcupine Hills Coalition providing recommendations related to the linear footprint Management Plan and the Recreation Management Plans coming out of the South Saskatchewan Regional Plan; Lethbridge Chamber of Commerce Natural Resources and Environment Committee - highlighting the connection between food and water and overall watershed health; Round Table on Crown of the Continent - collaboration on projects and multi-organizational events to promote conservations and stewardship activities in the crown; Watershed Planning and Advisory Councils of Alberta - we meet regularily to learn from each other share resources, explore sustainable funding sources and maintain a strong provincial voice with the Government of Alberta; South Saskatchewan Intra-Basin Water Coordination Committee - provides advise to the Government of Alberta on managing water and how best to share water between the prairie provinces; Watershed Resiliency and Restoration Program - provides advise and recommendations to the GOA in alignment with the capital Agriculture Watershed Enhancement Program; Alberta Water Council - providing input to project teams on a wide range of topics; Kainai Ecological Protection Agency - offering support, advise and participation in events.These are just some of the committees and community partnerships the OWC is actively involved in. Funding for this important and ongoing work is critical in order to ensure that water remains always top of mind.","The OWC is a volunteer-driven, not-for-profit organization that offers many opportunities for involvement.

"200",682,"Oneball Charitable Cancer Organization","When I was 18, I was an average kid working at Swiss Chalet for the summer. Life was good, until one day... disaster. I tripped off an elliptical machine and canned myself. Nice. Over, the next few weeks, I noticed some swelling in my gentlemans area and thought that I kind of deserved it, so I ended up ignoring and making excuse after excuse for not doing anything. Eventually I decided to talk to my mother about my balls (super awkward) and she insisted I see a doctor. What they ended up finding was cancer. Getting canned saved my life but I was terrified.This marked the beginning of my nine and half year journey with testicular cancer.What I didnt know at the time was that testicular was the #1 cancer for men aged 15-35, and is often referred to as the young mans cancer. In every cancer seminar I went to, I was always the youngest patient by 30 or 40 years. I felt alone. In this isolation I struggled with thoughts like will any woman ever love me, will I ever have kids, am I going to survive this. I was diagnosed a second time four and a half years later at age 23, and the feelings of isolation and fear of these questions only got worse. For 7 years, I told almost no one about my cancer. I didnt want to be judged or pitied, or be seen as that cancer boy.Sadly this path of isolation is one that many men go down, but thats where Oneball steps in.Oneball is, in a word, ballsy. We use humor and fun events to help men open up - but were not just fun and games. We fund life changing research, we help pay the over $6,000 of medications not covered by our health care, and we provide critical information in a relatable way  like talking to a friend.So why does this appraoch work? Well, if you ask any woman, they will tell you that men are bad at, at least two things: 1) asking for help and 2) taking care of themselves. Why? Because of things like pride or awkwardness and this is part of why men are 50% more likely to die from cancer than women. By using this playful approach, we shatter the stigma so that men can feel comfortable reaching out to an organization that understands them, and avoiding the feelings of isolation and fear that this disease can bring.Since being declared cancer free in January 2016, Chriss personal motto is that it takes precisely zero balls to make a difference. Making a difference doesnt require a tremendous amount of courage, or the physical presence of balls he says making a difference is a choice.","Testicular cancer can stike without notice, and is the #1 cancer for men aged 15-35.Founded In 2009, Oneball is a volunteer run organization consisting of testicular cancer survivors, stand-up friends, family members, and everyday people, all with the common goal of giving testicular cancer a kick in the groin! Oneball is, in a word, ballsy. We use humor and fun events to help men open up, but were not just fun and games. We provide critical information in a relatable way  like talking to a friend.OUR RESULTS:Since Oneballs founding in 2009, we have raised over $200,000 to help give testicular cancer a kick in the groin!We have funded life changing research that has been published in the Journal of Clinical oncology which has the potential to transform how doctors handle their patients follow up. The study showed that CT Scans might not be needed after two years, resulting in far less exposure to radiation for patients, and peace of mind up to three years earlier.New to 2017, the Balls Out Bailout, Oneballs Patient Financial Assistance Program, has already begun to help fund its first few patients (more details to follow). This program aims tohelp patients pay the over $6,000 of medicationsnot covered by our health care in addition to day to day expenses like groceries and rent.Balls on the ground: Through our Student Chapters at the University of Calgary and Mount Royal University, we have now held a number events around each of the campuses that have now attracted hundreds participants and spectators, and more than a few cringeworthy ball jokes as well.","Oneball provides services in three areas:Awareness, Research, and Patient Assistance.At Oneball, we believe that cancer is a journey, and aim to make sure we can help every step of the way. Additionally, we also believe that cancer is not just a disease, but a community - be it the caregivers around a patient, or the other incredible organizations in this sector, we need to make sure were working with all of them.AWARENESSWith testicular cancer being a very curable disease (98% stage 1 and 96% stage 2), awareness is critical in making sure young men know what they can do to make sure theyre balls are safe. To accomplish this, we have established two student chapters - one at the University of Calgary, and one at Mount Royal University. Our work through these student chapters ensures that were delivering the experiences (like dodgeball!) that excite this demographic and will better guide them to learning more about this disease.RESEARCHEven though we are a cancer charity, we realized something pretty startling: we are not trying to cure cancer. With such a high survival rate for testicular cancer, we feel as though our donation dollars are better spent on other areas of the testicular cancer journey such as improvements in treatment and follow up, developing a better understanding of the mental and emotion hardships of the disease, and more. In 2016 a Oneball funded research paper was published in the prestigious Journal of Clinical Oncology which found that CT scans are no longer needed for testicular cancer patients two years after undergoing chemo-therapy. This means 3 years less exposure to radiation from the CT Scans (which can themselves cause cancer) and getting peace of mind for patients and their families 3 years earlier. This an example of how the research we fund can improve the lives of patients everywhere.PATIENT ASSISTANCENew to Oneball in 2017 is the introduction of our Oneball Patient Financial Assistance program, or as we like to call it, our Balls out Bail Out. What if I told you that on top of all the physical and emotional challenges associated with testicular cancer, a patient might also have to suffer crippling financial challenges as well? Right now,a patient undergoing chemotherapy and radiation can be forced to pay over $6,000 for medications not covered by our health care system.In addition to these medications, the surgeries associated with testicular cancer can put a patient out of work for some time. Its hard enough for most people to pay for basic amenities on a low income, imagine how hard it is if youre a young man whos just starting out on his own and has to pay thousands of dollars for life-saving medications. Talk about kicking someone while hes down! With this in mind, Oneball, in a coordinated effort with Wellspring Calgary, are offering financial assistance to testicular cancer patients who are in dire straits by helping them pay for vital medications as well as other expenses.","So what can you do to help get the ball rolling?

"201",837,"Operation Eyesight","Giving up isnt an option. Our patients dont give up, so neither do we. Were here for high needs patients who need our help ― like 10-year-old Simon. When I lost my right eye, I kept going. But when the other eye became infected I thought I would go blind! I thought my family would reject me like I was a cursed child, says young Simon from Kenya.Simon injured his right eye as a young child and lost his vision in that eye. But when he contracted trachoma in his left eye ― a blinding and excruciating infectious eye disease ― his world turned dark and bleak. My dreams were shattered and my parents couldnt help me anymore, said Simon.From a young age, Simon told his parents that his dream job was to become a tour guide like the ones that drove him home on their way to the Maasai Mara ― a large game reserve in Narok County, Kenya. His determination never faltered as he worked toward his goal.But his dreams were threatened as the trachoma increasingly turned worse and his eyelashes scraped his eyeball causing excruciating pain. His parents tried every traditional medicine available to them, including a folk remedy of putting tobacco in his eye to cure it. Nothing helped and his father took him to help care for the livestock.Fortunately for Simon, Operation Eyesights kind-hearted donors understand the needs of so many people in poverty-stricken countries. Its through the support from people in Canada, that Simon received sight-restoring surgery to save his left eye.Back in school after his surgery, Simons teacher is impressed with how well hes doing. Hes so eager to catch up with the rest of the class that he sometimes forgets he only has one eye. Im so happy with his progress, says his teacher.Since his surgery, Simons dream has changed and he wants to become a doctor to help save others. Now that Im back in school, I want to become a doctor so I can help my family like the doctors helped me.Simon didnt give up and instead shows us what courage is and how much work we still have to do. And thanks to our wonderful donors were making strides.Our motto is to provide the best for the poorest, and weve been doing that since our founding in 1963 by Calgary businessman Arthur (Art) Jenkyns. After meeting physician Dr. Ben Gullison who worked at a mission hospital in Sompeta, India, Art knew he had to help those in need, and founded Operation Eyesight in Calgary.What followed was a partnership between Albertans and Indian eye doctors to train local professionals with the skills they needed to bring quality eye care to their communities.Throughout the 1960s, success was measured through quantity, and Operation Eyesight was funding screening eye camps, training and cataract surgeries with a goal of reducing the backlog of patients needing surgeries. By the early 1980s, we were funding prevention programs focused on dealing with the root causes of blindness in addition to blinding eye conditions.But research in the late 1990s showed that trying to perform as many cataract surgeries as possible resulted in high surgical failure rates. Worse, our focus on cataract surgeries meant wed neglected blinding eye diseases like glaucoma and trachoma.Today we invest in sustainable treatment, prevention and community development working with a variety of partners including country health ministries, partner hospitals, other non-governmental organizations and community leaders.","Operation Eyesight is a Calgary, Canada-based international development organization dedicated to eliminating avoidable blindness in Africa and Asia. In developing countries, blindness can be a death sentence. Without sight, people are robbed of their ability to provide for themselves and their family.Sadly, 80 percent of blindness is avoidable, and for millions of people in developing countries, blindness is a reality due to poverty, lack of eye health awareness and education and lack of access to eye health services. Conditions like cataract and the need for eyeglasses affect 189 million people worldwide, and 89 percent of those people live in low and middle-income countries.Our philosophy is the best for the poorest, and we treat everyone in the countries where we work regardless of age, gender, race, caste, religion or ability to pay. We help people like Thomas in Kenya. Thomas worsening vision forced him to give up his thriving tailoring business and was threatening his livelihood. Read his story here.Our goal is to eliminate avoidable blindness, and to do that weve embedded seven of the 17 United Nations-developed Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in our operational work which include:No PovertyGood Health and Well-BeingQuality EducationGender EqualityClean Water and SanitationReduced InequalitiesPartnerships for the GoalsWhen people can see, they can work and go to school. By preventing blindness and restoring sight, we break the cycle of poverty by helping entire families escape impoverishment.OUR RESULTS:Last year we screened 3.4 million patients through hospitals, community outreach programs and school screenings, effectively reaching people at the community level.To date weve:established 107 vision centres in India, of which 93 percent are financially self-sustainable.declared 400 villages avoidable blindness-freeworking with more than 143 hospital partners across the countries we work, weve trained 15,300 community health workers since 2006, and drilled 48 wells in areas needing a new water supply.","We believe in providing people in high need communities with the same eye care we receive here in Canada. Our Hospital-Based Community Eye Health Program incorporates eye health care into the countrys primary health care. This helps ensure that communities have access to eye care services. We believe in empowering whole communities to take responsibility and ownership of their eye health, ensuring our programs are sustainable and continue long after funding has ended.PREVENTION:The most effective way to save sight. Through awareness, education, screening, vitamin supplementation and more, we prevent sight loss before it begins.EYEGLASSES:A simple eye exam and a pair of new, prescription eyeglasses can restore sight. The sale of eyeglasses to customers able to pay helps provide eyeglasses to those who cant afford them.HOSPITALS: By supporting our hospital partners, we help them become more productive and financially self-sustainable. Through our innovative Hospital-Based Community Eye Health projects, were eliminating avoidable blindness in many regions.EYE SURGERY: Cataracts can be treated with eye surgery, yet they remain the most common eye problem in the world. We provide access to quality, affordable surgeries so that more people can have their sight restored.CLEAN WATER: Poor sanitation allows diseases like sight-stealing trachoma to spread rapidly. Through the provision of clean water, were saving sight in countries like Zambia and Kenya.COMMUNITIES:Much of our work begins in the community, where we train local eye health workers to diagnose and treat simple eye problems. More complex cases are referred to one of our hospital partners.Partnerships: We create in-depth partnerships that include local government departments, community organizations and leaders, and other non-governmental organizations. Through our model, we help build the capabilities of our partner hospitals ─ from renovating existing structures to providing eye care training. Building our partners capabilities to deliver quality eye care services allows eye care professionals to educate communities on the importance of proper eye health.Community Health Workers: At the outset of any program, we target specific community needs. We conduct detailed assessments of our partner hospital service deliveries, infrastructure and staffing. Using strict criteria, we define target areas and then train community health workers (CHWs). Living and working in the community they serve, community health workers are a crucial component of our model. These trained workers conduct door-to-door screening, refer patients needing additional treatment and provide transportation where necessary. Weve found this to be the most efficient way of reaching high-need communities, raising awareness and breaking down barriers to eye health care.Women make up 80 percent of our community health workers, and their active involvement also helps promote womens health and gender equality. Promoting gender equality and empowering women is important, yet many women face barriers to working. Shabnam is one community health worker who fought hard to work, but once she did shes been making significant contributions. Read her story here.Each area where we work includes a base secondary hospital that diagnoses and treats patients for various eye health problems. We establish primary eye care vision centres in the target communities in the hospitals service area. Vision centres are embedded in communities to give them access to primary eye health services.Under our model, every project is sustainable use proven sustainability practices. We train existing hosital staff and all recurring expenses are absorbed by the hospitals. We also implement cost-recovery practices, meaning that funding for those who cant afford to pay comes from revenue earned from those who can afford to pay.We reach a wide range of people, some in remote areas, and our strength comes from partnerships. By encouraging community participation, and supporting our partner hospitals, our projects last long after funding has ended.","Take action! Get involved helping people who cant help themselves. Its a global effort for human rights and justice and were in this together. The Sustainable Development Goals are critical in providing the people where we work with the dignity, independence and freedom to work, live and play like we can do at home.There are many ways to help from donating, to leaving a gift in your will, gifting on behalf of a loved one, and volunteering your time. Blindness is a worldwide health crisis robbing millions of people of hope, and even their lives.

"202",101,"PALS Pet Access League Society","I was a long-term care patient at The Fanning Centre and could not walk. PALS would visit the main seating area, and I could hear that there were animals (dogs), and I wanted to visit, but no staff was available to help me out of bed into a wheelchair. I taught myself to transfer to a wheelchair from a hospital bed, and looked forward to the visits. This motivated me to learn to use a walker and I checked out of The Fanning Centre and adopted a dog. This lovely miracle of a dog helped me learn to walk again, and I vowed to give back to PALS if I could. Also, my Father was one of the first volunteers when the organization started. [PALS Volunteer]This story demonstrates the power of pet therapy.Medical studies prove that pets improve the emotional and physical well-being of humans. Its astonishing what contact with animals can do for a persons emotional and physical health. Simply watching a pet can actually lower stress levels and blood pressure. Such fascinating facts are the basis for PALS.","Since its inception in 1985, the Pet Access League Society (PALS) has worked with volunteers and their pets to bring the amazing benefit of the animal-human bond to those who are unable to access it on their own. This includes Calgarians residing for long and short terms stays at hospitals, nursing homes, mental health facilities, homeless shelters, and young offenders centres. It also includes children in special schools and programs through the Calgary Public Library.Because many children and teens enjoy working with animals, animal assisted therapy can be particularly beneficial for those who are resistant to treatment or have difficulty accessing their emotions or expressing themselves in talk therapy. Animals have also been known to reach non-responsive individuals when conventional therapy has been unsuccessful. Animal assisted therapy has been particularly beneficial for those with autism, addictions, Alzheimers, psychiatric conditions and strokes and brain injuries.PALS Vision: Enhanced quality of life through pet visitation therapy.PALS Mission: Enhance the lives of Calgarians, through the known human-animal bond, with pet visitation therapy, program development, research, education, and collaboration.PALS Values:Provide safe and enjoyable pet visitation programs to the Calgary communityInitiate and participate in new programs involving human animal bond in response to our communitys needsSupport pet therapy advancement through program development, research, education, and collaborationProvide quality leadership, support, and growth to our volunteers and staffEnsure all program participants, volunteers, staff, and animals are treated with dignity, respect, compassion, and understanding","All PALS programs are provided free to the clients and facilities we serve. Currently we have three main programs: Pet Visitation Therapy Program, Story PALS and our newest program, Puppy Rooms. The Pet Visitation Therapy Program provides visits to most of the facilities mentioned above. The recipients of this program are primarily persons whose response to other forms of therapy is non-existent, or to whom pet therapy would provide an alternative to other more common forms of therapy. Clients who benefit from this program have often experienced brain injuries or strokes, Alzheimers or other forms of dementia, Autism or Aspergers or are in palliative care.Story PALS is collaboration with the Calgary Public Libraries where we bring dogs into select libraries for children who are having issues with reading and these children spend some one on one time with the dogs reading to them. It has proven to strengthen the childrens reading ability and increase their confidence levels significantly.Our newest program is working with the Calgarys universities and other post-secondary institutes by providing some stress release activities during exam times. This program is extremely popular with the students and this year we are already booked into the U of C, Bow Valley College, and St Marys University College and we are talking with SAIT and Mount Royal.PALS clients are 75% senior citizens, 5% adults, and 20% children and teenagers. The need for our services continues to grow, in part due to the measurable benefits of pet therapy, but largely due to the increase in an ageing population. As the population ages and continues to move from independent housing toward some type of long term care facility the residents often are forced to downsize their personal belonging and that includes the family pet. Despite statistical facts surrounding improved mental and physical health and wellbeing with exposure to pets, at the time in their life when pets become the most important the connection is removed. PALS visits on a regular basis helps to bridge that connection again, helping to restore what was once lost.Volunteers have always been the backbone of PALS and currently there are over 450 volunteers that assist with keeping PALS up and running. This includes approximately 275 who visit with their four-legged pals (who include dogs, cats and guinea pigs). These volunteers form 75 teams and on a pre-set schedule visit nearly 50 facilities including hospitals, nursing homes, a correctional centre, day programs, group homes, and other care facilities. Visits are up to one and a half hours long and can include both group visits and one-on-one visits.PALS is currently funded completely by private and corporate donations and by numerous fundraising events held throughout the year.","PALS Pet Access League Society has many ways for you to become involved depending on what you are looking for. We are always looking for dedicated, community-minded individuals to help PALS enhance the lives of Calgarians who can benefit from Pet Therapy.Donate: PALS relies on charitable contributions to continue and expand our programming to meet our mission of enhancing the lives of those who benefit of pet therapy. We are always grateful for donations of any kind including: monetary, programming supplies, office equipment and supplies.Volunteer: PALS would not exist without the support of its volunteer base. We welcome their expertise in all areas of programming and operations (see link at the beginning).Volunteer opportunities include:a) PALS program volunteers: become part of the Pet Therapy Visitation Program and join over 275 volunteers and their pets who visit in over 50 facilities throughout the city; orb) events volunteers: each year PALS hosts a number of fundraising and awareness raising events throughout the city. Volunteers, with and without their pets are always needed.Host an event: PALS welcomes groups from the community who are interested in hosting an event and donating the proceeds to our programming. Families, community groups, corporations, businesses have hosted sporting events, wine tasting, photo contests, etc to raise money for PALS.","http://www.palspets.com","diana@palspets.com","107811879RR0001","403.250.7257","Diana Segboer","145500","anim volunt dog adopt",202,0.0312213039485767,0.303948576675849,0.014692378328742,0.0257116620752984,0.0532598714416896,0.0257116620752984,0.0477502295684114,0.0339761248852158,0.157943067033976,0.0202020202020202,0.130394857667585,0.0229568411386593,0.0174471992653811,0.061524334251607,0.0532598714416896

"204",648,"Potential Place Society","Hello, my name is Izzy. Im a member of Potential Place, and Im here to tell you about my journey and to open a door of hope to young adults who struggle with mental illness. Mental illness is real. Instead of making mental illness a dark shadow, and having stigma attached to it - and all the fear that it creates in people to not reach out for help - we can create light and hope for people who are suffering. If we educate and create mental health awareness, people will no longer have to face mental illness in the dark or alone, scared and isolated.Im currently 25 years old, I was adopted as a young child, I was born in Poland, and when polish social services apprehended me, I was found in deplorable conditions taken to an orphanage where I was adopted. I had suffered neglect and abuse in my early child hood years, which was damaging to my health development both physically and psychologically. I had inadequate nutrition for my brain development as well as inadequate caregiving for my emotional development.My adoptive parents who were supposed to love me and protect me from harm, repeatedly abused me physically, sexually and emotionally - abused me for years up until I got to my later teen years. I ran away from home, ended up on the streets, homeless, living in shelters, and having to survive, I got into prostitution. I attempted suicide in grade 10.I recently went through an extensive psychological assessment which resulted in diagnoses of PTSD, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, major depressive disorder, intellectual disability, learning disabilities, along with features of avoidant and dependent personality disorder. I also learned that my biological moms alcoholism left me suffered with brain damage, and now going through the process of an FASD assessment.When I first became aware of Potential Place I found it overwhelming; however, I continued attending despite the level of anxiety I felt. I needed people that understood what I was going through during this stage of my life, so I came up with an idea to start a young adult program so young adults can have a place where they connect with people their age, and get support building their goals and skills while steering them with the right resources and to help manage their mental health without judgement and shame. Young adults need support for their wellness - so they can engage themselves by going to school, or maintaining a job in the community to create meaning in their lives. They need to have a support network - so they can have the confidence to face their challenges and barriers - and so they can become independent and know that their voice matters, and its ok to speak up and to reach out for help. Everyone needs that chance in life to have the opportunity to succeed, to grow and discover who they are as person and not just a diagnosis or a label.Potential Place is a unique community and a place that has been my key support and I cannot imagine where I would be in life without Potential Place. It has been a place where I can work towards my educational goals, build relationships and feel part of something bigger then myself. Feeling like I am part of a community where people understand my strengths and weaknesses does make a big difference in my life. I dont have family support and a part of me will feel empty but I now see that family can be the people like the community of Potential Place, and the community of school, and friends and other supports I choose to have around me. I sometimes I feel vulnerable and scared to show my emotions but Potential Place hasnt judged me and I dont feel ashamed during my hardest times. I am accepted for who I am on my good and bad days. Potential Place community has been there for me when no one else has been there for me.","In a world of misunderstanding, Potential Place is a safe place that offers recovery through acceptance and opportunities to work side-by-side with professional staff in a structured work-ordered-day, one that is pre-vocational and which often-times, offers members opportunities for transitional, supported and independent employment in the community. Since 1995, Potential Place has been dedicated to building a community that cares for individuals suffering from mental illness. Potential Place is a voluntary, caring community that offers a place of hope, dignity and growth. Like most Clubhouses world-wide, Potential Place is defined by values of acceptance, empowerment and egalitarianism.Our Vision: Supporting recovery from mental illness in a community that Guarantees:A place to comeMeaningful workMeaningful relationshipsA place to return","The work-ordered day engages members and staff together, side-by-side, in the running of Potential Place.We focus on strengths, talents and abilities; therefore, the work-ordered day does not include medication clinics, day treatment or therapy programs.The work done at Potential Place is exclusively the work generated by Potential Place in the operation and enhancement of the community. No work for outside individuals or agencies, whether for pay or not, is acceptable work at Potential Place. Members are not paid, nor are there any artificial reward systems.Potential Place is open five days a week and parallels typical working hours.Potential Place is organized into one or more work units, each of which has sufficient staff, members and meaningful work to sustain a full and engaging work-ordered day. Unit meetings are held to foster relationships as well as to organize and plan the work of the day.All work at Potential Place is designed to help members regain self-worth, purpose and confidence; it is not intended to be job specific training.Members have the opportunity to participate in all the work, including administration, research, enrollment and orientation, reach out, hiring, training and evaluation of staff, public relations, advocacy and evaluation of Potential Places effectiveness.Transitional Employment Program (TEP):Transitional Employment provides members with part-time, entry-level employment opportunities and the ongoing support they may need to stay on the job. We feel that Transitional Employment is not just about the tasks of the job, but also about maintaining a working ethic. We also provide assistance for Supported or Independent Employment opportunities, as we believe that this also provides members the self-confidence to eventually obtain permanent employment.We have developed TE program-specific marketing materials. We have developed a Gantt chart to track activities by time line and have reflected colleague hours actually worked in each activity area. We have developed a member booklet that dedicates approximately 20 percent of its content to Employment. The ED, the employment coordinator and clubhouse members on the Board of Directors have engaged the Board to assist with TEP referrals. We have a system in place to train members and staff to do TE development and we have formalized procedures with respect to database management and cold call recording and methods for approaching prospective employers. Members and staff have been involved in the training process.It is a new experience working with new people and developing new skills. It makes me feel like I contribute to a company and the community during the Calgary flood situationGlenYoung Adults Program (YAOP):The YAOP (Young Adult of Potential Place) program is a new and exciting initiative for Young Adults. This opportunity provides a peer to peer engagement between young adults who are transitioning from youth into adult programming. Work-Ordered-day responsibilities and social recreation activities are more age-appropriate.We want Young Adults to participate in each unit where they feel like they can learn, and gain new experiences.Mental illness usually first occurs in young adults. With appropriate resources and connections their mental illness can be managed in healthy ways.A focus on all Young Adults will help build their goals, skills and empower them to discover their talents, in many areas including;EducationEmploymentWellness and RecoverySocial RecreationIndependenceSelf AdvocacyWe believe Young Adults are highly energetic people who have much to offer our community. They are creative and artistic too!Education:Recognizing that supported education and employment are inseparable components along the career continuum, The member benefits because Potential Place attempts to help members develop the skills and confidence needed to succeed in accomplishing their goals within Calgarys educational community. Peers help tutor members in areas of Math, English and Computers. Potential students are also offered some mentoring and administrative guidance when required.Many people affected by a mental illness are interested in work but may not have the educational background or self-confidence to pursue their employment goals immediately. Many have had disrupted educational opportunities during their formative years. These member benefits can be vital to their ability to acquire work beyond many entry-level positions.Social Recreation:At Potential Place, social recreation is an integral part of reintegration into the larger Calgary Community and it is a very important aspect in all Clubhouses. It contributes to the wellness of all colleagues. All activities are based on members wants and needs. Examples of some activities held within the Clubhouse are social Coffee Houses, Karaoke Nights, Dances, film nights, arts and crafts and game nights. Activities held outside Potential Place include walks for coffee, evening/day trips, picnics etc.Social recreation activities begin, build and strengthen relationships at Potential Place. All Social time is planned for after work-ordered day hours. As most of our members are on low incomes, most outings that have a cost to them are shared between members and Potential Place.Social recreation is offered on Fridays between 4:00 pm and 8:30 pm, as well as the first Saturday of every month from 11:00 am to 4:00 pmWellness:To keep the body in good health is a duty, otherwise we shall not be able to keep our mind strong and clear. ~BuddhaPoor preventive health care has created an epidemic among those with a mental illness. This trend results in a decrease in life expectancy of up to 20 years compared to the national average. Our wellness initiative at Potential Place is commitment to deal with these chronic issues.Potential Place is committed to providing members the opportunity to address issues impacting their overall health. We have begun an initiative that focuses on assisting members with making healthier lifestyle choices that promote:Healthy eating strategies,Healthy exercise strategies,Decreasing overall weight.Our Bistro has decided to make healthier menu choices such as baked goods and nutritious meals vs. chocolate bars, water and juices vs. soft drinks and well-proportioned meals for $3. We have well-priced coffee and bottled water. Our members are directly involved in menu creation, running and managing the kitchen as well as the Bistro.Each morning we start the day with stretching (ie: Yoga  Tai-Chi). We have a wellness lunch twice a month to educate members on healthy eating and nutrition. Also, every Friday evening we get together and do something fun (Bowling, Billiards, and Movies etc) for our social wellness. Mental and physical health is fundamentally linked, so its important to pay attention to both!","In 2014, a Social Return on Investment study was done by Success Markets Inc., and Charity Intelligence indicating an SROI of 7:1. According to the findings of this study, roughly 372 Alberta residents with mental illness would struggle to find or maintain employment, a sense of community and personal wellbeing each year without the intervention of Potential Place.Their physical and mental health would suffer as a result, and the Alberta government would incur significant extra costs. This preliminary estimate was produced using conservative assumptions and shows that an average beneficiary of Potential Place appears to receive a best estimate of approximately $24,000 in lifetime benefits from things like employment, housing and decreased long-term medical expenses at a cost of around $7,000 per client. At the same time, greater society appears to save roughly an additional $24,000 per beneficiary in cost avoidance of public assistance, homelessness, and healthcare expenses.Here are some ways you can be part of Potential Place and experience Clubhouse magic:DONATE:Join ourBenefactors Circlewith a donation of$100,000or more and you will receive:A Potential Place Program will bear your nameA Potential Place Gold Key, framed for you to proudly hang in your officesParticipation in a newsworthy victory awards presentationA plaque at Potential Place recognizing your roleOur monthly newsletterA charitable tax receipt for the full value of your contributionFor participation of$50,000or more, you will be recognized as aPotential Place Patronwith:A Potential Place Gold Key, framed for you to proudly hang in your officesParticipation in a newsworthy victory awards presentationA plaque at Potential Place recognizing your roleOur monthly newsletterA charitable receipt for the full value of your contributionFriends of Potential Place,pledging$5,000or more receive:A position on a plaque at Potential Placee commemorating the role you played in establishing Potential Place.Participation in a newsworthy victory awards presentationOur monthly newsletterA charitable tax receipt for the full value of your contributionHost a 3rd Party fundraising event: We are always looking for new ways to fundraise.

We will set up an opportunity to review this with you.How It Works:Our commitment begins with a consultation to make sure that the job is suitable for our membership. This includes sending one of our staff to your work site to learn the job and ensure that our members can perform the duties consistently and accurately.Potential Place members are then trained on the job, by us, until they are ready to perform their work independently, productively, and to your company standards. Maintaining contact with you in order to monitor job progress, our staff will gradually withdraw from the work site as the members become confident and proficient at their job duties.Members are paid directly by you at the prevailing hourly rate for the job; Potential Place does not receive a commission or referral fee. Should a member be absent for any reason whatsoever, a staff member will cover the job at no cost to you. In the event that the job match is not suitable, we will also provide coverage until a replacement has been recruited and trained.A member will perform the job you providefor up to nine months. Once they have completed their placement, that member will leave to pursue other opportunities. We will then recruit and train a new member to replace them.The continuum of employment opportunities we offer at Potential Place is considered our most important activity. It builds the ties of support between our members and the community through which personal strength and self-confidence are nurtured.","http://potentialplace.org","frank.kelton@potentialplace.org","895282358RR0001","403.216.9249","Frank Kelton","1141554","hous client senior care",204,0.0208333333333333,0.0225225225225225,0.0140765765765766,0.230292792792793,0.0157657657657658,0.0343468468468468,0.0411036036036036,0.0275900900900901,0.284346846846847,0.0647522522522523,0.0461711711711712,0.071509009009009,0.0275900900900901,0.0411036036036036,0.0579954954954955
"205",286,"Project Ploughshares (Canadian Council of Churches)","The year was 1991. Operation Desert Storm was the name of the invasion. Such value-laden yet ambiguous names these wars were givenOperation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Liberate Kuwait, Operation Friction (the Canadian name for Desert Storm). Names that might lead young men and women to think they were fighting for something good and purethe just war theory come to life.My nephew from Ohio was there in Iraq  a proud marine fighting for truth, justice and the American way. He was just 20, with a young wife and two little girls at home. Too young to be fighting wars. I remember watching the news night after night - wanting to see my nephew, to reach out to him through the screen. It was filled with video game images of a war being waged right before my eyes, against an entire nation of peoplepeople like you and me.people who loved their children and just wanted the best for them. This was a war that, seen on the television screen, looked impersonal, far-away, giving a fireworks-like impression that could make the viewer forget that there were real people being killed and wounded every day. I was often in tears, sitting cross-legged in front of the screen after I had put my babies to bed, not wanting them to see my grief and absolute rage at what was happening.I developed a deep political sensibility during the Vietnam era. I was a senior in high school when four students were shot and killed by the National Guard at Kent State University. These were kids shooting other kids because of ideological differences, because of fear, because of listening to orders instead of thinking critically for themselves. This was the time when I began watching the news  seeing horrific images of Vietnamese villagers being bombed with napalm, seeing friends return from Vietnam with deep psychological, if not physical, wounds. I still remember well the iconic image of the young Vietnamese girl after being hit by napalm - an agent used in flamethrowers, bombs and tanks that sticks to the skin and causes severe burning. I struggled to see how this was in any way an effective or humane way to solve conflict.As a result of my developing awareness of the horrors of war, I campaigned tirelessly as a young high school and university student against the insanity of this, or any, war. I pushed back against the system that promoted war as a means to resolve problems, felt frustration, sadness, anger at the shocking acts of violence I was seeing around me. I knew that there had to be an alternative to this insanity, to the inhumane ways in which humans treated one anotherand I was quite keen on seeking out that alternative.No longer wanting my heart to be broken with pain and grief, I made the decision to dedicate my life to working towards peace. After a long and circuitous path I arrived at Project Ploughshares Calgary (PPC), a place where people who care deeply about peace can meet, share their concerns and interests and be heard. Where working together in constructive and life-affirming ways in such a group, we can create the peaceful and just world that we all want. I now hold the position of Program Director with Project Ploughshares Calgary where I can use the peacebuilding skills Id been honing over the years.Martin Luther King has been one of my inspirations and his work a motivating factor in studying and working in the field of peace and conflict transformation. As he said, Almost always, the creative dedicated minority has made the world better.","Project Ploughshares is uniquely positioned as the largest peace education organization in Canada. We develop programs that specifically address issues of creating a more peaceful community  both locally and globally. On an on-going basis, we provide the following programming and services to Calgarians:We hold a monthly Peace Education presentation that brings in speakers with expertise on various issues pertaining to peace: Women as Peacebuilders, Non-Killing Political Science, Spirituality and the Environment, Youth and Restorative Justice, Cooperative Games, The Internet and Cyberbullying, Peaceful Parenting in the 21st Century.We deliver an annual Spring Workshop, spending a weekend delving into a peace-related topic. Some of the past workshops have been devoted to Arms Control, Trustbuilding, Environmental Issues and Peace, Nuclear Abolition, Conflict Transformation, and many other topics. This years workshop will focus on youth engagement, and is entitled Peacing It Together: Calgary Youth Speak Up, and will include Image Theatre, a panel of young people talking about how they engage within their own communities, a social justice hip-hop artist, and time for small group work to develop community initiatives that focus on building peaceful communities.Project Ploughshares also produces a monthly newsletter, detailing our own work during the month, as well as providing details about other peace-related organizations and peace activities that are going on in Calgary.We hold a Remembrance Day service annually at the Calgary Community Peace Pole.For 3 years, we held the Calgary Peace Run  Walk Festival, with 5K and 10K runs and walks. This event has been incredible in terms of raising community awareness around peace.Our annual Holiday Peace Fair is always a crowd-pleasing event that attracts some 30 organizations that sell items that are ethically made, fairly traded, and help to support peace, social justice and environmental groups and initiatives. We conduct an annual Toy Audit of Calgary toy stores during the fall, in anticipation of the holiday shopping season. We look for the numbers of peaceful toys versus violent toys, and rate the stores based on specific criteria. Those stores with a rating of Excellent receive a certificate that can be put up in their stores. We send the results of our audit to all Calgary media during the month of November.Project Ploughshares is a key partner in the annual Floating Lantern Festival, which is held to remember those impacted by the bombings at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The event takes place at the reflecting pool at Olympic Plaza. Last years event saw some 500 people at Olympic Plaza; we are trying to attract even more people for this coming years extended event, where we will have a mini peace festival taking place prior to setting our lanterns on the pool in the evening.Vision:A secure world without war - a just world at peace.Mandate:Founded in 1976, Project Ploughshares is the peace centre of The Canadian Council of Churches, mandated to work with churches, governments, and civil society, in Canada and abroad, to advance policies and actions that prevent war and armed violence and build peace. Project Ploughshares carries out its mandate by undertaking research, policy development, and public engagement to:Prohibit the use, possession, and manufacture of nuclear weapons;Prevent the weaponization of space;Control the supply and reduce the demand for weaponsReduce the resort to military force; andBuild sustainable peace.A key task of Project Ploughshares is to encourage new ways of thinking about security in which the focus of security is the economic, political, and social welfare of people, rather than the military power of states. The research and analysis of Project Ploughshares is listened to and sought out by NGOs and government. The broad and engaged constituency of thousands of individuals, along with Canadian and international partnerships, contributes to a higher level of public debate and more comprehensive policy analysis.We believe: The most immediate threats to the security of vulnerable people derive from unmet economic and health needs, political exclusion, denied rights, social and political disintegration, and the criminal and political violence that accompany conditions of chronic insecurity. This means that security preparedness involved much more than military strength. A comprehensive approach to security required attention to and funding for the 5Ds of security: development, democracy, disarmament, diplomacy and defence.Development  end poverty and create economic conditions conducive to sustainable human security;Democracy  promote good governance, political inclusiveness, participation, and respect for human rights;Disarmament  prevent the transformation of political conflict into armed conflict by limiting weapons;Diplomacy  support the peaceful settlement of disputes and a rules-based international order;Defence  ensure that the use of force in extraordinary circumstance supports the full range of peace and security efforts (the other 4Ds).","As a peace education group Project Ploughshares provides talks, workshops and written material to feed those who need feeding, food (information and programming) that comes from very high levels of peacemaking and academia in Canada and the rest of the world.In the 33 years of its existence, Project Ploughshares Calgary has been sought out by people who wish to actually do something about issues such as the existence of nuclear weapons, the proliferation of arms sales around the world, bullying in schools and particular conflicts happening in the world such as the Iraq invasions, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sierra Leone and Syria. PPC has provided an outlet for action to Calgarians who are concerned. PPC also works with emerging as well as ongoing interests that involve peace-building within our community. We brought together 57 community, ethnic, faith and other groups to create the Calgary Community Peace Pole and Plaza. Further opportunities for engagement annually occur at our Peace Fair where some 30 environment, social justice and peace groups gather to sell their goods and at the Peace Remembrance Day service at the Peace Pole.We have a number of upcoming programs that we expect will make an impact on the community in terms of learning more about peacebuilding.1. Youth Focus - We currently have a particular focus on youth, for as Gandhi said, If we are to reach real peace in the worldwe shall have to begin with the children. We take this seriously and as a result have held many programs during the past couple of years that focus exclusively on youth. These have included programs on Peaceful Parenting, Cooperative Games, The Internet and Cyberbullying, and Youth Restorative Justice. We have also presented sessions entitled What IS Peace Education? at the Calgary Teachers Convention, and at an Interfaith Conference and the Faculty of Social Work  the latter both at the University of Calgary. We have also done sessions on Fair Trade and Stereotyping  Discrimination at the Diversity and Student for Change annual conference at Bob Edward Junior High.Peacing It Together: Calgary Youth Speak UpOur annual Spring Workshop, to be held at the end of April 2015, is called Peacing It Together: Calgary Youth Speak Up. The focus will be on engaging youth in developing and initiating peace-related projects in their communities. We hope to have 25 young people come and experience the power of Image Theatre, which will be facilitated by an expert in this field, with the afternoon featuring a youth panel talking about their own views of social justice and peace, what that means to them, and how they feel they can work effectively in their own communities. The last session will be small group sessions, where creativity and imagination will be encouraged in developing plans to work for peace and justice in the Calgary community.Peace Studies CourseProject Ploughshares, working with the Calgary Board of Education, is working on developing a course in Peace Studies for Grade Eleven Social Studies students. Our initiative fills an important gap within the high school social studies curriculum in the area of peacebuilding, and will incorporate modules dealing with youth in war, radicalization of youth, human security, cultural diversity, and youth restorative justice. These are indicative of current critical issues that have a great deal of relevance for youth today. The goal is that students make a personal connection to what they are learning in the classroom and develop critical and creative thinking skills which enable them to become peacebuilding-oriented when faced with conflict.As the largest peace education organization in Canada, Project Ploughshares is uniquely placed to create a Locally Developed Course (LDC) for Alberta high schools on competencies in violent conflict prevention, conflict resolution, and the principles of peacebuilding, and awareness of modern-day causes of radicalization and conflict. This course will support students in becoming engaged thinkers and ethical citizens, as outlined by Alberta Education. Additionally, it is directly aligned with Project Ploughshares mission and strategic plan in the promotion and development of peace education.Our LDC will be first introduced as a CBe-Learn online course which is open to all CBE students. This course has the potential to reach thousands of Alberta senior high school students.2. Floating Lantern Festival: Remembering Hiroshima, Creating PeaceHeld annually for the past 3 years at Olympic Plaza, this is a commemorative event, open to the public, in memory of those whose lives were lost or irreparably damaged by the atomic bomb attacks on Hiroshima August 6 and Nagasaki August 9 in 1945, and also of all human life lost or destroyed by warfare. 2015 marks the 70th anniversary of these bombings. Oral presentations and music will be followed by audience participation in the placement of floating lanterns on the surface of the water. The event will begin about 5 PM with a mini-festival including food and water but no alcoholic beverages. The festival will include activities for children (including yoga and a storytelling tent), music, drama and speakers. Last years event was attended by over 500 people; we would like to make that number even bigger this year in order to raise awareness and educate more people about the dangers of nuclear weapons.3. Annual Toy AuditOctober 2015 will be our third year of doing an audit of Calgary toy stores. Volunteers visited 12 Calgary toy stores, examining the shelves for violent and non-violent toys and games, books and videos. We looked for games and toys that encourage the use of weapons (historical and modern) for solving conflicts; we looked for how the message was communicated on packaging; we checked the location of toys and games on shelves and in displays; and we checked to see if video sections were following the Alberta ranking and age appropriate rules. One of the main outcomes of this project is raising awareness of the prevalence of violent messages and violent solutions that are given to our children, and promoting that there are healthier and more sustainable alternatives.Results of the audit are sent out to all Calgary media during November.4. Annual Ploughshares Peace FairNovember 2015 will be the 31st annual fair for Project Ploughshares Calgary. This fair sells goods from some 30 organizations who work in the fields of social justice, fair trade, and the environment. It is always very well attended by Calgarians, and serves to bring awareness of issues of peace and justice to the greater community.5. Remembrance Day CeremonyEach year on Remembrance Day, Project Ploughshares holds a small ceremony at the Calgary Community Peace Pole to remember all lives lost in war. This past years ceremony was calledRespecting Past Sacrifices, Looking to the Future, and focused on not only remembering the past, but the need to learn from it and create a peaceful world.The following programs need financial support - for amounts required, see details in our WHAT YOU CAN DO section:Spring Workshop  Peacing It Together: Calgary Youth Speak Up  April 25, 2015Floating Lantern Festival: Remembering Hiroshima, Creating Peace August 6, 2015Peace Studies Course Development July 2015  June 2016.","You can volunteer with Project Ploughshares Calgary.

"208",757,"Prostate Cancer Canada Network Calgary Society (Prostaid Calgary Society)","One Mans Story by Bob ShiellMy journey with prostate cancer started about 12 years ago with a phone call frommy father. At age 75 he had been diagnosed with metastasis prostate cancer. Ihad just turned 50. My knowledge of prostate cancer was very limited. I calledour family doctor who filled me in with information about what to expect withmy father and also suggested that I start regular psa testing. I soon startedgetting regular dres and psa tests. My father went on to hormonal therapy andlived another 4 years, ultimately dying of a heart attack.During this period every time I went for a test I heard everythingsnormal. When I was 55, my psa came back at 3.6 and I was sent to anurologist. Again, everythings normal - come back next year. Thefollowing year my psa climbed to 5.6 and a subsequent biopsy gave me a Gleasonscore of 6, and six positive core samples out of 6 taken. I had prostatecancer!My urologist told me that surgery was my best option, but because of the extent ofthe cancer and the good possibility of it having spread outside the capsule, hewould have to be aggressive in his surgery. He assured me I would most likelybe impotent, and possibly suffer from incontinence. Radiation was alsomentioned as a secondary treatment if the surgery failed. Needless to say I wasin shock! I was 56 and I had thought, healthy. My routine for over 8 years wasto swim a mile a day, watch what I eat and drink and not smoke. I had nosymptoms and felt great. But suddenly I felt like my life was over.After getting over the initial shock I decided to be equally aggressive in my searchfor treatment options. I went first to the library. Remember, this was almostsix years ago. The books I found were not very helpful. Most dealt with surgery the operation, recovery, living with side effects, etc. While I was doingresearch I sent copies of my biopsy slides to Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospitalin New York for a second opinion. I also sought out and had an appointment withanother urologist in another city. The internet provided me with links to othertreatments, to survivors, and prostate cancer specialists. To make a long storyshort I finally linked up with Dr. Haakon Ragde in Seattle, Washington. Hisrecommendation was three-fold. A 4 month course of hormones (Zoladex and Flutamide),25 sessions of external beam radiation and finally brachytherapy  theinsertion of tiny radioactive seeds directly into the prostate gland underultrasound guidance.I went with his recommendations. The hormonal therapy and external beam radiationwas provided by the caring staff at Tom Baker Cancer Centre in Calgary. Asbrachy was not yet available in Canada I had that procedure done in Seattle. Ifinished my treatment in December, 1997.Now over seven years out and my psa is stable at 0.1. My quality of life isexcellent. Knowing what I know now, would I do it again? Absolutely. But I alsorecognize that my choice of treatment, while right for me, is not necessarilyright for others.Since my diagnosis I have become very active in the prostate cancer support community. I took over as President of PCCN Calgary (the local support group) four years ago, and in January 2003, became President of the Prostate Cancer Canada Network.Prostate Cancer support groups fulfill an important role. They are there when the newlydiagnosed need someone to talk to right now! They can also provide up-to-dateinformation on various treatment modalities. Many groups regularly featuremedical guest speakers at monthly meetings to keep members informed. Buildingawareness for early detection and advocating for treatment options are alsoimportant functions of the groups.PCCN Calgarys mission statement says it all: Our objective is to assist andsupport patients, families and friends as they deal with prostate cancer. Weinform, empathize and reassure men on their journey. We share our experienceswith our own cancer, lift our spirits and strengthen our resolve to fight forquality of life and a cure.PCCN is the national organization representing some 120 independent support groupsacross the country. PCCN speaks for tens of thousands of men suffering fromprostate cancer to government and business. PCCN builds awareness throughprojects like Living Proof  a national awareness campaignfeaturing prostate cancer survivors and a soon to be released nationaltelevision campaign featuring Red Green.What can be done to help in the battle with prostate cancer? If youre a man over 50or over 40 with a family history of cancer, talk to your doctor about gettingtested. Watch your diet and exercise regularly.

"209",144,"Prostate Cancer Centre","My story starts when I got the news from my brother in 2008 that he was diagnosed with prostate cancer. He was 61 years old and in good health and was diligent about getting his annual physical which included both the digital and PSA tests. His PSA was elevated which led to the biopsy confirming cancer. He elected to have the Radical Prostatectomy and has fully recovered.In 2009, I decided to join the Calgary Ride for Dad in support of prostate cancer research and education and dedicated my participation to my brother and his success in the battle with prostate cancer. He attributes the success to early detection through annual checkups. Little did I know that in less than two months I would also be diagnosed with the disease, also at age 61.I had been getting annual physicals from age thirty and prostate checks became a part of the routine in my mid forties. I am fortunate that my current family doctor is very thorough when it comes to medical examinations. When I mentioned my brothers diagnosis, he sent me off to the Calgary Prostate Cancer Centre when he noticed an abnormality in the digital exam. The subsequent biopsy confirmed cancer and after considering the options, I opted for the surgery. Im happy to report that everything went well and Im pretty much back to normal.I cant say enough about the Calgary Prostate Cancer Centre and the great work they do with prostate cancer research and education.During my pre-op visits I guess I was too preoccupied to notice the Resource Centre and the wealth of information that was available. It was only later that I decided to attend an evening session that involved short presentations from professionals that spoke about healthy diets, physical fitness, yoga programs and pelvic floor rehabilitation. My recovery was certainly enhanced by putting to practice some of the information received at this wellness clinic.I was impressed by the dedication of the staff and volunteers at the Prostate Cancer Centre and in 2010 I signed up with the Man Vanas a driver. The program is dedicated to raise awareness to men in their early forties of the importance of getting a PSA test for baseline reference.

Annually, over 12,000 patients visit the Prostate Cancer Centre. The Centre pursues its mission by reaching out to individuals, corporations, and others to channel resources  both financial and human  to fight this deadly disease.In 2009, the Prostate Cancer Centre introduced the Man VanProgram. This program goes out into the communities of Calgary. In 2013 a second Man Van was added to go out to communities in rural southern Alberta. Its two mobile PSA (prostate specific antigen) blood testing clinics not only provide baseline PSA tests for men aged 40 and older, but they also create awareness about the importance of early detection of prostate cancer as it is treatable if caught early.2015 Impact:Our Mens Health Program is powered by the ManVan and expands mobile testing beyond the PSA (Prostate Specific Antigen)by offering additional health measurements including: Body Mass Index (BMI),blood pressure and blood sugar.

"210",588,"Providence Child Development Society","Often, families come to Providence at a very difficult time in their lives. First, the realization their child may not be developing typically; then, seemingly endless doctors appointments, medical tests and assessments . . . and more doctors appointments. Often, there remains a lot of questions and very few answers, and uncertainty about the future for their precious child and for their family as a whole.Parents tell us stories of harsh judgement by strangers in grocery stores and playgrounds and a shrinking pool of friends as their child is excluded from birthday parties and backyard barbeques. We know parents who have taken their child to 11 doctors appointments in two weeks; parents whose child is 5 and hasnt slept more than two hours at a time; a child who has been turned away from 17 childcare facilities because they cannot handle his behaviour; and moms who have chosen to end their professional careers to care full-time for their child.The stress can be hard on family relationships, and its often difficult to know where to turn or what to do next for your child. But parents tell us the hardest part is wondering if anyone will be able to love and care for their child as they do, and entrusting their childs care to strangers.At Providence, we know. We care. And we can help.-----Providence Origins: Martha Cohen and Providence CrecheMartha Cohen was President of Providence Creche for two years and spent 10 years on the Board of Governors in the early years.. She was the first Jewish woman to hold the position of President.The followingstory was submitted by Marthas daughter, Cheryl, on the occasion of Providences 70th anniversary:Martha held a meeting at her home, this was likely in the mid-1950s. The doorbell to our home rang and Marthas son, Philip, ran to answer the door. Outside were a group of nuns wearing their full habits. Philip had never seen nuns before and yelled to his mom that there was a group of wicked witches at the door and he thinks they might have legs. Needless to say, soon afterward Philip received his first lesson about nuns and Catholicism.It was through Marthas work at Providence Creche that she met Father Patrick OByrne. From time to time, Father OByrne would come to our home to swim in our pool. One day my sister, Faye, asked Father OByrne how many children did he have. He answered none and Faye was insistent that he had children because he was called Father. Another lesson in Catholicism.For more stories from Providences past, read Our Stories: http://providencechildren.com/about-us/our-stories/","Over 70 years, Providence has grown and changed to meet the needs of Calgary families. From a population of less than 100,000 in 1943, to over a million people spread over 835 square kilometers today, Calgary has kept the best of its western heritage, but become so much more. And Providence has done the same. From its roots as a foster home for abandoned children, Providence has kept pace with a growing population and the changing needs of the community.Our Mission: To enhance the health and development of children and their families.Our Vision: We believe every child deserves a chance to reach for and achieve their full potential. Working with the child, family and community, Providence provides the opportunity to build foundations that will last a lifetime.Our Values:We are dedicated to excellence in all our programs relating to the child, the family and the community.We believe that children deserve a joyful, supportive, respectful and secure environment that stimulates exploration, learning and growth in all areas of development.We know that learning is driven by the childs curiosity and individual readiness, so our task is to provide age-appropriate and developmentally-appropriate opportunities and expectations for each child.We believe that every opportunity should be taken to prevent or ameliorate disabling conditions in children, including early interventions that can make a life-long difference.We believe in ensuring that the community at large is sensitive to, and supportive of, the developmental needs of children with diverse abilities and backgrounds.We believe in providing inclusive, integrated and normalized environments so that children with disabilities have the same opportunities and experiences as are available to their normally-developing peers.Our Values are continued here: About Providence Children: Mission/Vision/Values.Our Accomplishments: Providence has always prided itself on changing and growing to meet the needs of Calgarians.To address our growing waiting lists, we expanded our McKenzie Towne School to accommodate 70 additional students annually, with the addition of 3 new classrooms and an additional therapy room.Based on our reputation and our expertise, Providence is now the sole provider in the southern Alberta region of a government-funded program, Supported Child Care. The program provides expertise and support to child care programs that care for young children with extra needs or challenging behaviours.Thanks to a recent grant from The Calgary Foundation, Providence is developing and delivering training and education opportunities for child care workers so they can better identify and support children with extra needs.","School-based programs: Students get the expert attention they need - and deserve - to thrive: Each child has a direct, daily intensive educational and therapeutic program delivered by a team of certified teachers, speech-language pathologists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, behavioural specialists, psychologists and educational and therapeutic assistants who work right in the classroom alongside the children.Our low child-to-staff ratios allow for individual and small group support when necessary, while at the same time developing childrens skills in a social, play-based program.Early Intervention (19 months  30 months)Enriched Preschool (30 months to 4 years)Junior Kindergarten (4 to 5 years)Kindergarten (5 to 6 years) Community-based Programs:School locations: Windsor Park, Midnapore, McKenzie Towne, Beddington, Hawkwood, FalconridgeCommunity-based programs: Our therapists provide critical early assessment and treatment to children through partnerships with childcare facilities and independent schools.

It just so happened that the day they picked was the schools Christmas celebration and they were able to join the festivities:The school is amazing! The organization is second to none. The staff dedicated to the wellbeing of the children. The management is hands on and so proud of what they do. But the biggest indicator of how well this facility operates is the happy children!Their smiles tell the story. We were treated to crafts that were made for us when they knew we would be visiting and the children could not wait to give them to us. There is nothing more infectious than a smiling happy child and Providence is full of them. The school caters to all of the needs of the children both with physical equipment and emotional support. What they do is truly amazing and we are proud to support their cause.Providence is committed to ensuring our services are available to all students, and provides all services (including transportation,nutrition program and field trips)at no charge to parents.If you want to know what YOU can do to help, consider these ideas:Ourstudents need help getting to school.You can help to ensure students safely get to school.

"211",264,"Punjabi Community Health Services Calgary","A Wifes Story:Canada was my dream. I dont know how this dream turned into a nightmare for me. Married 12 years ago in India, I was left behind to raise two young sons when my husband immigrated to Canada. Finally when I joined him 5 years later with my children, my life turned upside down. With the stress of settling in a new country and the financial difficulties, his alcohol binges increased, and the occasional casual slaps escalated to violent beatings.I covered the bruises or avoided being seen. At first it was only me, but then also my older son. I didnt speak English, knew few people, and felt as though there was nowhere to turn. I didnt know the ways or systems here, and they dont understand my culture. What was I to do?I could not go back. My mother always said from now on your husbands home is your heaven or hell, you have to live there. One night his anger was so fierce, I ended up in hospital. The police asked if I wished to press charges. But what would I do then, who would support me? What would my family say? How would we manage  with my sons in school, and no income and no one to turn to ? What do I do, where do I go?Then a lady at the hospital connected me with PCHS. The PCHS worker came to see me at the hospital, and soon my life started getting better. I felt connected, understood, supported and stronger.The case worker was Punjabi and I could speak openly in my language! She helped arrange counselling for me, my husband and my sons. I made friends at the Womens Support group, and my husband said he enjoyed and learnt so much at the Parenting classes, even about anger management! He said he was not as stressed since taking the financial literacy course, and I am happy he is attending the AA meetings. I now feel I have many friends and my children will have a good life in Canada A Fathers Story:I didnt understand why Child Services knocked at our door, or what allowed them to walk through our home and take our daughter away, or declare us unfit parents.We are hard working parents and have been in Canada for 10 years. We want to give our children a good life! I work two jobs and my wife works one job. Sometimes we are both not home in the evenings, when the children come home from school. Then our older son who is 15 years old looks after his younger sister, that is the culture, as the older brother he protects and looks after his little sister. And then, government officers took our daughter away. They said she complained to her friends and the school teacher that her brother hits her and was mean to her. That is her brother, why would he do that? They tell us our son said that he hated looking after her.They say that we will need to meet with a case worker and an investigation will be launched. How will I get the time off from my work? I may lose my daughter ? Where did we go wrong, what did we not understand, how do we get our daughter back?That is when we approached PCHS, and they helped us understand the Canadian laws, and worked with Child Services to help get our daughter back home. We have been attending the Punjabi Parenting classes, and have learned new skills to support our children, to teach them to be resilient and strong, to succeed in Canada. Our son now also volunteers with PCHS. We are thankful we have been able to keep our family together.Twilight Tears:I am 78 years old, I live with my son in Canada, as a widower, I am very lonely. My grandchildren only speak English which I do not understand, my son and daughter in law are at work all day and in the evenings they have very little time for me. I cannot visit my friends or go to the senior centre as my knees are bad and I cannot walk so far to the bus stop. If I complain, they tell mewhat more do you want, we called you here didnt we.However since my children and grandchildren have begun attending the PCHS parenting class my life feels better. My grandchildren ask me to teach them Punjabi, then sometimes even ask about India and what it was like for me growing up.. Although they dont understand all I say, I like very much that they are trying to learn Punjabi, and someday ...At PCHS we help support our clients in their own language and within our common cultural context; we teach families skills and tools to strengthen relationships and succeed in Canada. We help them navigate and connect with the appropriate community resources and agencies.","PCHS Calgary offers supportive counselling to South Asian clients and their families: through assisting clients to find effective solutions within their own cultural context; help them identify and navigate access to appropriate Community Resources; and provide clients ongoing support post treatments or professional counselling sessions.PCHS Calgary recognizes South Asian cultural norms of defining illness, acknowledging social problems and seeking resolution, and leverages these understandings to deliver services in a culturally appropriate manner for optimal effectiveness for its clients.Our Vision: Thriving CommunitiesOur Mission: Fostering Partnerships To Promote Happy Healthy and Succesful FamiliesOur Objectives:Understand the goals and challenges of the South Asian community in Calgary.Provide culturally and linguistically appropriate programs and supports to promote healthy, happy and successful families.Develop equitable partnerships with Calgary community agencies to foster collaborations for thriving communities.----Punjabi Community Health Services (PCHS) Calgary was established as a standalone not for profit society, modeled on the very successful Punjabi Community Health Services operating in Ontario since 1990 (http://www.pchs4u.com/). It has operated a succesful monthly Womens Support Group program launched in 2013. In April 2015 PCHS rolled out a well received and growing whole-family (parents, grandparents  children) bi-monthly Parenting program, in response to community needs assessments identified through a Family Forum event. While PCHS has been providing supportive counselling related to alcohol, drug addictions and domestic violence for some families and referrals to appropriate agencies, the agency is on target to roll out a more extensive trained volunteer based supportive counselling program for June 2015.PCHS Ontario is a not for profit charitable organization and is a pioneer in the cross-cultural understanding of providing health and social services in our diverse Canadian population. PCHS Ontarios Integrated Holistic Service Delivery Model incorporates a foundational understanding of the differences between South Asian and Western cultures, differences which impact the effective delivery of social and health care services.","PCHS recognizes that a culturally competent system of care acknowledges the importance of culture, assessment of cross-cultural interactions, vigilance toward the dynamics resulting from cultural differences, expansion of cultural knowledge, adaptation to meet culturally unique needs which then result in providing better outcomes for our South Asian clients. PCHS incorporates this Integrated Holistic Service Delivery Model into our Supportive Counselling program which is run by trained community volunteers. This model serves the collectivist family-centric South Asian cultures wherein the clients and his/her family also become a client.Support and skill building are provisioned to the whole family, unless the client decides not to have the family involved. Thus orientation, intake and care plans incorporate rapport building with the client and the family. We believe these culturally competent services are needed to address service delivery from an equity perspective, by increasing the accessibility and the quality of services for diverse populations, thereby producing better outcomes.ThePCHS Parenting Programprovides appropriate linguistic and cultural world-view education to help bridge the cultural gap between South Asian immigrants and their children schooled and raised in Canada. It is based on a holistic approach of providing parenting education to the entire family including children. The program addresses concerns of child-rearing faced by families that can at worse escalate to issues of domestic violence, mental health and addiction. This program aims to mitigate and prevent high-risk family strife situations and government agency intervention; and to create harmony within the nuclear South Asian family.TheSAHARA Womens Support Groupis run by community women to support, mentor and empower each other and fellow South Asian women, in a private and comfortable setting.PCHS facilitates a South Asian Professional Inter-Agency Collaboration which meets with community members to develop partnerships, to address areas of need identified through our Community Needs Assessment","There are many ways to be involved at Punjabi Community Health Services Calgary.1. Volunteer​Volunteers are provided training in supportive outreach and counselling services through engaging the whole family, the South Asian community  spiritual resources, family physicians, and any needed main stream agencies to best support the clients and their families.

"212",333,"Quest Theatre Society","Our dream is for all children to have the opportunity to be inspired and uplifted through imagination, creativity and play, regardless of their circumstances. To that end we are always looking for new ways to nurture young people through exceptional adventures in theatre. So when we found out that 53% of residents at the emergency shelter with Inn from the Cold were children, we were eager to get involved.We reached out to their team and together determined that providing a free performance of our Christmas Stories show to these children and their families would make the biggest impact.Although space in the shelters is limited, the Inn from the Cold team was incredible and determined to find us a place to perform. Meanwhile ourteam dreamed up imaginative ways to adapt the show to meet the needs of this special performance. As word began to spread to the shelter community, excitement was quickly growing.The night of the performance was very cold and snowy. We were thrilled as we watched excited children pouring in with their families. The kids were ecstatic to be there and jumped around with glee as the show began. Their enthusiasm was infectious as they sang along and shared their thoughts aloud throughout the performance. The little ones were so eager to be apart of the adventure that they would storm the stage whenever we asked for an audience member to help. We could see the joy the children felt reflected on many of their parents faces as they smiled, able to forget for a moment where they were.From my seat, I overheard one little one say to his mom:This is the best Christmas ever! I could hardly hold back my tears. This little guy was living in a shelter. But it was true. We were warm inside, singing Christmas carols,drinking hot chocolate and sucking on candy canes.After the show, the performers were flooded with kids looking for hugs, and a chance to further explore the set and puppets. The space was full to bursting with Christmas cheer and happy faces.Moments like these are what Quest Theater is all about.How lovely to think that no one need wait a moment. We can start now, start slowly, changing the world. - Anne Frank (1929  1945)http://questtheatre.org/our-programs/community-outreach/","Quest Theatres vision is to nurture young people through exceptional adventures in theatre, globally.

"213",770,"Recovery Acres (Calgary) Society / 1835 House","We are proud to share the following story from a member of our alumni:                    I began drinking in the seventh grade. My drinking increased through high school. When I went to work in the oil patch at the age of 18, drinking and drug taking became a way of life. I was married at age 20 and my addictions began to have consequences; trouble with my wife, parents, friends and the law. To all of this I was oblivious. By the time I was 39 I had lost two wives and two sets of children, all of my friends, my home, my job, and I was bankrupt.Facing life on the street, I reached out for help, but no matter what I did or what others did to help me, I could not stay clean and sober. After detoxing 11 times in 14 months I was referred to Recovery Acres. I cannot say enough about this program and what it did for me. The counselors helped me understand my alcoholism and addictions; they walked me through the 12 steps of AA, they taught me to live and stay clean and sober. While at Recovery Acres I learned what needed to be changed in me in order to go out into the world and become successful in every area of my life. I was also introduced to a spiritual understanding which was instrumental in my recovery.While in Recovery Acres Residential Treatment Program I began studies that would prepare me for a change in career. When I completed the program I began a career as a Financial Advisor and now 24 years later I own a successful business which has given me a fantastic life, a beautiful home, travel and all the perks that one associates with success. I am also a competitive triathlete and Ironman which brings me great joy and happiness. None of this would have been possible without the help and support of Recovery Acres and their counselors. My relationship with Recovery Acres is ongoing and I still drop by once a week for lunch. Had I sat down on the first day in treatment and dreamed about how good life would be I would have never have imagined how things have turned out.-----Recovery Acres is a registered charity that operates a fully accredited addiction treatment center. We have helped over 13,000 people over more than 40 years through our mens treatment center, 1835 House.For decades women have seen the positive impact 1835 House has had on the men in their lives and have asked for a program of their own. In September 2016 Recovery Acres responded by opening CARE (Co-occurring Addiction Recovery Essentials) for Women, an intensive, clinical outpatient program.Recovery Acres provides gender-specific addiction treatment for adults. Specialized psychological treatment to address co-occurring mental health challenges is available.Rick D.","Our recovery centre is situated in a quiet, residential area of southwest Calgary.

"214",773,"Rowan House Society","Imagine for a minute that your partner is no longer the person you fell in love with. No, you didnt just grow your separate ways. No. One day your partner showed his true self and he turned out to be manipulative and violent.Maybe that side of him would peek through after a stressful day at work or a night of drinking with his buddies and he would come around the next morning telling you he was sorry and didnt mean to hurt you. And you love him so you believe him.You hide the bruises with long sleeve shirts and makeup and put a smile on your face. But then it happens again, and again.Finally, you have a choice. Its not an easy one, but in a panic, you leave.Staying with your partner could mean your life, but leaving is still terrifying. Staying was painful but it was comfortable, now youre venturing into the unknown. Youre probably feeling confused and alone.A womans initial contact with Rowan House typically starts with a call to our crisis line where her story, much like the one you just read, can be heard. If she agrees that our programming is a good fit and space is available she will begin her journey with us.Once settled in, women and their children find community at Rowan House. They see other families are going through the same thing and they are not alone.Women dont have to worry about where their next meal is going to come from or ensuring their children have clothes on their backs, they can focus on coping and accessing services for moving forward.Children also find comfort with our staff. They learn how to regulate their emotions and deal with the violence that theyve witnessed or even experienced themselves.Our staff encourage women to see themselves as complete and whole. We believe in second chances, new opportunities and homes free of violence.As a past resident once said, This is the best place to heal, grow and educate yourself. Bless each family and woman in their journey to greatness.","We are a short-term womens emergency shelter located in the Foothills of southern Alberta.Our mission is to provide crisis intervention, long-term support and education for those affected by family violence in rural communities. In doing so, we work to fulfill our vision: that every person is safe and secure, and lives without abuse.Our goal is to provide women and their children a safe environment that nourishes feelings of self-worth, lends an opportunity for healing and personal growth, and provides temporary housing while facilitating transition back into the community.Safety, trustworthiness, choice, collaboration and empowerment are our core values.After the devastating floods of 2013, Rowan House became one of the first shelters in Alberta to embark on a journey toward a trauma-informed domestic violence service. Rowan House Trauma Informed services take into account an understanding of trauma in all aspects of service delivery. This means to put safety first and specifically avoid re-traumatizing those in our care and on our staff. It changes the question from whats wrong with you? to whats happened to you? Our Executive Director has presented both locally and internationally on Trauma Informed Care in a Domestic Violence Shelter, highlighting the work being done at Rowan House in this area, as well as a workshop on The Importance of Self Care and the Impact of Vicarious Trauma and Compassion Fatigue, specifically on shelter workers. We serve a large rural area including the communities of Okotoks, High River, Black Diamond, Turner Valley, Millarville, Longview, Blackie, Nanton, Vulcan, Claresholm and the surrounding areas.Our Report to the Community: Shelter Statistics (April2016 - March 2017)​200 New admissions to our Emergency Shelter (92 women +108 children)1,343Calls to our 24/7 Crisis Line80%of residents were first time users2,206Total Visits to our Child Support Program(4,157 programming hours)2,131Students (97 presentations) were reached by our preventative education team369people were turnedaway (236 due to capacity + 133 for other reasons)","Our Shelterprogram provides a safe, supportive environment for women and children who find themselves in a crisis situation and in need of emergency housing. We have trauma-informed shelter counsellors who operate our 24-hour crisis line, provide solution-focused counselling, safety planning, and community referrals and client advocacy in a number of areas. Women often come to us with nothing but the clothes on their back. We have 24 beds and provide food and other basic necessities as families work to transition back into the community, all at no cost to them.In our 2015-2016 fiscal year we admitted 97 women and 124 children.The Outreach program is designed to address and meet the needs of women who have experienced abuse, are experiencing abuse, or are at risk of experiencing abuse, through one-on-one contact and support. Clients need not reside at the shelter to access services from the Outreach Program. The Outreach counsellors caseload is predominately women in the community who are not ready to come into the shelter, or are not in need of the housing aspect, but require services to keep themselves and their children safe from abuse.61 women and 40 children were served this past fiscal year.Our Child Support program is operated by staff trained to work with children who have witnessed abuse and the developmental issues that may cause. The program focuses on building self-esteem and teaching children coping skills for managing anxiety.We also offer moms individual sessions that help foster and strengthen the relationship mother and child have.OurBranches Preventative Education program provides education and awareness about the cycle of abuse, as well as the effects abuse has upon families. We provide a series of free, education presentations that address family violence, teen dating violence, healthy relationships, bullying and self-esteem, as well as information about Rowan House and the services and programs offered. These presentations are offered to schools, community groups and other agencies.In addition, a six-week Healthy Relationship Education group is offered free of charge to women in the community eight times a year and twice weekly for residents.In our newly created Shelter Transition program, partnering with the Foothills Foundation and the Town of High River, we have four subsidized housing units available for our residents to rent as they leave the crisis shelter. There is currently a lack of safe, affordable transitional housing options in our area, which creates an ongoing problem for both our residents trying to leave the shelter and those waiting to get in, leading to a high number of turnaways from our emergency shelter.In our last fiscal year, a total of 694 women and children had to be turned away - almost 54% due to Rowan House being at capacity. We recently concluded a feasibility study on Transitional Housing/Second Stage Housing and are working to develop a plan for expanding this program.","Rowan House Emergency Shelter relies on the generosity of individual and corporate donors as we only receive government funds for just over half of our budget. Rowan House Society must raise $800,000 for current operations and programming. This would not include any costs incurred for our new Transitional Housing Program.Rowan House has three top priorities for the use of fundraised dollars including:Branches Preventative EducationTransitional HousingEmergency Shelter Basic Client Related OperationsWe look forward to the opportunity to discuss the many ways you can help bring hope to women and children fleeing family violence. Some options include financial contributions, sponsorship of our annual Hope  Healing Galaor hosting a third party fundraiser, planned giving, employee matching gifts and choosing Rowan House as your charity of choice if your company is part of the United Way Donor Choice Program.

She had a medical condition that required ongoing support and assistance from her current caregiver, her husband, who was also her abuser. Annie was experiencing ongoing emotional abuse and felt powerless to leave the situation because of her complex medical needs.Through our Peer Support Program, Annie was connected with a mentor who could provide ongoing support and connection. Annie and her mentor together were able to find community, medical and housing resources all while planning for her safety in and out of the relationship.  While connecting with community resources, Annie and her mentor also worked through issues of identity and self-esteem and began planning for the emotional healing that Annie wanted to embark on once being through her moment of crisis.Alongside support from Sagesse and her mentor, Annie was able to create and execute a safe exit plan for leaving her abusive husband. Now, she is within a safe, caring environment where her medical needs are being met, and she is able to continue working with her mentor on issues related to healing and processing the abuse she experienced. Annie and her mentor are also working on finding community resources to continue increasing her social inclusion. Annie says her relationship with Sagesse and her mentor have increased her self-esteem and allowed her to see the possibility of having safe, healthy relationships in her future. *names have been changed for confidentiality.Stories like this are why we exist.

After reviewing Jim and Lindas pensions and benefits, it was clear their monthly income should be closer to $2,700. We assisted them in getting all the paperwork and red tape addressed so they could start receiving the correct amount moving forward as well as receive a portion of retroactive benefits. We also assisted them in finding a suitable seniors apartment to move to.

James had burned all his bridges with family and friends and the only friend willing to take him in was one who was still active in his own addiction. James also lives with some major mental heath concerns. When James was referred to us through a past client he was in tears and stress about his next step as he only had two more weeks till he needed to leave the treatment centre. We have housed him through a community partner and have met with him weekly through staff or volunteers and are happy to report today he is living sober in his own place. We have 60 individuals and families we have helped get housing, it costs us $75 per month to provide the level of support James needs now he is housed (this support includes visits by staff or volunteers at least weekly to review how things are going, referrals as required, follow up with his doctors and supports, bus tickets or vouchers as required, and monthly review of his plan by staff).Your donation of $75 could help someone like JamesGary was a 67 year old male who came to us living in poverty as the only income he was receiving was $527 of CPP and a few hundred dollars a month from bottle picking. He came to us through 211 and was looking to find a way to get glasses as he had broken his and could not afford them and without them he could no longer pick bottles. We got him glasses two days later through a community partner (Calgary Eye Way Society) as he had no Seniors Health Benefits. Through the next three visits and numerous phone calls we were able to get his health benefit and all his pensions in place. Today Gary still lives in the same rooming house as he was living in when he first met with us but now with all pensions in place he receives slightly over $1,800 a month. There are many seniors in Calgary who are not receiving all their benefits, in fact 2 of 3 seniors referred to us are not getting their benefits. Our cost to do the work for Gary was $150, (Postage, mileage to meet Gary in the community twice, phone calls to follow up with applications, referrals, a few bus tickets, and three office visits).

Moving back to her community school, her new teacher recognizes that she has great abilities, inner strength and ideas, but limited initiative and opportunities to use them.That teacher decides to offer Tasha the opportunity to participate in a diversity leadership program. Knowing very little about it, Tasha signs up because it offers five high school credits that can help her graduate.She arrives on Monday night at Kamp Kiwanis for the four day onsite portion of the program along with 65 other students from Alberta high schools. She has never been away from home overnight before and it feels far too overwhelming meeting these other students from many different backgrounds and communities. She is really missing her family and wants to go home.Tasha finally decides to stay, but on the second day, a comment about land claims from someone upsets her because she felt it was a discriminatory statement about Indigenous people.Tasha finds the courage to speak up even though she really just wants to leave and go home. On expressing her concern to Tim, the individual responsible for the statement, he immediately apologizes. Through their discussion, he explains what he had really meant to say and offers to apologize to the whole group for the unintentionally hurtful comment. Tasha agrees to stay one more day. After that group apology, Tasha is feeling heard and a little more confidant. During that day, there are two presenters that have an immediate impact on her. Alison shares ways to find and see the positive attributes that we each have and Tasha is surprised to hear from her group members about some of the strengths that they see in her. Later she hears Cory speak from the heart about living with a physical disability, Cerebral Palsy. The messages from these two sessions resonate and are a turning point for Tasha, who is so grateful that she stayed until the last day.Tasha returns to her school with a new confidence and purpose. With her fellow students, she feels empowered to create a Be the Change project to teach others about Blackfoot culture. Connecting with neighbouring schools in Strathmore, they do their first tipi building workshop with Grade 3 students. That school is so thrilled with the impact on their students, they want Tasha and her group to return to do it again next year. Meanwhile the word spreads and another school asks them to do the same workshop with their Grade 4 students! Inspired by the experience, Tasha is an amazing example of a young person taking action in her community to create understanding and change.This is only one story of hundreds from Alberta high school students, who are inspired to take action in their communities to create change.","SEEDS Connections empowers youth to create positive change by providing educational programs which engage Canadian students in experiential learning opportunities in the areas of diversity, environment, energy, and leadership.Our programs have involved over 40,000 students, who have completed over 50,000 environmental and diversity projects, and impacted audiences of more than 75,000, since 2011.

These two generations came together meeting at school on a weekly basis. Special friendships unlike no other developed extending to the family. Every week during school hours throughout the school year, these groups met for one hour to do something that was special to them.

"220",465,"Servants Anonymous Society of Calgary","Today, I look in the mirror and I see a beautiful, confident, young, woman who loves herself, and has so much strength.It didnt start that way. When I first arrived in Calgary, I attended the funeral for my sons father. This man had arranged for my release while I was held captive by a gang, where I had suffered years of unspeakable abuse while locked in a camper. He managed to negotiate my freedom. His sudden death in a motorcycle accident was devastating, and my whole grieving process (and so much more) happened with my new sisters.One of the most important things to me was knowing that nobody knew where I was, and that I was safe. In the classroom, there was so much that needed to come out so I could heal. Not just grief for my sons father, the remaining trauma from my experience with the gang, and all the pain that comes with years of addiction. There was also the very first monumental abuse that changed the trajectory of my life when I was 14 years old. Thats when a 29 year old drug dealer confined me, sexually assaulted me, and coerced me into smoking crystal meth. Thats how my life became about feeding an addiction.To open up about all that with the girls and women in class was really hard. But I looked around and saw that I wasnt the only one that was exploited. I wasnt alone. I initially came to here because I was told they could help me get my son back after he was apprehended. I got that, and so much more. Sharing built a sisterhood between us. The love that comes from this community is unbelievable. I got my life back. They gave me my son back.There are no words to explain the gratitude I have for this program. I am now 30 years old, and have two years of continuous sobriety.That is the Strength of Sisterhood.","Our Participants are Mothers, Daughters, Sisters and Friends. They deserve the opportunity to rebuild their lives. Each of them has, or has been at risk of being sexually exploited.SAS provides a continuum of supportive services for women and their children that are exiting from dangerous and violent situations. This can be escaping from a gang where a woman was held captive, or a woman fleeing a dangerous partner who was attempting to sell her.Our Life-Skills Program is a comprehensive trauma-informed recovery- oriented program that ensures women and their children continue to be safe from exploitation and violence. Women are supported in their journey of recovery through peer support, a life skills curriculum, case management, trauma counseling and on-site child-care. 2-stages of safe and supportive housing are provided in our housing model.Graduates of the Life-Skills program then transition into the Follow-Care program.

Together, they created the Corner Club; a group of women who taught each other through cooking, making crafts, by writing and publishing their stories in Cry of the Streets, and by helping other young women at risk.Before the onsite training opportunities were available at SAS through our social enterprise business (Fireworks Co-operative) many young women faced challenges in finding employment and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Today, the elements of our Follow-Care support and Work Experience in Fireworks Co-operative, as well as our other business units within SAS, increases each womans confidence and our combined efforts make a difference in this unique relationship-and-professional business setting.Social Enterprise - Venue1008:Venue1008, a Fireworks Co-operative, is located in trendy Inglewood and the social enterprise for SAS.

"221",498,"Shock Trauma Air Rescue Service Foundation (STARS)","In the early 1980s, studies showed about half the deaths due to trauma could have been prevented if patients had received critical care sooner. When Dr. Greg Powell lost a young mother who was being transported from a rural area to Calgary by ground ambulance, he decided something had to change. Thats when he founded STARS.Less than half the population of Western Canada lives in major urban centres and has access to critical care within minutes. For the other half such access is measured in hours. That can mean the difference between life and death; full recovery or permanent damage.With STARS, those living in rural communities, working in remote areas, travelling on highways or being transported from community hospitals to major medical centres, receive the very best in critical care in helicopters staffed and outfitted as mobile ICUs.WHY FLY?The more quickly a patient receives treatment, the much better their recovery.Timely treatment of stroke, heart attacks or brain injuries can save more than $1 million per patient.The economic benefits of helicopter ambulance missions are six times higher than the costs.Patients transported by helicopter ambulance are more likely to survive than those transported by ground ambulance, even though they are more severely injured.","Our vision is saving lives through partnership, innovation and leadership. Our mission is to provide a safe, rapid, highly specialized emergency medical transport system for the critically ill and injured. The STARS vision and mission are supported by four pillars of activity:Emergency medical communications  finding the patientPatient care and transport  caring for the patientEducation and research  educating the providersFundraising  community partnerships  raising funds and working within the communitySTARS core values are safety, teamwork, accountability, respect and spirit.Since 1985, STARS has flown more than 27,000 missions from six bases in Calgary, Edmonton, Grande Prairie, Regina, Saskatoon and Winnipeg. To see how many times STARS flew to your community in the past year, please visit our Mission Record: http://www.stars.ca/ab/what-we-do/mission-recordSTARS Recent Results: In 2014-15, STARS flew 3,084 missions, carrying only critically ill or injured patients. Since 1985, more than 30,000 missions have been carried out.STARS Strategic Directions for 2013-2018:World-class critical care.Were focused on continuous improvement of the clinical care we provide to our patients, and were also focused on demonstrating our clinical expertise and the value STARS brings to the health-care system.Innovate for sustainability. Our goal is to ensure we are nimble and adaptable to the changing dynamic of government funding and partnerships. We also aim to ensure our value proposition and competitive advantage is strong and visible to all of our stakeholders.STARS Foundation - the next generation. Our current challenge is to make sure our fundraising arm is positioned to meet our funding needs into the future. Our goal is about re-imagining the STARS Foundation without losing the grassroots relevance that has been so vital to our success.More on our strategic directions can be found in our Financial Report: 2013-2014.","STARS is a charitable, non-profit organization, and the STARS Foundation is the fundraising arm of the organization. Funding is met through donations received from individuals, service groups, business and corporations, municipalities, and through collaborative agreements with provincial governments.Our nurses and paramedics are experienced, typically with at least five years professional background in hospitals or ambulance services, before joining us. Those selected to join must then successfully complete a comprehensive and intensive 10-week induction training program that exceeds 200 hours of instruction before they can accept their first mission. After that, a minimum of 96 hours of ongoing specialized air ambulance and critical care training is required annually for as long as they work for STARS.Becoming a STARS transport physician doesnt come easy either. Our doctors come from backgrounds that include specialty level emergency medicine and other critical care fields. Like our nurses and paramedics, STARS transport physicians work in the local community and must meet ongoing training requirements.On board, patients are always cared for by a STARS flight nurse and flight paramedic team. A transport physician accompanies the patient when required, about 20 per cent of the time. Otherwise, they are always available for consultation through telephone or radio link.The incredible ongoing support of the community helps us continually enhance our innovative and leading-edge air medical programs and service.Approximately 25per cent of STARS total mission costs is funded by Alberta Health Services and the remaining 75per cent comes from fundraising and community partnerships. STARS total operating expenses per base is approximately $10 million a year.STARS also facilitates a critical care transport medicine education program for all air medical personnel (fixed wing and rotary) in the province. This provides consistent training and equitable education opportunities. STARS also coordinates the movement of critically ill patients from rural hospitals to larger centres.","We are committed to delivering the most appropriate emergency medical care to critically ill or injured patients in the timeliest way possible. Our programs and services are possible because of generous support from individuals, corporations, businesses, governments, and many other sources.Each STARS program has been built with the goal of enhancing patient care. This has been the main driving force behind STARS since we first began in 1985. The tremendous ongoing support of the community helps us continually enhance our innovative and leading-edge medical programs.In addition to providing patient care and transport, our diversified support allows STARS to offer value-added programs as part of our services. This includes emergency medical communications through the STARS Emergency Link Centre as well as educational and research resources that include the STARS Mobile Simulation program and the STARS Operational Outreach Program.The partnerships we have formed with other emergency medical service providers, businesses, and service clubs strengthen our ability to meet our vision of saving lives.Whether you make a donation, buy a STARS Calendar or Lottery ticket, or volunteer your time, you help make a difference.

"223",680,"Soccer Without Boundaries","For a child moving to a new country with a new culture and a new language, soccer offers something familiar where they know the rules and how to play. As Jean Claude Munyezamu knows from experience on the soccer field it doesnt matter where you come from and, for a while, you can forget what you left behind.Jean-Claude Munyezamu is a Rwandan Canadian who escaped the genocide in 1994 and volunteered in refugee camps in Somalia and Sudan before moving to Canada in 1998. When Jean-Claude moved to Calgary he continued to volunteer with places like The Mustard Seed so that he would meet people and continue to improve his English. Jean-Claude says that he feels that Calgary has adopted him and that he wants to do what he can to help others who are new to the city. He knows what its like to have to leave your home and culture and everything that is familiar to you. When he saw children in his neighbourhood struggling to fit in and falling through the cracks he knew he had to do something.Read more about Jean-Claude.In 2010, after attending a Glenbrook community meeting concerning youth crime, Jean Claude Munyezamu started a free grassroots soccer program for immigrant and low income children. Today, boys and girls of every age, skill level and culture participate every week in the program that now runs year-round, indoor and outdoor. Participants come from Syria, Afghanistan, Lebanon, Somalia, Sudan, Rwanda, Korea, China, The Philippines, Uruguay, Colombia, Congo and more. Many came to Canada as refugees. Some of the children who participated when the program began have returned as volunteer coaches. This leadership experience has helped some get their first job or move on to higher education.Immigrant parents are being introduced to other families in their neighborhood, whom they can rely on for support and information pertaining to their new lives in Calgary. Furthermore, parents in the local soccer association, Calglen, have embraced these families into their club, offering rides, developing friendships on the soccer fields and sharing used equipment of their own. Older players have gained work experience as volunteer coaches, using this as a step towards an entry level job or higher education.-----Like many Canadian urban centers, Calgary has seen tremendous growth as many immigrant and refugee families move to the city. With minimal language skills and hard working parents, the children and teens in this community need the support of a program like Soccer Without Boundaries (SWB) to facilitate their transition and provide a safe, athletic program to occupy their time.","Our primary goal is to provide an outreach program that engages youth to participate in soccer as a means to integrate immigrant and low income children into their new community. Last summer SWB offered a free summer soccer program in a local greenspace. Nearly 100 children participated, representing 19 different countries and with ages ranging from pre-school to high school. This camp offered an affordable, safe environment for children with working parents but was not financially viable for a volunteer based organization.Last summer, SWB sought to expand our programs and made plans to hold a Summer Camp in August (August 8-12, 2016). A Soul of the City grant from the Calgary Foundation was made to help establish the camp as a sustainable annual enterprise.This new Summer Camp was designed to provide a supportive environment for children of new Canadians to help them become accustomed to their new home. This opportunity gave working parents, some from single parent families, an affordable and safe week of summer camp for their children. By the end of the week, the children improved their soccer skills and made new friends. We observed that the kids, and their parents, developed a feeling of belonging in their new country and especially in their new neighbourhood.----Jean-Claudes original grassroots volunteer group has grown into an innovative multicultural outreach program aimed at integrating new Canadians into their community. SWB is designed to bring communities together, break down barriers and let children feel that they belong. It allows them to build self-esteem, develop leadership skills and strengthen social relationships through team work, fair play, and conflict resolution. It also provides their parents and families with a means to volunteer, meet their neighbours and get involved in their community.If you were to ask Jean-Claude about SWBs accomplishments this year, this is his response:It was really good to see so many of the kids who were previous participants in our club and camps serving as small group leaders at our Summer Camp this year. This year we had 21. A number of our previous participants also obtained jobs with recommendations from us.Also it was good to see both Daniella and Moneer receiving special recognition for their soccer skills.I was proud of our kids who shared their personal immigration stories during this years Janes Walks.If you were to ask Jean-Claude about SWB highlights from 2016, this is his response:It was an encouraging year in that SWB was able to take over all expenses for the club and Summer Camp thanks to generous donors. People generously donated shoes, socks and shin guards for those who couldnt afford to buy their own. We had some very appreciative parents who even expressed an interest in volunteering at next years camp. The soccer match with the Calgary Police team was a highlight for many. We have also had more parents volunteering at our weekly Saturday Soccer Club.Saturday Soccer Club: We had anywhere from 12 kids on a rainy day (indoors) to 40-45 kids playing at our field in the Summer. We draw from a group of over 80 regular participants.Soccer Camp: We had 113 kids finish out the week at camp this year.","Soccer Camp (August 8-12, 2016): Last summer, we secured four paid soccer coaches supported by volunteer coaches (some of whom were youth volunteers who attended SWB) to help the children work on their soccer skills and support them on and off the field. At the end of the week each child returned home with a participation kit, including a soccer ball, a water bottle, a jersey and hopefully a new sense of belonging. Our Soccer Camp week ended with a barbeque for all the participants, coaches, volunteers and parents (about 400 people showed).Soccer Camp (August 21-25, 2017): This years soccer camp will revolve around a celebration of Canadas 150th Birthday. Special speakers will share stories of hardships endured by immigrants to Canada over the last 150 years, highlighting the opportunities that drew them here. Insights will also be shared about those aboriginals who called Alberta home before the Prairie Immigration Boom began in 1867.Saturday Soccer Program (weekly): Weve held regular Saturday soccer programs where many of the summer camp attendees were among these children. We advertised through local churches, community associations and established personal networks in order to ensure as many children as possible were able to attend. SWB connected with organizations supporting recent Syrian immigrant familes, some of whom have been in contact with these organizations.-------If people are wondering about our future plans, heres where were going:     Our most immediate plans are for an after school tutoring program which includes Electives 4 Kids (visual arts and music). As we grow we intend to offer multiple camps around the city. If we could obtain a suitable facility we would also like to offer affordable day care to the Calgary housing community.","In April 2016, Soccer Without Boundaries was awarded a$10,000 Soul of the City grant, voted by the community and provided by theCalgary Foundation,Calgary Economic Development, andRBC Foundation. This grant was used to help fund the cost of a one-week summer soccer camp that took place in the summer of 2016.Children can understand soccer even if they dont understand the local language and culture. They know the basic rules of the games and they soon start to learn, or re-learn, structure, authority and consequences. Most of the time kids from refugee camps dont like rules, but they respect soccer rules. -Jean-Claude Munyezamu, 2016Soccer is a universal language.After thousands of hours of volunteer time, SWB now needs to establish a formal structure and properly fund our annual summer camps and year-round weekly soccer programs with the goal of expanding into more communities.Every child deserves to feel safe from harm, to have fun, to feel that they belong, and to start their new life on a level playing field. -Jean-Claude Munyezamu, 2016We are asking for your generous support and sponsorship of Soccer Without Boundaries. Charitable receipts are issued for all donations over $20. You can donate by clicking here.On-going sponsorship opportunitiesA year of weekly soccer for one child: $500 per child- we offer weekly Saturday soccer in two communities in Calgary. Over 100 children participate in the two locations, Glenbrook (SW) and Vista Heights (NE).One week of soccer camp: $275 per child- this supports one child for a full week of camp, including coaching, take home jersey and soccer ball, snacks, a celebration BBQ, and overhead costs (administration, insurance, etc.)Any amount of your choice- any donationamountis welcome!What do we need?We need regular paid staff to administrate theSaturdayClub, the Summer Camps (we want to expand) and our after school tutoring program. If we expand to offering multiple camps and the after school program we will also need more volunteers. We definitely need funding for our rentals, camps and future programs. A facility within walking distance of the Glenbrook housing complex (or a van/bus to transport them to a facility) would allow us to expand to offer programming to meet other needs ie. ESL, alternative sports programs, healthy eating coursesAs soon as we have the funding to buy curriculum for our tutoring program and obtain the musical instruments we need, we will open the doors to our after school program.Loneliness is one of the greatest challenges for new Canadians. They can often live in Canada ten years before making their first Canadian friend. By serving immigrant kids in a volunteer capacity Calgarians can connect with their families and make adjusting to a new life bearable. Our call to action would be:To reach out to a newcomer by serving those most important to them - their children.","http://www.soccerwithoutboundaries.org/","Jeanclaude@soccerwithoutboundaries.org","822300596RR0001","403.618.0457","Jean Claude Munyezamu","34350","kid sport camp summer",223,0.0201583873290137,0.0590352771778258,0.00935925125989921,0.0719942404607632,0.0115190784737221,0.0287976961843053,0.0935925125989921,0.39812814974802,0.0266378689704824,0.05471562275018,0.0223182145428366,0.0223182145428366,0.0374370050395968,0.0179985601151908,0.125989920806336
"224",725,"Society for Treatment of Autism ","In 1972, a group of parents appealed to then Premier Peter Lougheed, to build a residential facility for children with autism. As a result, a side by side duplex was purchased next to the original Alberta Childrens Hospital in S.W. Calgary. Following renovations, the facility opened in 1973, with 6 children being accepted into the program from the Psychiatric and Education Centre at the hospital. It was named Margaret House in honour of Dr. Margaret Horne, who worked with the children and families at that time.Since then, the Society for Treatment of Autism (STA) has grown to provide comprehensive treatment, education and consulting services for individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD).","Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex developmental disability that impactsing developing children. Individuals with ASD have significant social interaction and communication challenges and tend to display restricted, repetitive behaviours. Symptom expression can range from mild or subtle to severe and obvious. It is for this reason that Autism is considered a Spectrum Disorder.Research suggests ASD is rooted in early brain development and that symptoms/characteristics tend to emerge before the childs third birthday. A number of factors that negatively impact brain development have been linked to ASD (e.g., genetics, neuropathology, metabolic conditions, etc.).Programsand our Treatment PhilosophyWe are unique in that our programs focus specifically on meeting the needs of children, youth and adults with ASD and their families, regardless of age, functioning level or behavioral presentation. We provide a range of services that are individualized to meet needs across the life span through programs that are designed to maximize each individuals potential.Individual programs focus on skill development within a variety of functional areas, including Behaviour, Communication, Socialization, Play/Recreation/Vocational, Foundation Skills/School Readiness, Self Help/Adaptive Functioning.Individuals enrolled in one of our programs may receive consultation from members of our multidisciplinary team, including:Psychologists/Provisional Psychologists/Behavioural ConsultantsSpeech-Language PathologistsOccupational TherapistsTeachersSocial WorkersResearchSince 2010, STA has been conducting small-scale clinical research to measure treatment fidelity (the degree to which a treatment is implemented as intended) for the CBO early intervention program. Before treatement, goals are individually determined for each child, pathways to achieve the goals are standardized and are monitored using these treatment fidelity checks. Our most recent quarterly check indicated the CBO Early Intervention Program had 96% fidelity, well above the recommended minimum of 80%!The majority of research investigations to date have involved social-communication outcomes from our CBO Early Intervention Program and personal and vocational training program outcomes for adolescents and adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder from our Adult and Adolescent: Pursuits and Recruits programs. Results from these studies and evaluations have been presented at a variety of national and international conferences and conventions.Potential areas for future research may include:Effective use of visual supports to develop language in preschoolersEffectiveness of mealtime supports to increase food tolerance and/or repertoire in preschoolersEffectiveness of transdisciplinary treatment in managing challenging behaviours in older children and adolescents with Autism Spectrum DisorderParent and professional perspectives related to transdisciplinary versus multidisciplinary treatment","Our Services- Weoperate a range of programs in and around the city of Calgary. These programs are designed to meet the needs of people with Autism Spectrum Disorders:Community Based Options - Early Intervention Programs(404 - 94th Ave SE Calgary, AB 403-253-2291)Combined Specialized Services and Program Unity Funding (PUF) ProgramOffers an individualized program for children 2.5 to 6 years of age, who are approved for both Specialized Services funding (via Family Supports for Children with Disabilities) and Program Unit Funding (via Alberta Education). Individualized programming is provided in the childs home, community (e.g., outings, recreation programs, preschools, Kindergarten) and within a specialized classroom environment onsite at STA; with focus on the individual learning needs of the children and their families. This program runs twelve months a yaer, 30 hours per week.Specialized Services ONLY ProgramOffers individual programs for children less than 3 years who are approved for Specialized Services funding via Family Support for Children with Disabilities and do not qualify (due to their age) for a PUF program, Individualized Programming is provided in the childs home, and community.

Treatment programming is individualized and implemented by Behaviour Therapists. Each child must participate in some type of day program, which typically entails attending school in the community, in order to enter and remainin the Residential Program. Integration with peers is actively promoted through participation in a wide variety of community sports and leisure activities. Our summer daycamp program is available to residential children during the school summer break period.Therapeutic AftercareThe Therapeutic Aftercare program offers afterschol and/or weekend treatment for children/youth. Depending on needs, services are provided in the family home and /or at the residential facility.Pursuits/Recruits - Adolescent and Adult Services (Ability Hub (3rd Floor) 3820 - 24th Ave NW Calgary, AB 403-210-5000)Pursuits programs focus on increasing personal independence, developing early vocational and job skills, and preparation for the post secondary envivironment. Most of the programs are hosted on site at the Ability Hub, 3rd floor, Child Development Centre, 3820 - 24 Ave. NW with the exception of the Volunteerfor Life program, which takes place at businesses in the community.Recruits programs are designed to provide individuals with supported work experience at a variety of community locations.

To be eligible for any of these community placements, the individual must have attended and completed at least one Pursuits program previously.Community Education and Consultative Services (404 - 94th Ave SE Calgary, AB 403-253-2291)Society for Treatment of Autism offers a variety of services in addition to our programs. Consultative services are resource dependent and may be available upon request.","While we would like to be able to treat more children, our service capacity is dictated by funding. In this regard, the Government of Alberta has stepped up to ensure that individuals with ASD in the province receive the best treatment services possible.However, we rely on community support to continue to grow and develop our services.With the help of a very supportive community of partners and donors, we have created and sustained successful treatment and educational services over the year. The creation of every one of our programs was lead by community requests in response to changing needs and we are continually growing.Our future expansion plans:an intensive small group residentialtreatment program for highneed adolescents and young adultsa small group residential transition program for individuals ready to move into less intensive community environmentsWays you can support STA:Work with usWe are always looking for new team members.

"225",92,"Sonshine Society of Christian Community Services","Motivated by our Christian faith, Sonshine Community Services exists to help women and children transform their lives. We dream of a community where women and children live safely in healthy families.Sadly, shelter for women and children fleeing domestic violence is a deep need in our city. Each year Sonshine Centre becomes home for approximately 40 families, the overwhelming majority of whom are considered at high risk for fatality or serious injury due to violence in the home. Would it surprise you to know that over half of residents in a womens shelter are children? Over the past three decades, Sonshine has seen the alarming impacts of domestic violence on children and its significant negative effects on a childs emotional, social and cognitive wellbeing. In fact, witnessing or experiencing domestic violence is the number one indicator that a child will grow up to be a victim or perpetrator of violence. Not only does Sonshine help end family violence right now, we place special emphasis on the children in our care in order to cut off the cycle of violence before it impacts future generations.In many circumstances, the 21 days offered at womens or family emergency shelters is simply not enough time for a woman to gather the resources she needs to ensure she and her children can live safely and independently. Surveys by the Alberta Council of Womens Shelters found women return to abusive partners because of poor economic circumstances and lack of housing. This is why Sonshine offers an 18 month program, to support women through the healing process and equip them with life skills and/or job-specific training in order to become financially stable and capable of maintaining appropriate housing. Most importantly, women leave Sonshine empowered to create safe, healthy, loving environments for themselves and their children.To learn more about how we make a difference, please click on this link: Our Success Stories.","Sonshine Community Services has been serving the local Calgary community since 1978 by providing care, support, housing and counselling to families and individuals in need. Our story is best shared through the eyes of the people we serve:Thanks to the security, surveillance cameras, and safety plans put in place for us, I feel very safe atSonshine. I feel supported by my counselor, and no longer feel alone. Being at Sonshine has given me the opportunity to make friends and gain confidence, freedom and strength. Im learning to enjoy life with my daughter. Im grateful for the new skills I have been able to learn and the community resources I am becoming aware of through the help of Sonshine.My daughter is now able to make eye contact with others, is very happy and able to have fun.She is doing so well in school and has been able to be focused on studying and has become more responsible with her studies... I now know I can make it and build a better future for my daughter and me. I dont have enough words to say how very thankful I am to Sonshine.Past ResidentSonshine second stage shelter gave me the chance to take my life back. By the time I came to Sonshine, my children were grown, however, they needed me to show them how to break the cycle of abuse. Coming from a family life full of domestic violence, I noticed the cycle of abuse carrying on generation after generation. Shelters like Sonshine will help not just help the generation in front of them but families in the future. Past Resident","Over the years, Sonshines services have evolved into a full range of residential and outreach programs specializing in developing healthy families and helping families impacted by violence. To that end, Sonshine Community Counseling exists to fortify individuals and prevent family break downs. Since 1985, Sonshine Family Day Homes (accredited in 2005) has enabled children to participate to their fullest potential in day home routines, activities and play experiences. Sonshine Community Services operates Sonshine Centre, a second stage shelter serving women and children who are escaping family violence and abuse. The Centre is an integral part of Calgarys collaborative response to domestic violence, housing women and children who are at a high risk for serious injury or fatality, and providing the support needed to navigate the practical and emotional complexities of leaving an abusive home. With 24 units, Sonshines shelter provides a one-year residential program for women and women with children, followed by a six-month program for safely transitioning back into the community. In 2014, the Sonshine Childrens Centre will open, offering specialized child care for children from Sonshines shelter, other shelters and the greater community who have experienced domestic violence. It will be Canadas first child care facility located in a shelter that integrates therapeutic programming and interventions with child development strategies designed to end the inter-generational cycle of family violence.","OUR WISH LIST| The following are some immediate and ongoing needs we would love your help with.

"226",570,"Soup Sisters and Broth Brothers Society","Sharon Hapton a life-long nurturer and soup-maker, always believed that two of societys most prevalent issues, domestic abuse and youth homelessness would benefit from the care and warmth that comes in a bowl of soup. She launched in Calgary in 2009 and made her vision a reality. Today Soup Sisters operates in 21 Cities across Canada. Over 40,000 participants have ensured delivery of 750,000 servings of nurturing and nourishing soup.A powerful message that says we care is being delivered each month to over 40 emergency shelters and youth shelters from coast to coast. The Soup Sisters hug in a bowl prepared from the hearts and hands of Soup Sisters and Broth Brothers across Canada makes Soup Sisters a leader in awareness and advocacy on the issues of domestic abuse and youth homelessness.The Soup Sisters hug in a bowl prepared from the hearts and hands of Soup Sisters and Broth Brothers across Canada makes Soup Sisters a leader in awareness and advocacy on the issues of domestic abuse and youth homelessness","An innovative social enterprise, Soup Sisters is 100% volunteer driven at the event level. What makes us clearly unique is that there is no other organization that reaches women and children in crisis at the ground level with the simple virtue of kindness. While many organizations support shelters with much needed funding these funds often times go unnoticed by the very demographic we are all striving to assist. Not only do our monthly donations of soup decreases the operating costs of the Shelters we support by 18-20% thereby allowing these funds to be put back into much needed programming and support services, it is important to note that the shelters often attest that our soups provide self-esteem to shelter residents at this time of crisis in their live where they believe that no one cares. The message that comes with the soup is hugely impactful and a testament to a caring community.I have been working in the anti-violence sector for many years and the abuse often presents the same in that the women are told by their abusers that they are worth nothing. Soup Sisters is not just about the soup. It is more than caring, it is about saving lives when people start believing that they are worthy of life free of fear and that they are not dumb, stupid and ugly. So while Soup-makers pay, chop, cook and write, we hand the soup to the women and tell them someone paid to make this for you because they care about you  know that you have changed a life. NATIONAL RESULTS:According to the Canadian Institute of Health Research, almost 1.7 million households (13%) experienced some level of food insecurity. This food insecurity affects one in six children across Canada. According to food insecurity policy research, Canada does not have any coordinated governmental policies or programs designated to address this. During our history, we have:provided 750,000 servings of soup to women, children and youth in crisis;produced soup for local shelters at over 21 cities across Canada and the United States;partnered withover 30 residential sheltersto provide residents with delicious soup;in 2015, arranged for 468 soup making events that has resulted in a network of 40,000 soup sisters and broth brothers.SOUP RECIPIENTS inCALGARY:When some citizens participate in our soup making, they are supporting the women and children at theCalgary Womens Emergency ShelterandAwo Taan Healing Lodge.We knew of deserving young people on the path toward believing in themselves and imagining new possibilities. With this, some participants helped to supportThe Doorway.Soup Sisters Blue Flame in Calgary has a beautiful, intimate kitchen space at the ATCO Blue Flame and has, in its history, helped to support theYWCA Mary Dover House;Nearlyhalf a million women, children and youthhave been supported by us in the last 8 years through our ongoing events and special events such as The Big Stir.​KEY MILESTONES:Soup for Syrians: Our way of welcoming Syrian Refuges to our City was with the Gift of Soup! Earlier this year, we provided 10,000+ servings of soup in Calgary and Ottawa to welcome Syrian refugees to Canada prepared from the hearts and hands of local Soup Sisters and Broth Brothers.Our first bestselling cookbook came out in 2012, followed by a second edition in 2014, and our next cookbookSouper Kidswill be available in Fall 2017. All of our books published by Random House have been a source of income towards our operations.AWARDS:Soup Sisters Founder Sharon Hapton was awarded the Meritorious Service Award by the Governor General last March 2016. The Meritorious Service Decorations were created by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II to recognize an individual for a remarkable achievement accomplished over a limited period of time. See link:Meritorious Service MedalSharon Hapton also received the Global Television and YWCA Women of Vision award in February 2011 and was honoured nationally by Chatelaine Magazine as Everyday Hero and Woman of the Year. Most recently she was profiled as Global Televisions Everyday Hero and her soup social enterprise was featured in Women of Influence Magazine.","The concept is simple. Soup Sisters are year-round programs where each participant pays a $55 registration fee to join in a soup-making event at a local professional kitchen under the guidance of a chef facilitator. Each event produces approximately 150-200 servings of nourishing soup that are delivered fresh to a local shelter almost immediately. Events are social evenings with lively conversation, chopping, laughter and warm kitchen camaraderie that culminate in a simple, sit-down supper of soup, salad, bread and wine for all participants. Soup Sisters collaborates with cooking schools, restaurants, golf courses, and hotels eliminating the need for our own kitchen facility.

But you provide more than a listening ear, you provide suggestions and encouragement. Im now trying to pay it forward by helping new people in my community. -Client testimonial from the SWCRC Client Satisfaction Survey, 2013We exist to improve the quality of life for local residents in 28 communities south of Glenmore Drive. Each year we help over a thousand vulnerable individuals and families find the resources they require, provide them with information, and support community opportunities that connect people to each other. We believe that children, youth and adults of every age and background deserve to live decent and fulfilling lives in a community that cares about their neighbours. This means we concern ourselves with the individual, the family and the community connections.The SWCRC opened our doors in 2003 in an attempt to offer wayfinding support closer to where people lived, where individuals could find welcoming and responsive service navigation, access to basic needs, resident led initiatives and we began to learn and understand the local needs. For fourteen years we have supported thousands of vulnerable individuals and families develop the skills and reslilience to provide a positive, stable and supportive home and connected them to resources and social supports closer to where they live.Our work is never done in isolation and we know that to have the greatest impact, we must work closely with other community partners to create a warm and welcoming environment, build trusting relationships and reduce the barriers to access. We engage many local volunteers to provide extra hands and hearts and be the voice of the community. Together we can build resilient individuals, create healthy families and supportive south west communities.","The SWCRC supports vulnerable families who live in south Calgary. Most of the clients who visit us lead complex lives and have experienced many challenges which may include insufficient income to consistently meet their familys basic needs. Low-income individuals and families often present with a myriad of issues such as precarious housing, unemployment and underemployment; addictions and mental health concerns, domestic violence; parent-child conflict; depression and social isolation. At the SWCRC we can provide both direct client support to help them now, and offer long term solutions through prevention programs designed to build on their capacity, knowledge and resources.We are considered a community hub that provides a one stop shop for a variety of programs and services. We value and respect different cultures, traditions and beliefs and we encourage individual independence and self-determination. We provide resource information, referral, supportive counselling, parenting education, speakers and workshops on issues impacting the community (example: employment and life skills, stress management, budgeting, and literacy programs). We work to decrease key risk factors that contribute to family instability.2015-2016 Highlights:Our Burger and Beer Social was a success and raised more than $7,400.00 for community programsand initiatives;With a new Executive Director, weve put a stronger focus on providing prevention and early intervention programs and services to families and new immigrants;We launched the Positive Discipline Program, aneducational program for parents to provide them with skills, a strong social network, andtools to assist with parenting.","The SouthWest Communities Resource Centre provides high quality programs and services grounded by best-practices and measurable outcomes.

We devise opportunities for contemporary performance and dance, locally and nationally, by removing boundaries between it and other performance genres. Our company produces and presents dance and physical contemporary creation for stage and screen and site-specific locals. Enthralled with new ways of viewing contemporary life, Springboards programming, creative residencies, workshops, discussions, performances and creative happenings prompts artists and audiences to risk, learn, create and connect.","In 2003 Nicole Mion took over as artistic director and was in the vanguard of the companys redevelopment by creating the international Fluid Movement Arts Festival, as well as installing the multi-disciplined platform Interrarium Creation residency for professional artists at the Banff Centre for the Arts, and spearheading the build of containR the pop up arts and community placemaking installation made from recycled shipping containers.Under Springboards flag, Nicole Mion produces and choreographs for stage and screen where she integrates dance, theatre, new media and all manner of installations.Every October Springboard presents The Fluid Movement Arts Festival where Calgary audiences can see the best of contemporary dance and physical performances featuring a line-up of international, national and local artists. Our pop up arts venue, containR, was introduced by Springboard in 2009 to feature Alberta at the Vancouver Winter Olympics.We launched the first Calgary installation of containR in 2012 for the citys yearlong celebration as the arts capital of Canada. We showcased containR during our festival and then in 2013 we moved containR to Sunnyside where it is today and where it is designated the first art park in Calgary. With our many partners we are enriching the urban landscape through creative placemaking. At containR we champion a 100-mile diet of creative ideas that forges links to artists, all arts mediums and audiences, community building and green initiatives. Artists and citizens mix like molecules, forming a porous exchange of interaction and innovation, brewing unexpected creative results.","Springboard Performance curates the Fluid Movement Arts Festival, as well as all activities at containR and the Interrarium residency in Banff. With our small staff we champion and create first-rate innovative opportunities for art and its exchange.Our partnerships are critical for sharing ideas and resources, for giving performing arts lovers the best possible experience and building a better playhouse for all to enjoy. So it is a priority to develop committed, cross-disciplinary partnerships that act as an invaluable mid-wife for culture makers across all art forms. Over the years we have established partnerships with Alberta Ballet, Banff Centre for the Arts, EPCOR CENTRE for the performing Arts, EMMEDIA, Y Stage, Theatre Junction Grand, Dancers Studio West, One Yellow Rabbit and Decidedly Jazz Danceworks just to name a few.By installing containR in Sunnyside as a green arts and culture incubator year round we reach out to a broader base of collaborators and audiences.

Supporting The Fluid Movement Arts Festival and The Interrarium residency for creation in Banff, and the containR art park is an investment in Calgary. We love volunteers who contribute active enthusiasm for the arts through their help.We need operations funding to manage the volume of requests we are getting from Calgary arts groups, community groups and green initiatives to use the containR space. People want containR to be active through the winter as well as spring, summer and fall. Currently we do not have the manpower over winter.

"229",396,"Stardale Women's Group Inc.","Courtney, Shae, Brittany, and Laila represent the faces of the urban Aboriginal girls ages 10 to 17 years. They come to Stardale Aboriginal after school program through word of mouth from their community or a referral through a counselor, group home or the Justice system. Honouring the Girls Stories is a culturally sensitive, girl-focused empowerment programming for Aboriginal girls.We are told that the girl is shy. She has trouble fitting in and is not doing well at school. And with her shyness she has difficulties making friends. As the girl has been moved around from school to school and to various community settings because of her familys situation, she tends to gravitate to girls who seem to be like her. They call themselves the misfits. Sometimes these girls gather together and harass, manipulate and physically hurt other girls. Then there are the other girls who come to Stardale who really are shy. They have difficulty speaking up in situations; find problem solving a challenge and mistrust authority figures.Stardales programming Model forms the girls group that everybody fits in, where everybody has a voice with something to contribute. The group and peer-mentoring format is used to maintain a balance of sources of positive influence for the girls as we find positive role-modelling and mentorship is often lacking in the girls personal lives. In turn the girls exhibit more compassion and tolerance when supporting each other in the group.The positive changes in the girls are amazing to see! It is like watching a flower blossom open its petals gradually into a full bloom. The once shy or withdrawn girl is communicative and can be rather chatty. We often laugh and playfully tease stating do you remember when Courtney, Shae, Brittany, or Laila started the program? They are no longer withdrawn sulking or moody.The girls are enthusiastic to learn and stick with the classes in selfesteem, communication, relationships, boundaries, family dynamics, cooking, acting, health and wellness, nutrition, violence, abuse, and physical activities. They are eager to learn more about the Aboriginal culture and values, as well as womens roles. Additionally, the girls are thrilled to volunteer in the community. They are proud to help where they can. It gives them a tremendous sense of self-worth!Fifteen-year-old Natasha said shes nervous about her first modelling gig, but says the program has helped boost her self-confidence. Its really helped me out. Ive been more outgoing, she said.   SOURCE: Aboriginal all-girl gangs on the rise.  - By Jamie Komarnicki, Calgary HERALD, April 14, 2009","Our Mission is to provide life skills and literacy, as well as advocacy to women living in poverty and abusive situations, toward empowering their lives, and their families, and their communities, thus overcoming systemic barriers. For 18 years, weve designed and tested the Stardale Model for the enlightenment of females as a multidisciplinary approach to community development, culture, education, healing, social inclusion, prior learning, and social justice.Stardale takes a two world view and includes Aboriginal literacy which is a learnercentred approach to lifelong learning that honours the interconnectedness of all aspects of creation for personal empowerment, community development and selfdetermination. Aboriginal literacy encompasses first languages, elder involvement, culture and community in a holistic developmental approach to unify mind, heart, body and spirit.Mandate of Stardale:Introduce proactive interventions that empower Aboriginal girls to overcome systematic barriers and internalisation of lower standards of wellness, achievement, education, and employability by providing classroom educational opportunities as well as skills-training and strategies for healthy choice-making.Focus on preventative measures of addressing abuse and violence by following a holistic approach in training, thus allowing each participant to heal in her own time(s) and place(s).Foster cross-cultural exchange of health and social development issues with community partnershipsDevelop research and learning schemes in order to have a better informed view of the needs in the province.Share our programming strategy, and encourage others to begin the healing journeyProgram Activities embedded in the Stardale Model framework: Over the many years of service delivery, Stardale has initiated programming through group dynamics, whereby, the sharing has vastly similar experiences and realities.Incorporation of oral tradition  There was an abundance of art and stories, (contemporary and traditional)Incorporation of Aboriginal cultural traditions  The cultural aspect combined with the therapeutic processes made way for evolving programs such as the Talking Quilt and Sacred Weft, which correlated the experiences of women who had experienced the impacts of Residential Schools. The Stardale Sacred Weft Collection has been featured in an exhibit at the Glenbow Museum First Peoples for the past four years.Teaching Approach: Stardales programming format is multi-dimensional, but for the period of 2005 to the present it may be best understood by grouping healing strategies under two the broad, non-exclusive headings: the artistic and the communal. Art is employed as a healing tool in the program framework by adapting the womans sacred circles to work in harmony with the art, allowing an entire new dimension of [self-/ group- /ancestral-] awareness. It is a portal for the awakening of the young girls spirit. The art heals by freeing their creativity and expression, and resonating in their bodies, minds and spirits. When working within the group context, the healing becomes transpersonal. It connects one to another; it is an art of interconnection. The art may become ceremonial, environmental, performance or static. Whatever the art form is, the community becomes directly and indirectly involved. Stardale exploits the benefits of the support group and the mentorship relationship as educational tools, to enhance the girls development and to overcome self destructive behaviours.For the past ten years in Calgary and area, Stardale has worked with over six hundred Aboriginal girls, who are at-risk for experiencing violence, sexual exploitation and other destructive behaviours in their lives.Benchmarks:May 10, 2012 - Fashion Showcase in the lobby of the TransCanada building. Fashions were from Mealan, Hats from Zsa Zsa, hair and makeup from Delmar College.May 26, 2012 - Verb theatre group and Stardale partnered in the producing of the play Calgary 1000 Night, for the childrens festival, which was held at the Alberta Theatre Projects (ATP). This was first for an all Aboriginal girls to perform on a main stream stage in Calgary in a modern play.Oct 13, 2012- Alberta Health approaches Stardale to coordinate and present a fashion show at the culmination of a 2 day conference on Suicide Prevention for Aboriginal youth.May 13, 2013  The girls travelled by bus to Edmonton, whereby, they were the major entertainment in a conference entitled, Youth Suicide Awareness. The girls presented their play- Committing.August 21, 2013 - Girls were selected from Stardale to work together with the Westins professionals to select nutritious foods, prepare delicious dishes and enjoy the meal they have prepared together. Both CTV and Global TV interviewed and filmed the project.December 17, 2013 - the Calgary downtown Rotary held their annual Christmas luncheon at the Palliser hotel. The Stardale girls performed in a play My Best Christmas Ever was performed to an audience of 200 adults who responded with undivided attention, laughter and many loud applauses. Folded into the play for the Rotary were 2 songs, Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas and Santa Clause is coming to Town.Im so glad we were able to get you on the program and am also glad we were able to get the girls there. They really are delightful. I really commend you for the great work you are doing through Stardale. Its a terrific program and one can tell that you are really making a difference in the lives of these young ladies  Steve Allen past president of the Rotary, CEO Canadian Tourism Commission, Vice Chair of the Calgary Stampede Foundation.Awards and Recognition: Although not solicited, over the years Stardale has received recognition for its work. Most recently, these include:Awards of Distinction for Healthy Communities granted in 2013, one from the Ministry of Education and another from the Ministry of Health.The 2014 ECOS Local Hero Award for Communities and Sustainability under the Chinook awards category MPI International, Greater Calgary ChapterStardales Executive Director received the Government Albertas Inspiration award for Leadership in Prevention of Bullying","Priorities: Stardale has taken an approach to Aboriginal girls issues by giving credence to social constructs that can create a potential for harm. Such constructs have been the sexual exploitation of the girl/ child through the media, through the internet, through prostitution and more. We have identified and widened the scope to protect the vulnerable due to their age, poverty, and subjection. We have examined many of the activities that create, maintain or exploit the girl child. What does constitute a means of prevention and combats the sexual exploitation of the girl/child? The Stardale Womens Group has introduced social and cultural activities through a diversionary process which strengths resiliency and combats destructive behaviours. Stardale will continue to explore dynamic intersections of art and mentorship and to advocate for Aboriginal female youth by honouring our girls stories.Goal: To introduce an educational footprint for Aboriginal girls in Calgary and area that incorporates a preventative model of life skills and literacy that builds resiliency among the girls against exposure of destructive behaviours.-----The Stardale program is open to all Aboriginal girls aged 10-17 and targets those girls in particular who may be at-risk or at high-risk of destructive behaviour and/or whose families are financially vulnerable. The girls who come to Stardale are referred through various sources. I.E. school counsellors, teachers, social workers, agencies, and word of mouth. Also, we have referrals through visiting our website and word of mouth. All participants will be fully informed about the goals of the project. Girls will need to have consent given by a legal guardian, and this will be arranged before the program commencement. Stardale, in conjunction with each referral source, will facilitate the consent form completion process.The culturally-sensitive girl-focused content of the program engages girls in the areas of health and wellness, self-confidence, conflict resolution, constructive communication, emotional awareness, and risk-factors for destructive decision-making. The program builds on many unique experiences. This includes: fashion modelling  especially - as a tool for imparting skill sets in etiquette, poise, public speaking, personal hygiene, body awareness, and confidence while challenging the participants to discover a new lens for perceiving and engaging with fashion media. Then there is the dimension of performance art, which opens group discussions to the depths of abuse, violence, traumatic incident, suicide prevention, etc. Physical well-being, body awareness, and coordination are further emphasized in the classes on dance, hoola hooping and running.We offer classes in cooking at the Community kitchens facilities, which the girls truly enjoy! And then there are the out of door physical activities, from hiking at Edge worthy park and Johnson Canyon, snow shoeing in the Kananaskis, swimming at the North East Leisure Centre, horseback riding at Longview, and building camp fires for story telling sessions out in the bush.Volunteering: Not only does Stardale have a variety of dedicated and loyal women who volunteer with the girls. It is the girls too who are encouraged to volunteer within the community. It is giving back to the community that they feel a deep sense of purpose. The girls have volunteered at the Red and While club for the Minister of Indigenous Affairs  Len Webber, RBC  Stampede BQ on the Eight Ave mall, Clearstream for the Cochrane Rodeo, etc. They really enjoy getting out into the public and demonstrating their self-confidence.-----An Artistic Lens for advancing social change: It has been through the communication of creative innovation that Stardale continues to voice the needs of Aboriginal youth and the fostering of knowledge from what we learn in our processes of programming that we have developed and experienced.Committing - 2013 Aboriginal youth production on suicide awareness, tragedy and hope https://vimeo.com/66316504 -Edmonton presentation of the production CommittingAleshas Dream - 2014 Stardales collaboration with Alberta Ballet production with a modern and traditional story line of Aboriginal girls interpretation of suicide https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iw3RndSSBVQ - behind the scenes of the concept and collaboration of Alberta School of Ballet and StardaleCommitting Program: Honouring the Girls Stories 2015 another unique concept in a performance piece, based upon our knowledge acquired to date in outreaching to a broader spectrum of audiences in disseminating the story line of youth suicide and preventionAntidotal information:The Moms are much more involved in the program as well as supporting the girls in the program. When one 11 year old girl did not come to group, Stardale contacted the mother immediately. The mother attended and showed up to 3 other classes to make sure the girl was attending. We are finding that the girls are building better relationships with their mothers. I wish they had something think this when I was growing up on the rez, said one MotherI am so proud of these girls they have come a long way, said many of the MothersMy girl has confidence and likes to go to school, said the Mom of one 11 year old girl.At some of the celebrations when all the families attend we hear over and over again, how proud the parents are of what the girls are learning and demonstrating from attending the program.","We really need a program like this specifically for the girls. They are the forgotten ones.Nobody knows how to handle them  Community Elder Stardales focus is to give young Aboriginal girls a leg up in life! No more sliding through the cracks of the system. We want these girls lives to matter. We need your support to continue to make this a reality.I believe that by working with these youth, we will not only provide an immediate safe option for their lives during the time they choose to be in a dance environment, but also be able to provide them with enough tools and support through their natural interest in dance and fashion, so that we may find a way to gently transition them over the course of a year to a point where they could confidently participate in a mainstream dance or performing arts class of their choice. We can then take the lessons we have learned in working with these clients and share our experience with other non-profit arts and service groups working in related areas.

I was excited to be starting a job that assisted the Greater Forest Lawn Area, because this is where I have lived all my life, but even that didnt prepare me for the reality that people and families endure while they are living in poverty.Poverty in Calgary is real, despite our prosperity. Too many families have to choose between buying groceries or paying the rent. Too many individuals have to spend their time jumping through hoop after hoop to qualify for assistance that they are eligible for. And this is where Sunrise shines. As a Community Advocate, I am able to ensure that the basic needs of my clients are met, so they can stop worrying about how they will feed their children next, and focus on improving their skills instead. We help navigate the systems and advocate on behalf of people so disenfranchised that their voices are often ignored, or can go unnoticed.The clients that we assist are some of the strongest, most resilient people I have ever met. Many of them inherited poverty and circumstances that make it very difficult to get ahead, because so much of their time and resources are stretched thin by just trying to get by to the next day, or the next meal. Ive met mothers living on $1000 a month total while balancing going to school to improve their English and raising their children within a new culture, but still preserving their own. They are dealt challenge after challenge, but still manage to keep going, and do so with a smile, sometimes through the tears.I work with Sunrise, because I know there is a need in the communities, and because I know that the means are out there to meet them. I want to be a part of an agency that will make that happen.-Natalie A., Community Advocate","Sunrise was created in response to community concerns about social problems in Calgarys east side. In 1997, the Marlborough Social Concerns Network, the Sunrise Community Partnership, and the Family Violence Prevention Initiative, with the encouragement of Calgary and Area Child and Family Services, formed a working committee to address these concerns. There was broad agreement that a centre was needed in east Calgary to provide information dissemination, referrals to services, and more accessible programming. In September 2000, Sunrise Community Link Resource Centre was established.Sunrise Community Link exists to engage community members in creating their own successes - personally, socially, and financially. There are many opportunities and places to get help in Calgary, but often times, there is a gap between these opportunities and the people that need them the most. As a resource centre, it is Sunrises role to address this gap through systems navigation assistance. For many clients, Sunrise is the first place to call when they want to address certain circumstances in their lives, but dont know where to start. Sunrise offers its expertise on resources, whether that be through the open hearts and minds of its Community Advocates or by sharing the tools needed, but are otherwise unknown to the community members. Our core values at Sunrise Community Link include integrity, empathy, respect  dignity, proactive response, collaboration and honouring people.","Sunrises programs are offered as a choice and an opportunity for inclusion, education, and personal growth. Offering choice is empowering, and so is offering growth and education. Taking charge of your own life is the key to success. Presenting programming in this way inspires individuals to take control of their own lives and engage in their own enrichment.Many families and individuals struggle daily to makes ends meet financially, because of barriers to employment, such as not having access to childcare, or not knowing the language. There is an ongoing cycle of poverty that makes it very difficult to break out of once engulfed it. While focusing on surviving it is often difficult to see beyond this panicked state. Sunrise Community Link gives these individuals and families a chance to take a deep breath and let them know they are not alone. With this awareness and the proper tools their focus can be changed from just surviving to thriving. Sunrise does this by way of providing information, referrals and advocacy. Referrals to our partner agencies for such things as food, clothing, household items and furniture are done on a daily basis. This allows clients to access these basic needs without further financial burden. Sunrise also advocates for their families by creating relationships with other workers in the Social Service field. This might be Social workers at Alberta Works or Child and Family Services. It is when these agencies work together with their clients that most goals are met and clients needs are satisfied. Advocacy may also come in the form of mediating between a landlord and tenant regarding rental situations. Sometimes all it takes is a third perspective to accomplish something quickly that may have otherwise ended in an eviction and possibly homelessness. Advocacy comes in many forms. Empowering people to advocate for themselves is our ultimate goal.Our Community Advocates at Sunrise have been trained to facilitate money management workshops. These workshops are offered as an opportunity to look at household budgets and find creative ways to save money, and redirect money to where it will be most beneficial.To offer a weekly skill-building and socializing opportunity, Sunrise has endeavoured into the realm of social enterprise, by offering Kmitt Knitting Circles. The programs involves bringing socially isolated clients together with volunteers for weekly knitting circles with the goal of making mittens to raise awareness about poverty in Calgary. These mittens are sold using a one for one model, so for every pair of mittens sold through this initiative, another will be donated to someone currently experiencing poverty. Proceeds from sales will go to sustaining the program as well as reinforcing the operating costs of Sunrise Community Link.","\N","www.sunriselink.org","shaunap@sunriselink.org","863566592RR0001","403.204.8280","Shauna Parks","306719","hous client senior care",230,0.0307539682539683,0.0307539682539683,0.0277777777777778,0.0337301587301587,0.0277777777777778,0.0515873015873016,0.066468253968254,0.0307539682539683,0.319444444444444,0.0337301587301587,0.0307539682539683,0.146825396825397,0.0158730158730159,0.0307539682539683,0.123015873015873
"231",373,"Suzuki Talent Education Society (Calgary)","Alexander is a fun-loving boy, who was shocked when he discovered that violin was not going to become an easy instrument anytime soon.Part of the Suzuki Method of teaching is to use musical games to engage the children. However,they recognize that often we adults can find it quite taxing to invent enough of them. To counter this,the Suzuki Talent Education Society engages older students to mentor the younger ones. Noah was Alexanders mentor.They first met at weekly group classes for the five to eight-year-olds. As mentor and student-teacher,Noah would come to all the classes. With his imagination, Noah could relate to the kids in ways that adults could notwe would never have dreamed up the image of holding violins in a way to catch scoops of ice cream falling from the sky. Alexander adored Noah as a student teacher.At age six, Alexander was going through a patch of finding violin especially frustrating. His teacher, Wan-Tsai Chen, hit upon a brilliant idea: what about asking Noah if he would give Alexander weekly mentoring sessions. Most junior high kids would not embrace that, but Noah has grown up in the community of beautiful hearts that make upSuzuki Talent Education Society. He seized the chance to show Alexander the fun of making music. Noah has created innumerable games to mix music and fun for Alexander. Noah would often greet Alexander with a new creation, like cardboard Ninja stars with musical activities written on them, or giant homemade dice. Alexanders eyes shine every time we head to Noahs house for a lesson.Noah is showing Alexander the joy of music. What is an even rarer gift is that Noah is a model of what a kid can do to make the world a better place through generousity. Others at theSuzuki Talent Education Societyradiate that spirit, too, so I am not surprised when our kids are excited to play at seniors homes, or dream up the idea of busking to raise money for victims of Calgarys great flood of 2013.Alexander proudly raised a lot of money for UNICEF at his last birthday party. The lessons from Noah and others atSuzuki Talent Education Societyare working.For my seven-year-old son, Alexander, Suzuki Talent Education Society has not just exposed him to the joy of music and stretched his elastic brain,but hasalsobeen a community of beautiful hearts helping him to blossom into a beautiful heart,himself.","Character First, ability Second  Dr. SuzukiSuzuki Talent Education Society seeks to develop the hearts and minds of children with results beyond music itself including increased self-discipline, higher sensitivity, improved academic skills and a sense of confidence and self-esteem.This focus and rich history was realized in our performance last year at theCalgary Philharmonic Orchestrain combination with theJoshua Bell concert. We carry these thoughts through in our actions as we have performed for various charitable associations in the Calgary area, expanding our community and enhancing the lives of Calgarians has been a key driver.Using the Mother Tongue Approach or Suzuki Method (as it is also called), thousands of children world-wide are developing considerable abilities in such complex areas as music, languages and mathematics. Our society maintains this process and while focusing on music, expands our approach to character and community development.Dr. Suzukis fundamental beliefis that all children possess natural ability (Suzuki uses the word talent) that grows according to the degree to which it is nurtured (education). It is our focus to create an inclusive positive environment for students, parents and teachers to flourish.At Suzuki Talent Education Society, ability is fostered by parents and teachers working together with children. Parents create a home environment conducive to learning, structured listening and practice activities. Additionally our membership through concerts, group classes and social events builds a network to sustain and amplify this community.It is never too early to begin music education using the Suzuki Method. Training may begin as early as age zero by means of exposing children to selected recordings of good music at home until the children, even as infants, begin to recognize them.SUZUKI TALENT:In the fall of 2014,Suzuki Talent Education Society offered six programs to 138 childrenwithin the different programs inclusive of early child education, violin, piano, cello, flute and an ensemble. Our core focus and unique benefitlies is in our early childhood education program. An innovative and powerful resource that not onlyprovides the community with the core basis of Suzuki, it enables the students to achieve the necessaryfundamentals for future success.Are Suzuki students musical geniuses?Are they gifted children who have a special talent for music?Our students are active, intellegent members of our community that want to learn music in a caring supportive environment and embrace the parent teacher student model. A model in which each element supports each other and every child becomes an exceptional citizen with a love of music and nobility of character.","Thank you Mom and Dad for putting me in Suzuki Talent Education Society, you have given me the life long gift of music, and an appreciation for the arts - Recent GraduateLet It Ripple (we can shape who we are, and what we want to be):Suzuki Talent Education Society offers a wide range of classes and potential.

They graduate with a sense and love of arts, music, increased nobility and leadership. As our experienced students and parents continue their journey they assist and nurture our newer community members.We embrase our community to play past the instrument, echoing each others tone to influence and affect the songs of thier community.Community Collaboration The STES Board has been very active, working on the success of past boards in establishing a governance model and has been working to define a strategic business plan. In October 2014 our conversations expanded to our community partners.

"232",187,"The S.H.A.R.P. Foundation","Roberts Story: Robert was a complex man, who faced many complex problems in his life.At the age of eight, following years of physical, mental and emotional trauma, Robert became a ward of the foster care system. At the age of 16, Robert left the foster care system and became involved with street life. During these years, Robert struggled with drug and alcohol addictions and was in constant conflict with the criminal justice system.Later in life, Robert faced even more challenges when he was diagnosed with bipolar and borderline personality disorder, as well as HIV. His complex health needs continued to add additional challenges in his daily life, ultimately hindering his ability to live the life he wanted and deserved. Years of financial instability, substance abuse, and participation in the sex work industry, while continuing to deal with his complex health needs, marginalized Robert in his community. Ultimately, Robert became withdrawn and distrustful of community workers and social institutions. Although Robert had been referred to several specialists, addiction counselors and life skills programs, he was often refused treatment based on prior criminal convictions and anti-social behaviour.Because Robert did not have the opportunity to acquire conventional life skills as a youth, he often struggled to maintain his living space, his personal finances and even cooking for himself. Robert and his caseworkers recognized that his general well-being and quality of life would improve if the proper support systems could be accessed and utilized. In January of 2009, Robert became a resident in one of SHARP Foundations programs, giving him access to supportive resources that could assist him in areas of his life that were challenging to address on his own. Robert enjoyed the stability the SHARP program offered him; however, it soon became evident that Robert would benefit more from a program that was able to offer him higher levels of individual support and care.Robert was transferred to the more intensive, long-term care program offered by SHARP called Beswick House. Beswick House was able to help Robert stabilize his medication regime, while addressing his addictions and mental health concerns. It was at Beswick House that Robert flourished and became an active, contributing member in his local community. He often helped preparing meals, aided in household tasks, and offered assistance to the more disabled residents in the house.Robert came to love the community and companionship Beswick House offered and ways it enabled him to secure the structure, friendship and security he was unable to obtain prior to his residency. The support and compassion offered by the SHARP Foundation and supporting staff allowed Robert to pursue the life he truly wanted and deserved. Robert was able to participate in a community where he was understood and accepted, dramatically improving his health and well-being.Robert happily resided at Beswick House for three years until his sudden passing in 2013. Over 50 people from all parts of the community came together to celebrate his life; he would have appreciated knowing that he had touched the hearts of so many!","For 25 years, SHARP has been providing care for Calgarys most vulnerable people who constantly struggle to overcome barriers to services needed to address their complex health and social needs. Our clients often struggle with issues such as homelessness, mental illness, addictions, histories of abuse/violence, chronic diseases (HIV, Hep C, diabetes, cancers), brain injuries and more. Housing and supports are generally inaccessible to those living with HIV due to the stigma surrounding the complexities of the disease and associated factors such as sexual orientation, substance use and mental illness. Therefore, The SHARP Foundation is committed to providing avenues that ensure that affordable housing and accessible programming are available for individuals living with HIV.The SHARP foundation provides a nurturing environment to attract and retain highly skilled and compassionate people to deliver and support our clients, programs, and services. To ensure staff, volunteers, and service providers are best able to participate in creating healthy environments and promote health for our clients, we will provide education and awareness of issues including HIV, diversity, medical and/or social issues.-----In the last 25 years we have served over 350 people. Today we provide nationally recognized services to 69 clients through outreach and in five facilities. We offer 24/7 staffed medical/behavioural supports, peer-mentored homes and independent living apartments. We pride ourselves on providing compassionate, non-judgmental, respectful care to our clients, while fostering their ability to gain greater independence and improve their well-being. We do all of this for less than $100 per day per resident, which is anywhere from half the cost of hospice care to 1/18th the cost of acute hospital care.","SHARP creates safe, secure, non-judgmental environments where people can be themselves and discuss openly the challenges they face daily. It is in these spaces that clients begin to heal, engage in their own wellness, or in some cases, reclaim their dignity.We currently operate five programs located in Calgary residential neighbourhoods. Residents are provided with affordable housing and individualized support to meet their housing, medical, and psycho-social needs. After stabilizing an individuals medication regimen we provide programs to improve her/his quality of life.Our care, housing programs and services are targeted to individuals living with HIV coming from diverse communities or backgrounds (i.e., socio-economic, behavioural/lifestyle, religious/spiritual and cultural characteristics). Client history and/or lifestyle choices may include: homelessness, street involvement, illicit drug use and / or criminal activity. In some cases our clients may contact us directly for assistance, but in most cases they are referred by other agencies includingSouthern Alberta Clinic,Calgary Drop-In Centre,HIV Community LinkandSafeworks.SHARP provides compassionate care by:Respecting the inherent worth, identity, and dignity of each person without regard to ethnicity, religion, age, disability, gender, sexual orientation, orsocio-economicstatus.Believing in the whole person and supporting the physical, emotional, psychological, and spiritual needs of each person in an integrated manner.Supporting each person in an environment of acceptance, inclusiveness and safety.Promoting innovation, creativity, and professionalism in its programming.Developing effective partnerships and collaboration with diverse communities and organizations.Subscribingto a harm reduction approach where our philosophy is to maintain or enhance quality of life by providing non-judgemental care and support with compassion.Partnerships are critical for our organization to provide cost effective delivery of care and support for residents of Beswick House and Scott House.

Some of the factors that influence how we care for a patient are history, current state of well being, social support availability, and physical or mental disabilities. Age is also a factor we take into consideration as a secondary diagnosis such as cancer or Parkinsons disease is common with theageingof the patient. HIV hinders a persons immune system so these secondary diagnoses can have a severe effect on the patient.Not only is the demand for our Beswick House (24/7) program is increasing at a phenomenal rate, due to the aging of persons living with HIV, but Alberta Health Services has concluded that there is a total of 508 individuals in Calgary over the age of 50 living with HIV who are beginning to require higher levels of care.-----SHARP, in true Calgary fashion, will meet this challenge head-on so that this city remains accessible to all.

"233",797,"The Salvation Army Agapé Hospice","The mornings are always the best part of my days. Thats when I go and visit each of our Residents. There are times when Residents will be sound asleep, or in the tub room, soaking in a warm bath with calm, relaxing music playing on the stereo in the background. But the times I enjoy the most are when I am invited to share in the stories of a Residents life and learn more about them and their journey at Agapé Hospice.I will never forget the morning I first met John. When I walked into his room, he greeted me with a smile that was so welcoming and kind. In that moment it was hard to believe he was nearing the end of his life. John shared with me about the difficult decision to come to Agapé. Being a strong, independent and, at times, stubborn man, having to rely on others for care was a foreign concept. But, he quickly reassured me that his anxiety and hesitation were already put to rest. In the two days following his arrival, John felt like he was truly home. John delighted in the home cooked meals, especially the desserts, and the attentiveness of every individual who came to see him. His family had peace of mind knowing he was well taken care of and he felt so at home and at peace.It wasnt long into his stay that John reconfigured his room to include a reception area. Our rooms on average are the same size as a junior office in a 10 storey building, not super large, so creating a reception area was no easy feat. But being able to transform his hospice room into his home complete with his favourite chair, a crème coloured worn leather recliner, and matching ottoman, was something that brought joy to all of us working that day. He was able to maneuver his TV into one corner of the room, his dresser into another corner, and his hospital bed was pushed against a wall which faced opposite to an east window that would brightly shine and fill the room with warmth on sunny days. The maneuvering worked out like a game of Tetris and as you opened the door to his room, you were greeted by a perfect little sitting area, with room for a bedside table, a folding chair, and of course his favourite recliner. Our morning ritual always began with John asking me to take a seat in his reception area. John would sit at the end of the bed, and I in his favorite chair brought from home. Our conversations were so varied: books, sports, the playful squirrels in the garden, and yet they always ended in the same way. John would grab a hold of my hand, look me in the eye and say, Thank you, to all of you, for all you do, this is such a wonderful place.The morning before John died I went into his room to find his daughter keeping vigil in the infamous reception chair. I knew this was likely the last time I would be in Johns sacred reception space. Being minimally responsive, I was not sure whether John would know I was in the room. To my surprise he squeezed my hand as he did during our morning visits. In that moment, I had no words to express the gratitude that I felt and the privilege of knowing this man, even for only a short time.I have many of these encountersI feel blessed to be in a place where the people that we love and serve also fill our hearts and spirit.- Sarah Foster, Nursing Lead","The Salvation ArmyAgapé Hospice is a hospice providing a palliative care program with a specialattitude in a special setting for individuals and their families dealing with a terminal illness.Maximizing our Residents quality of life while they are facing death is the primary focus of the hospice program and team.

"235",336,"The Shakespeare Company Theatre in the Round Guild","On a cold afternoon in October, Glenn Davis, the lead actor in The Shakespeare Companys smash hit Othello was heading out of the theatre after a vibrant student matinee. Having recently performed on Broadway with none other than the late Robin Williams in Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo, Glenns resume is long and accomplished. As he walked towards the entrance of the theatre he was stopped by a young student who watched his performance in Othello.Hey, are you the guy that was in that show? asked the student.Yeah that was me. replied Glenn.Before I came to this show I hated Shakespeare, it made no sense. said the student. I didnt even want to come. But you know what?What? Asked GlennI understood everything! said the student. Shakespeare is AWESOME! We at the Shakespeare Company couldnt agree more,Shakespeare IS Awesome!For too long its been perceived as being complicated, long, and hard to understand.We make Shakespeare accessible, relevant and exciting, just as it was originally meant to be. We are committed to making great theatre for all to enjoy through innovative performances and inspired directing.William Shakespeare is the greatest story teller of all time! We believe that theatre has the power to change us, to make us better, to help us understand, and to feel empathy. The Shakespeare Company exists so that those who come to witness our shows can be enlivened, enriched and inspired.I appreciate the productions of Shakespeare company very much. They hold my interest, they are presented powerfully and I like the intimate theatre. I get a sense of why they stood the test of time as our human condition has not changed all that much. As a student in school I hated studying Shakespeare, it was boring and I didnt understand it. The Shakespeare Company has brought the plays alive for me and I realize had I had this opportunity then I would have been more engaged in English.- Brenda Sine, TSC Patron and DonorYou are fabulous. The kids still talk about Twelfth Night and Othello. Because of these productions, they love Shakespeare. King Lear was offered as a literature option this spring, with the other choice being a work of speculative fiction (Oryx and Crake, Margaret Atwood) and most chose to study Lear. How many teenagers do you know who would choose King Lear over a modern novel? Your company has an amazing energy about it, which is difficult to quantify, but quite easy to be swept up in.- Megan, Teacher, The Renert School","In July 1995 the landscape of Calgarys theatre scene was dominated by the large regional theatres with only a few small professional companies producing regular seasons. The amateur theatre scene was thriving but it was difficult for young actors, and directors to find regular work in a professional setting. It was against this backdrop that Richard Kenyon, a graduate of the Vancouver Playhouse Acting School, was motivated to start The Shakespeare Company (TSC). From the beginning Richard and his co-founder LuAnne Morrow had two goals in mind: to produce the plays of Shakespeare on a regular basis in innovative and approachable ways and to operate as a professional company, paying the artists and crew who worked on the shows, even if only a small amount, as recognition of the theatre as a profession and the skills, training and effort it requires to produce a great show.The first production The Shakespeare Company produced wasHenry Vand was performed in the round at the small space at the Pumphouse Theatre.The spirit and energy of that first show infused the company for the next 16 years. The Shakespeare Company continued to produce 3-5 Shakespeare plays a year. They started a summer festival in Canmore and developed new plays inspired by Shakespeare. The works of Shakespeare were a constant inspiration and the feedback from audiences, many of whom were exposed to Shakespeare for the first time at TSC shows, was confirmation that the passion of the founders for the Bard went well beyond the company members. In 2012 Haysam Kadri, took the helm of TSC as its new Artistic Producer. Determined to take the company to the next level, Kadri, a 6 year veteran of the Stratford Festival in Ontario, had three goals.Grow the audience. Become more of an integral part of the Calgary Theatre scene.Become the hottest ticket in town!In three short years, Haysam met all these goals and so much more. The Shakespeare Company is very proud of its many accomplishments. Here are some stats:Increased the number of students seeing our outreach shows by 53% (In 2011 the average number of students that saw our outreach shows was a little over 3500. In 2014 we will finish the year with having over 6000 students attend our outreach shows.)Increased the number of public performances by 116% (in 2011 The Shakespeare Company produced, on average, 35 performances. As of 2014 we will have over 80 public performances.)Increased the number of attendees to our performances by a staggering 480% (In 2011 the average number of overall attendees was just a little over 2000. In 2014 we our on track to see well over 12,000Increased the number of artist we hire by almost 170% (In 2011 32 artists were hired. In 2014 we hired over 80 artists.)As The Shakespeare Company looks to the future we have new goals and new dreams. We look to have permanent home, continue to grow our subscription base, create a company that has an international reach and create a training ground for the classical actors of the future.","Mainstage Productions -Every year The Shakespeare Company produces 4 mainstage productions. Our focus is on William Shakespeares Cannon of plays and other Shakespeare inspired works. We are committed to making Shakespeare accessible through innovative performances and inspired directing. In addition to this we provide opportunities for emerging artists to work alongside seasoned actors and directors. Each year we employ 25-30 emerging artists. It is our goal to create a lean and mean Shakespeare experience, highlighting the best of the Bard in all his comedy, tragedy, and bawdiness.http://www.shakespearecompany.com/currentseason/Page to Stage Outreach -Our Page to Stage Outreach Program brings dynamic Shakespeare performance to high schools. A live performance can improve understanding of Shakespeare, improve marks, inspire, solicit self-reflection, and strengthen the spirit of a school.http://www.shakespearecompany.com/education/outreach/DiVerseCity -This is a new initiative by The Shakespeare Company to create an ensemble of actors of diverse ethnicities to perform Shakespeare in all four quadrants of Calgary. Because Shakespeares stories and characters are universal, his text is ideal for showcasing ethnic diversity- a quality Calgary has, but often does not highlight. With colour blind casting, strong artists will have an opportunity to tackle Shakespeares best characters and bring a new perspective to Calgarians. Indeed, why not have an Asian Romeo, an Aboriginal Portia, and a Black Hamlet? Each artists background will infuse their performance. Skin tone or ethnicity will not be a barrier for them to be cast, one step towards encouraging strong artists to stay in Calgary rather than seek work elsewhere and increasing the representation of the many faces of Calgary in theatre. DiVerseCity is also focused on accessibility for all Calgarians. The ensemble will perform Shakespearean scenes and monologues on platforms along the C-train line and other busy thoroughfares. Site specific theatre is less intimidating for non-theatre goers, and were bringing Shakespeare for free to areas where people live and commute to work.. We will be partnering with local organizations to promote the events.http://www.shakespearecompany.com/diversecity/","The Shakespeare Company is nothing without our supporters and audience members. In her book, The Actor Speaks: Voice and the Performer, renowned british theatre director, voice coach and author,Patsy Rodenburg writes,Finally, a word or two about the audience. You do matter. A receptive, listening audience is as creative as the actor. That reception will be felt and creatively used by the performer who, without any doubt, will feel your response even if it is just rapt attention. Without an audience theatre does not exsist. Shakespeares audience walked past taverns, brothels and blood sports to get to the theatre. They made a kind of pilgrimage and wanted to be there to listen, to feel, to be changed.If you love Shakespeare and are inspired to help us grow into the company we dare to dream is possible, then please contact us to learn more about how you or your organization can support the work we do.You matter!

We take a seat in front of the stage, surrounded by strangers. Each of us is open to being stimulated, surprised, provoked and filled with wonder and delight.

We have developed an Emerging Artists Program of the highest caliber, designed to invest in the younger generation, develop their skills and increase the pool of talent that is at the core of artistic excellence.With a commitment to emerging artists, Theatre Calgary began producing Shakespeare by the Bowin 2012. Shakespeare by the Bow is a bridge for theatre school graduates that helps transition them to a professional acting career. Using the great texts of William Shakespeare as the foundation, these artists train in a professional setting with some of Canadas leading professional artists. Throughout the summer they share their work with Calgarians by performing in thebeautiful outdoor setting of Princes Island Park.Through this program, we have inspired and mentored57 theatre school graduates with a comprehensive learning experience. In addition to the practicum experience they receive from performing the play, they also benefit from coaching and workshops during the rehearsal process.Participating in Shakespeare by the Bow was one of the best experiences I have had in theatre. It is unlike anything available to emerging artists in Alberta. In one swoop it provided me with greater understanding of Shakespearean text, performing experience, great connections with other emerging artists and influential people in professional theatre and a summer full of fantastic memories. I can honestly say that Shakespeare by the Bow launched my professional acting career.                                     - Julia Guy, Shakespeare by the Bowemerging artistFor Theatre Calgary, we see the development of new talent as vital to encouraging the health and well-being of the sector.

"237",775,"Theatre Junction Society","Theatre Junction has a new kind of vision. To be a different kind of arts centre. To evolve and expand its activities and be a place where our best artists in Calgary can develop and bring their work to the stage; where visual art, performance art and media like film and digital art create a hub of activity and exploration. To become a revitalized public space that increases its civic footprint, participates in the life of the city and creates a culture of innovation and learning through the arts.Thats a tall order for a small theatre in Calgary. However, we know things need to change: in this age of technological isolation people are seeking new ways to connect, to be inspired and get in touch with their own creativity and help make Calgary a great city. Arts centres need to provide new meaning and broaden their scope to include not just the arts, but arts-based practices that contribute to the life of the city.Theatre Junction is stepping up its role. This season, our 26th, reflects that. We have a new slate of programming, in addition to our season of live art: film, dance and visual art as well as new offerings of arts-based opportunities for leadership and personal development. We want to connect, bring people into the space and participate in events that are happening throughout the city. Be in service to the community and an active participant in it: opening our doors for Doors Open YYC, 10 Minute Plays for Janes Walk and Exposure photography festival were just a few things we did in our 2016/17 season and we will continue to expand on those.Our award-winning high school mentorship program, TJLabs and our new program premiering in September, 2017, NEXT STAGE, creates a through line for artistic development and nurtures young artists to develop new work and present it to an audience. These programs alleviate the costs young companies face in Calgary: renting space, technical support and box office and marketing, allowing them to explore and create new work. Most importantly, it will foster a sense of belonging and an environment where artists can create and present work in Calgary.And we need your help to do it. We need your help to become the culture house we aspire to be: one that brings a plethora of artistic events and experiences to the city, but incubates the next generation of artists in Calgary.","Our goal is to be an arts centre rooted in community, relevant and in service to the public and fostering the development of artists in Calgary.Theatre Junction has three areas of focus:presenting new contemporary performance artnurturing and developing a new generation of artistsshifting the idea of an arts centre to one that is holistic, where the community can come together to create and imagine a rich cultural fabric in Calgary.Our mission describes our purpose and values as 4-Cs:a CONTAINER providing physical, emotional and psychological space for creation and artistic riska CONVENER eliciting purpose and bringing people together to develop our local artistsa CONNECTOR connecting people and ideas this is at the heart of artistic presentationa CATALYST promoting awareness, response and action encouraging initiatives that aim to nurture local talent and create a more sustainable and vibrant arts ecology.Our season of live art tests the boundaries of traditional theatre and performance and challenges patrons to experience new and exciting ways of telling a story. The shows we present often use text, music, dance and physicality to immerse the audience in a collective experience. These are shows you wont see anywhere else, and sometimes not even elsewhere in Canada.We believe that a successful city has a vibrant and rich arts culture, where people can engage in multiple offerings and disciplines. It is also a place where artists can live, and create and perform work. Artists face many barriers to living a successful life in Calgary and we aim to reduce those barriers by offering programs and activities that are free for artists to develop their work over time. Mentorship, TJLabs, Next Stage and our Janes Walk event, 10 Minute Plays for Janes Walk are just a few of the opportunities we provide to artists throughout the year.In order for arts centres like Theatre Junction to evolve and remain relevant to their audience, and to artists, we are shifting our vision from one that is primarily inwardly focused, to one that is rooted in Community. Developing programs that bring artists, students, members of the public and corporate communitiy together to learn and develop their creativity through arts-based practices creates a richer fabric and deeper cultural connection. Participating in Janes Walk events through 10 Minute Plays, hosting open space gatherings for artists and arts centres to talk about how to support arts culture in Calgary and looking at themes like prosperity through an arts lens are ways we will be relevant to the Calgary community.","Theatre Junction, in addition to presenting a season of contemporary performance theatre in a variety of genres from Calgary, across Canada and internationally, has a vision for building a rich, local arts culture. Our goal is to grow the next generation of artists in the city by providing access to studio space, performance space, dramaturgy, technical support and box office/marketing/administrative support. Weve discovered these barriers inhibit creation, so by removing them we allow artists to explore and take risks with their work. We do this through many different programs and offerings:High School Mentorship - accredited by the Calgary Board of Education, 15-20 high school students have the opportunity to research, develop and present a play they develop with the support of a local playwright and Theatre Junction Associate Artist. This two-year program develops personal and interpersonal skills, grows confidence and provides students the opportunity to develop theatre skills. At the end of the two years, the students present their work on our main stage, the Flanagan Theatre. Our current playwright in residence is award winning playwright Geoffrey Simon Brown.TJLabs - helping artists and emerging collectives explore new work and get it ready to present to an audience is the goal of TJLAbs. Three phases of this program, incubation, discovery and help artists develop their work. We provide free studio time, technical support, dramaturgy and help with marketing/promotion.Masterclasses - having the opportunity to work with a professional and glean insight from their style, experience and methods are the goalsl of Masterclasses. Visiting artists provide a day-long workshop with interested professionals in our studio. Masterclasses are free.Next Stage - our newest program, offered in the 2017/18 season. Four new or mid-career artists/companies will receive free studio time, tech support and have the opportunity to present their work to an audience. This program removes barriers most artists face in presenting live art in Calgary: affordable space, professional technical support and marketing. Next Stage provides all of this, and shares box office revenue with the artists to sustain the program.","Support Theatre JunctionBy donating to Theatre Junction, donors will:support the development and nurturing of new and emerging artists in Calgary, fostering a rich cultural vibrancy in the city.support a multidisciplinary program of live art, visual art, music and film. We believe in paying artists for their work, which can be challenging for a charity however to be true supporters of an emerging arts scene, we value the work of our local artists. For example, artists who participated in 10 Minute Plays for Janes Walk were paid an honorariam. As were artists who performed at, or created work for our fundraising event, La Nuit Sauvage.be a catalyst for personal and professional development opportunities, using movement, dance and arts-based practices that build leadership and personal skills.help sustain Calgarys oldest theatre.help bring new, contemporary and multidisciplinary work from Calgary, across Canada and beyond to local audiences. Its the chance to see work you wont see anywhere else.We are hoping potential sponsors and donors will support our programming and help us foster and nurture a rich arts culture in Calgary. Our High School Mentorship, TJLabs and Next Stage programs are all excellent opportunities for corproate sponsorship and recognition. In addition, our season of live performance welcomes support for shows, or as a marquee season sponsor.","http://www.theatrejunction.com","guy@theatrejunction.com","134483981RR0001","403.205.2922","Guy de Carteret","8889554","art perform artist theatr",237,0.0124610591900312,0.00778816199376947,0.014797507788162,0.0334890965732087,0.0334890965732087,0.0545171339563863,0.0264797507788162,0.014797507788162,0.0428348909657321,0.0218068535825545,0.014797507788162,0.0194704049844237,0.659657320872274,0.0334890965732087,0.0101246105919003
"238",268,"Trinity Place Foundation of Alberta","As a former professor, Arthur was comfortable teaching hundreds of students at a time and was very active in his church and his community. During a hospital stay for unrelated issues, complications caused a complete loss of vision. Devastated by this development, he became despondent and paranoid,believing that his physicians caused his blindness. His mistrust of doctors meant he wasnt getting the healthcare he needed andhe sent home care providers away.Further complicating his situation, Arthur developed a syndrome in whichindividuals with partial or severe blindness experience complex visual hallucinations. This combination of factors anda the lack of family or a social support network meant that Arthur became a recluse, isolating himself from society, and from the care that he needed.A social worker at TPFA recognized that Arthur was an ideal candidate for theIndependent Living Skills (ILS) program funded by the Calgary Foundation. He had little or no social or family support, was socially isolated, and could benefit from additional help to maintain his quality of life. The ILS worker worked with Arthur to encourage him to take small steps to come out of his shell. Once a week, the ILS worker took Arthur for a walk or went for coffee with him and checked to make sure Arthur had the groceries he needed. The ILS worker also connected him with CNIB for shopping support.I could see that Arthur was becoming more comfortable with me, the ILS worker commented, Because each time we had an appointment he was dressed and ready to go when I arrived.Although Arthur still isnt comfortable talking to doctors, and in fact hasnt seen one in two years, the ILS workers were able to convince him to see a nurse practitioner when he wasnt feeling well.Arthur and the nurse practitioner have set up a medical plan for him, so in case of an emergency, Arthur will get  and accept  the help he needs.I can confidently say that the ILS program has dramatically improved Arthurs quality of life, asserts the ILS worker. He had kind of given up. He didnt see that there could be any other way of life, and had resigned himself to the fact that God would take him soon.His outlook has changed completely, another ILS worker adds, He is looking to the future  making plans for weeks from now. Thats the result were looking for.*Name changed to protect privacy.","Fe was an active senior who enjoyed cooking, baking and chasing after her grandkids. At the age of 61, she suffered a stroke that left her with partial paralysis. Whether using a wheelchair or walker, regular chores like cooking, loading the dishwasher and putting away the dishes became impossible in her apartment.Frustrated by this lack of independence, Fe and her husband decided to make the move to a housing complex that was affordable and wheelchair accessible. A friend recommended Trinity Place Foundations Glenway Gate. The barrier-free design, spacious layouts and accessible appliances were all features that would improve their day-to-day living and give Fe her independence back.With cupboards that raise and lower at the push of a button, an accessible stove and side-loading dishwasher, Fe has taken over the kitchen again -- something both she and her husband are happy about. They are also happy about the feeling of community at Glenway Gate. From coffee klatches in the lounge to barbecues on the patio, the residents truly feel like neighbours, making Glenway Gate truly feel like home. Glenway Gate is a model for enhancing independence through careful attention to design and accessibility.Waynebecame involved in TPFAs Independent Living Skills (ILS) program when neighbours alertedstafftoconcerns over Waynes declining health. In less than six months hed lost almost 80lbs and had aged dramatically. When the team visited him for the first time he was barely able to catch a breath and hadnt eaten for almost two weeks. Due to a previous experience, Wayne had anxiety about seeking medical care and refused to see a doctor. The team offered to accompany him to urgent care, where it was discovered he had a severe lung infection requiring urgent hospitalization.Following his return home from hospital two weeks later, ILS workers helped Wayne get his apartment set up to manage his recovery, connected him with a number of community services, and checked in on him regularly. He is back in his apartment now, where he continues to recover and is living healthier. He has developed better eating habits and no longer requires a walker to get around. Wayne credits theILS staff for saving his life.WHAT WE DOAt TPFA we recognize that as people age they are often confronted and confounded bychanges to their mental or physical health. These issues may jeopardize a persons confidence, judgement, andability to maintain a good quality of life.The ILS program provides tangible and practical ways toassist tenants torecover their independence andto age in place. In some cases, such as Waynes, timely intervention can actually be life saving.Mission statementTo enrich the quality of life of low-income seniors in Calgary with innovative programs and services and effective administration of the housing we manage.Vision statementTo be a leading Calgary seniors organization seeking continuous improvement in the quality of its facilities, services and supports to low-income seniors.Achievements-CCVO Calgary Non-profit Innovation Award - February 18, 2014.This award celebrates inventive service offerings and acts to showcase organizations that think outside-the-box to solve problems for vulnerable populations in Calgary, such as low-income seniors. TPFA CEO Lawrence Braul states,Were really proud to be recognized for our collaboration with Bow Valley College (BVC) and the multi-generational living solution that is making a difference for both the students in need of housing and TPFA tenantsin need of positive social interaction.TPFA was experiencing increased vacancies at their East Village buildings and recognized that this situation was in fact an opportunity. TPFA approached Bow Valley College with the hopes of addressing two problems: a shortage of affordable student housing in Calgary, and feelings of isolation among seniors.A unique program was launched to offer subsidized housing at TPFAs Murdoch Manor to 15 BVC students in exchange for their time volunteering with senior residents in the building. The students help where needed to plan social events, give computer tips, assist with household tasks or simply spend time sharing stories.This collaboration with Bow Valley College led to a multi-generational living solution that is making a difference for both the students in need of housing and our TPFA seniors in need of positive social interaction and resulted in TPFA winning the 2013 CCVO Innovation Award.Recognition - 2013 McKillop Awards Winner for Excellence in Leadership(Video 2:35)Lawrence Braul, CEO of Trinity Place Foundation of Alberta (TPFA),received the 2013 McKillop Award for Excellence in Leadershipon September 26th, 2013. The awardrecognizes staff employed in not-for-profit leadership positions who have made a contribution toward sustaining and improving human services work through visionary leadership action, advocacy and collaboration.","Independent Living Skills (ILS)This innovative pilot project was initiated by TPFA to help address the social isolation of seniors and help residents maintain their independence and quality of life by better managing tasks of daily living. The program helps residents who may be struggling with issues exacerbated by physical or mental changes associated with aging. With a persistent shortage of affordable supportive housing in Calgary, more low income seniors are living independently but sometimes lack the supports they need to manage the tasks of daily living during an illness or following a stayin the hospital.This pilot projectis funded bythe Government of Canada, the New Horizons program, and by the Calgary Foundation enablingTPFA to employ two ILS workers who provide support to 80 seniors. Synergy Research group is performing a formal independent evaluation of the program with support from the United Way of Calgary and Area.On-site social work staffTPFA is one of the only operators of independent subsidized housing to offer social work staff at most of its building locations. The program was launched to help tenants to navigate the health care systemandmaintainaconnection withneededmedical supports and services.The role of our social workers is to advocate on behalf of our residents and link them to health care and community resources. Their focus is to do what they can to bring about the highest possible quality of life by preserving and promoting physical and mental health for our residents. Some examples of how they can help include:Helping navigate the health care system to find the right services and programsProviding tools and services to deal with the emotional aspects of agingHelping to access government benefits and other programs available to seniorsFinding the right community resourcesIntergenerational program to reduce isolationInspired by a unique project in Red Deer, TPFA recognized that the vacancy situation in one our buildings was an opportunity to be creative. TPFA approached Bow Valley College (BVC) with the hopes of addressing two problems: a shortage of affordable student housing in Calgary and feelings of isolation among seniors.In exchange for subsidized housing at TPFAs Murdoch Manor, 15 BVC students volunteer with senior residents in the building.

After years of advocacy and effort, Peter Coyle Place wasbuilt and opened in 2005. TPFA consulted withcolleaguesin Western Canada and refined the design of the structure and the harm reducation philosophy of care to suit older adults with complex medical needs.The result is a modern 70-unit supportive care facilitythat truly benefits seniors with complex medical needs. Medical supports are offered by the Alex Seniors Clinic through aninnovative partnership with the Alex Seniors Health Centre. Home Care and personal care ismade available through a site based Home Care program.The Alex Seniors Health Centre About15 years ago, the Alex Medical Clinic in Inglewood was being asked to find a new home. TPFA recognized that there was space available to accommodate a medical clinic in King Tower and within months, the Alex Seniors Clinic was on site.Timely access to medical care was difficult for many tenants who did not have a personal physician. It made perfect sense to work closely with the Alex. This long-term partnership has resulted in decreased emergency medical visits and hospitalizations because a tenant can now easily walk to the clinic and be seen by one of the excellent Alex medical staff.Diversified communities support inclusive livingLocated in the heart of Glamorgan, Glenway Gate serves an important need in the community. By offering a mix of affordable and market units, TPFA has created an inclusive community for the older adult population who desire to remain in the community, close to friends and local amenities such as banks and shopping.Twelve of the buildings 42 suites are barrier-free and incorporate many accessibility features to ensure the building meets the unique needs of seniors with mobility challenges. Communities become complete when diverse housing forms are developed that allow people to move through the phases of life and remain in the community. Glenway Gate has become a highly desirable location in the community of Glamorgan.","TPFA is a proud partner in the RESOLVE campaign.

His lack of self-confidence was evident and influenced his school life tremendously. We had the privilege of working with Albert through our Earn-a-Bike program.Throughout the eight weeks of our program, our facilitators were ecstatic to see this withdrawn youth open up and realize his full potential. What was first a reluctance to participate eventually became unbridled enthusiasm for getting his hands dirty  sharing his ideas. As another successful Earn-a-Bike program graduation day arrived, our participants were encouraged to try out their new bikes in the soccer field behind the school. Most were delighted for this opportunity  except Albert. Having never ridden a bike before in his life  he expressed that he would rather just walk his bike home and practice privately. With a little encouragement and riding tips from the facilitators  volunteers, Albert gathered his newfound confidence and within ten minutes was riding alongside the others  his smile as big as the soccer field.Most people have a First Bike story. They can often remember the details of their first cycling experience. Who they were with, where they were and how they felt biking for the first time. We are honoured to be a part of Alberts first bike story.","Two Wheel View (TWV)provides life-changing experiences for young people. TWV is a mission driven organization that creates opportunities for young people to learn and practice lessons in leadership, health and wellness, self-esteem, achievement, and environmental stewardship through their participation in bicycle education programs and bike trips.TWV believes that all youth should have the opportunity to expand their physical and cultural boundaries. There are many youth that are never exposed to what may provide the greatest source of learning - real life experiences that bring home valuable insights and logical steps for positive change.Rick and Tanya McFerrin founded TWV in 2000 after a two-year bicycle expedition around the world. Their experiences and perspectives on the world, as seen from the seat of a bike, created the basis for TWV.-----OUR FIVE YEAR PLANOver the next 5-years, TWV will serve more than 3,000 youth through high impact after school programs, community education and expedition programs.GOAL 1: Become Leaders in Youth Development ProgrammingTWV will serve 2,000 youth in 25 new program locations in Calgary.TWV will serve 1,000 youth  community leaders in 50 Community Education Programs.GOAL 2: Become Leaders in Youth Cycling ExpeditionsTWV will lead 35 expeditions for 350 youth in Canada, USA, Argentina, and Norway.Engage host communities in program development and cultural exchange.GOAL 3: Strengthen Organizational Capacity for Long Term SuccessDevelop local and national partnerships to extend TWV reach.Raise TWV profile in Calgary, nationally and abroad.","TWV programs increase youth resiliency and lessen risk factors of students through cognitive development, social competence, and emotional and physical wellbeing; thus increasing their likelihood of future success. We do this in two ways:The Earn-a-Bike Bike Club program uses the bike as a tool to develop leadership and teamwork skills as well as bike mechanic capabilities in youth ages 11-17. Each week participants come to program where they receive a healthy snack, play games and discuss the daily lessons in both character (community, leadership, self-esteem) and bike mechanics (fixing a tire, gear adjustments, chains, brakes etc). They have the opportunity to use tools and disassemble and reassemble bikes every week.In Bike Club youth:Use tools and learn about bikes and bike mechanicsTake part in active games,, bike rides and have funEat healthy snacks, practice leadership skill and gain confidenceEarn a bike, lock and helmet of their ownFor many of our participants, this is the only way they can afford to get a bike. More than just a toy, these bikes are helping our youth get to school, to part-time jobs or to other after school activities as well as keeping them physically active. Our program builds confidence and teaches them life-long skills in a safe, encouraging and hands-on learning environment. They also have the opportunity to connect with positive adult mentors who provide guidance, friendship and support during the program.Our Bike Trip programs target students 14 years old and older, allowing them connect with the natural environment and actively participate in an adventurous experience. Imagine spending a few weeks riding a bike through a remote region of Argentina or Norway, cycling the scenic bikeways in Quebec or riding into western Canadas mountain parks  experiencing outdoor adventure, exploring new cultures, expanding your mind.TWV offers a grass-roots approach to bicycle travel that allow students to take part in daily trip planning, engage with local communities, participate in service-learning projects and raise their level of environmental and social awareness. Participants gain strength, confidence, and perspective as they create memories that will last a lifetime.

"240",459,"Universal Rehabilitation Service Agency (URSA)","Simon was born with a multitude of concerns immediately from birth. Due to a lack of blood and oxygen to the brain, Simon was diagnosed with spastic quadriplegia Cerebral Palsy along with a seizure and pain disorder. This diagnosis was life alternating, not only for Simon, but his parents, Liz and Andre.Many questions went unanswered as only time would tell how Simons disability would affect his quality of life and the typical milestones of childhood development.The first few years were difficult for both Simon and his parents. Many days were spent attempting to sooth Simon through constant holding and physical contact and distractions in the form of music. As he was unable to communicate his needs, wants or desires, Simons parents were left wondering what was causing their little boy to cry all day. Between working and caring for medically fragile child, the family was soon overwhelmed and their role of parents transitioned into the role of full time caregivers.Simons health needs increased in complexity as did the amount of daily medications, supplements and personal care. Simon soon had an exhaustive list of medical professionals from surgeons, specialists, nurses, and physiotherapists. Simons parents continued to adapt to their sons ever changing medical needs and learned to manage complex medical regimes.Simon was unable to tolerate the use of a wheelchair, sleep independently or leave the family home. Simons parents spent many days and nights holding and rocking him, trying to take away their sons discomfort and pain. Mentally, physically, and emotionally the overall family unit began to crumble. They were alone and afraid of the unknown for their son and family.On September 1, 2012 Liz and Andre made the toughest decision of their lives and choose to have Simon permanently placed in care. For parents to make a decision like this for their five year old son was heartbreaking. They did not know if they were doing the right thing.And then there was a break in the clouds. His parents no longer needed to be Simons nurses and caretakers. They only had to be one thing, his mom and dad.Over a number of months, a routine was developed and a plan was set in place and as Simon became familiar with his various caregivers and environment, positive changes started to occur. With support and guidance, Simons parents continued transitioning into their role of mom and dad. They no longer were required to monitor, manage and implement Simons complex medications and care routines. They were able to focus on their son, family, and rebuilding personal relationships. Soon the family unit began to flourish.Simon excelled in a multitude of areas both developmentally and physically. Simon now uses his wheelchair on a daily basis, sleeps alone and tolerates new, loud and what would have been overwhelming environments, strengthening his independence. Simon started exploring the city and participated in many events outside the home like the Calgary Zoo and swimming.A milestone achievement was accomplished when Simon successfully completed his first year of school, attending fulltime, five days a week. Simon continues to amaze his parents and family as he reaches goals and truly demonstrates the level of excellence one can achieve in life. Simons parents continue to be heavily involved in his personal growth and development through their daily visits to the home. Through laughter, cuddling, music, and participation in family activities, the family is now truly thriving. This cannot be more evident as Simon recently became a big brother and welcomed the newest member to the family, his sister, Stella.Simon continues to teach each individual he comes into contact with that love, happiness, and joy goes hand in hand with a child with a development disability. He has excelled both developmentally, physically and emotionally and will continue to accomplish goals his parents never dreamed were possible for him.","Before 1985, it was common belief that individuals with disabilities could not survive in the community and would have to be placed in institutions. URSA challenged that belief and in 1985, opened five residential homes to 30 clients from Calgarys Baker Centre. These five homes were just that, homes. These clients not only survive in the community setting, they thrive. URSA now has 16 homes in Calgary. The majority of these individuals have very significant and multiple disabilities including; requiring feeding, personal care support for bathing/ hygiene, and 24-hour staff support for all areas of life. One of these homes is URSAs childrens home which provides care for those under 18 years old. Another is our Kootenay Lodge home, a home for at-risk aboriginal adults with disabilities.In the early 90s URSA expanded into brain injury services and developed Easy Street  an indoor city block with a diner, taxi cab, grocery store, beauty shop, bus, bank, and apartment. A safe place for clients to learn and relearn everyday skills.URSA also has several day programs for our clients to attend. Clients are able to participate in any number of activities and outings including: crafting; gardening; swimming; visits to the zoo and TELUS Spark; day trips out of the city; etc. Anything our clients want to do, they go out and do it!In 2009, URSA opened Camp URSA  a recreational facility out of the city that is fully wheelchair accessible. An opportunity for individuals with disabilities or a brain injury to escape the city and relax with family, friends, or caregivers. The wheelchair accessibility means that clients have no physical barriers and can enjoy the camp to the fullest. Camp URSA provides bedding, linen and meals to campers to help make the trip easier to plan and more enjoyable. It is a chance for clients to get out of the city and enjoy mother nature.URSA continues to grow and develop and we currently have 23 programs including: 24/7 homes, day programs, brain injury service programs, a childrens home, an aboriginal home, and accessible camp. URSA makes it possible for individuals with disabilities to live and thrive in Calgary communities. We ensure not only the basic necessities for these individuals are provided, but go above and beyond ensuring individual goals and dreams are made a reality so that they can live the fullest life possible.MISSION | To develop and provide opportunities for individuals with disabilities to attain a personal level of achievement and excellence in life!VISION | To provide an excellent service to individuals and their families to maximize quality of life in a wholistic manner.","URSA is continually in development; we currently have 23 programs including: 24/7 homes, day programs, brain injury service programs, a childrens home, an aboriginal home, and accessible camp.

Roger likes the color green; actually thats an understatement, Roger LOVES the color green. Last year a corporate volunteer group of 20 people came and did a while you were out day of caring. They redid four URSA client bedrooms, including Rogers. They bought him new bedroom furniture, bedding, a new lamp, and art for his walls. They also painted his room (for the first time in over 20 years) a nice shade of, yes, green. Roger came home that afternoon and was shown his new room by his staff. No one was sure how he was going to react to his new room, especially with 20 strangers watching him. He paused at his door. He slowly rolled over to the newly painted green wall and very gently rubbed his hand along it. He smiled. It was quite evident that Roger was thrilled with his new room, filled with green.You can change a life by the simplest donation of your time. URSAs While you Were Out campaigns are a great way to get involved and directly impact someones life, like Roger, and are perfect for team building. These can include:Redoing a client room for them while they are out of the house (painting, new furniture, new bedding and lighting, etc.)Yard cleanup and planting. All our homes require assistance with gardening and yard cleaning every spring and fall. Our clients greatly enjoy getting in the dirt and assisting in making their yards summer ready.Other volunteer opportunities include:Joining our brain injury clients on their Rehab on the Mountain trips. Three trips to the mountains happen each year with 10 clients. Volunteers can spend the day with clients helping them participate in the multitude of activities including: skiing, white water rafting, hiking, horse back riding, dog sledding, and more!Helping URSA put on events for our clients including: Stampede Bar-B-Q, URSA Games, and the Client Christmas Party. Volunteers can help make and serve food to clients and participate in the fun!Spending one-on-one time with clients. This can include: reading to them, playing board games, arts  crafts, swimming, joining them at the Talisman Centre  whatever your interests are, our clients are interested too.The possible volunteer opportunities are endless and make great team building activities. Please contact URSA for more information on these options and see what a difference a day makes in the lives of our clients.

"241",330,"Urban Society for Aboriginal Youth ","After my sisters death, my family was broken. My mom and dad were no longer able to take care of my siblings and myself.I remember feeling alone, isolated, and shifted from my collapsing family home to strangers and back again. Forced to leave my school, move and leave behind homes and friends, I was being forgotten. My empty hands grabbing, reaching, wanting to feel the way I felt before everything went wrong. I had been walking numbly and lost for a while.Finally, my Aunt found me and enrolled me in school, took care of me, gave me love.In my new school, I was told about a school program with USAY for Aboriginal kids. I was experiencing so many negative things in my life, but the USAY people reached out, took my hand and helped me find my way through, by letting me figure it out on my own, but letting me know I wasnt alone.Now, I know I have a lot of people at USAY in my corner. I know that I can reach for my future, and I am proud to say that I just got my diploma.","The Urban Society for Aboriginal Youth has been an influential not-for profit organization in Calgary since 2001. USAY strives to provide essential programming and services to Calgarys Aboriginal youth between the ages of twelve and twenty-nine years.USAY Mission Statement:The Urban Society for Aboriginal Youth (USAY) will enrich the lives of all urban Aboriginal youth by nurturing self-empowerment and fostering healthy collaboration and communication to ensure healthy future generations.USAY Vision Statement:The Urban Society for Aboriginal Youth (USAY) will be recognized as a fundamental organization in society, empowering urban Aboriginal youth to envision and attain a healthy sustainable future while upholding traditional Aboriginal values.1999 Redmond Little Chief organized a suicide awareness conference, titled Wake Up Call, in the Aboriginal Community. The strongest recommendation from the conference was for the development of an Aboriginal youth council to assist the Mayor of Calgary in decisions of policy and strategy on issues concerning Aboriginal Youth in the city. With this recommendation in mind, Mr. Little Chief coordinated a roundtable to discuss the opportunities and strategies of the council. From this roundtable the Mayors Aboriginal Youth Advisory Committee (MAYAC) was formed.Armed with fresh ideas and the support of Mayor Al Duerr, MAYAC formed a board of a second entity, the Urban Society for Aboriginal Youth (USAY). In 2000, USAY hosted the 1st Annual Firekeepers Gathering aimed at assisting Aboriginal youth with issues concerning personal achievement in an urban setting. The success of the Firekeepers Gathering encouraged the board to explore other opportunities for Aboriginal youth in Calgary, and to see where USAY could provide services to ensure the experience of living in Calgary for Aboriginal youth is a positive one.In 2001, with support from Family and Community Support Services, United Way of Calgary and Area, the Métis Nation of Alberta and Alberta Community Development, USAY was established as a not-for-profit organization and began paving the way as one of Calgarys leading organizations for Aboriginal youth.Today, USAY continues to serve Calgarys Aboriginal community and provide youth with opportunities for advancement through board and volunteer opportunities.USAY will continue to seek out new opportunities and develop programming that will help and encourage Aboriginal youth to live healthy and successful lives in the city of Calgary.Thank you for your support to help USAY make the goals, dreams and aspirations of our members a reality.","The following is a list and brief description of the programs implemented by USAY:Aboriginal Recruitment Strategy The Aboriginal Recruitment Strategy was created to help Aboriginal youth that have dropped out of school to re-engage in learning, whether it is a traditional school setting, alternative sources of learning, life skills programs or vocational programming. The partnership between Calgary Board of Education and USAY allows us to recruit Aboriginal youth who are hoping to return to school and seamlessly transition them back into a system that supports their success.Aboriginal Youth Mentorship Program (AYMP)Mentoring plays a key role for Aboriginal youth success in school and eventual high school completion. The AYMP program creates three tiers of mentoring within one program - adults, teens and children:Adults mentor teensThe same teens mentor childrenThis model allows those youth at-risk in high school gain role modeling and mentoring from an adult, and they receive leadership skills by becoming a mentor and role model to a child.Aboriginal Anti-Racism Movement Program (AARM)AARM is a weekly meeting for youth to challenge their beliefs and the attitudes of others through the use of creative mediums. By providing opportunities for participants to practice and develop skills that promote self-esteem and self-confidence, AARM aims to help deconstruct the walls of racism that are all too prevalent in society.AARM is an intensive program. It is not meant to reach a large amount of youth in a small way, but rather a small group of youth in a meaningful, positive way.Aboriginal Student Achievement Program (ASAP)The ASAP program creates an incentive for youth to be successful in school. The program provides participants with a series of small financial rewards for increases in academic grades during the academic year, up to a maximum of $1,000 per year.Aboriginal Youth International TripThis project provides an international learning experience for Aboriginal youth that have been in active in USAYs programs for three or more consecutive years. In most cases, youth that attend this international opportunity have successfully graduated from high school and are transitioning from USAYs programming into post-secondary or employment. USAY utilizes this experience as a farewell and congratulations for overcoming their barriers and having long-term success.Back Pack Giveaway USAY Backpack Giveaway provides 300 Aboriginal children and youth in Calgary with backpacks and all the back-to-school supplies they need to make their school year an enjoyable and affordable one. The backpacks have all the necessary school supplies including:binders  paperpencilspenshighlightersscissorsgeometry setsgluepencil crayonsrulersChristmas Hampers USAYs Christmas Hampers provide families with supports during the holiday season. USAY staff work hard to fill the hampers with a considerable amount of groceries, and gifts for the children. Examples of hamper items have included:non-perishablesgift cards for groceries and gastransit ticketspersonalized gifts for childrenbasic kitchen and household itemshygiene itemsdiapersSpecial Editions of New Tribe MagazinePublishing Special Editions of New Tribe Magazine allows USAY and its team of contributors to focus on a topic or issue that is important to both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal communities. Allowing an entire edition to be dedicated to one topic allows for unspoken stories to be told, critical information to be shared and complex questions to be asked. These editions promote open dialogue and raise awareness about important issues. Examples of previous Special Editions include; the Indian Residential School System and discrimination and human rights.Blackfoot Graphic Novel This program supports USAYs larger language initiative, which strives to increase the number of Blackfoot speakers among urban Aboriginal youth. By developing youth friendly language tools, such as the Blackfoot Graphic Novels, USAY is working to encourage youth to embrace the Blackfoot language and play an active role in preservation and revitalization.Blackfoot Language eLearning Centre USAY has two free Blackfoot eLearning Courses on our website. Traditional language courses help instill and develop cultural awareness and pride among Aboriginal youth.","USAY has a group of 12 youth that weve had in our programs for the past four years. Thankfully theyve all recently graduated from high school and are now transitioning out of our programs; it is time for them to leave the nest as one would say. To celebrate their huge accomplishments we are taking them on a marine conservation volunteer experience in Mexico.The majority of the trip was made possible by USAYs many donations and supporters over the past few years, but we need some additional funds to better support the youth in making them feel comfortable (basic swimwear, snorkeling equipment, luggage, etc.) and the outstanding cost of flights. We are asking that if you have anyone that might be interested in donating that you send them either link for more information.The mission of this international trip is to increase our youths cultural understanding and awareness of global issues as well as to equip them with the knowledge and ability to further contribute towards key local issues in other Indigenous, areas while obtaining critical Canadian Aboriginal identity.

"242",776,"Valour Canada","What is Canadas role in the world? What is our responsibility to protect those unable to protect themselves and safeguard human rights both at home and beyond our borders? What are the consequences of action or inaction? What have we done in the past? What are the lessons to be learned? How have these actions shaped our lives today and our expectations for the future? How do we measure the worth of the sacrifice?These questions are fundamental and generate important discussions and debate that are the very essence of democracy.Conflict rages. The world is in turmoil. The causes are complex: territorial, religious, imperial expansion, historical grievances and long standing disputes. We have felt the consequences within our borders. Yet are we are failing to prepare our youth, the countrys future leaders, to lead Canada? How will they make informed decisions if they lack the basic knowledge about military history, heritage and traditions. To understand the experiences that shaped and influenced our foreign policy, humanitarian, diplomatic and military. History guides and shapes the debate about our future at home and abroad. Our goal is to lead the discussion. To engage our youth to think critically about the world, and the nation they will one day lead. To insure they possess the knowledge to confidentially exercise this responsibility and the courage to make informed decisions.Knowledge of Canadas military history is imperative in a democracy where we, the citizens, ultimately make the life and death decision to send our forces in harms way. It explains why we made the decisions we did and at the cost. Our past successes and failures enable us to make better decisions in the future.The service and sacrifice of the brave men and women who have so proudly worn the maple leaf reminds us of who we are, what we believe, the great things we have done and the mistakes we have made. They are Canadas best and their story is our story!It is our responsibility as parents and as a community of concerned citizens to insure our youth understand their military history and heritage and equip them to think critically about Canadas role in the world with the hope of shaping a better future.----Our Impact in 2014-----a year of unprecedented growth for education programming; thenumber of student and teacher participants grew by 57%.Our greatest challenge is to balance an expanding program with fiscal sustainability.Over 2 days in April and May and 6 days in November and December 2014, over 1300 Calgaryand area senior high students gathered at The Military Museums to discuss, debate and deliberate overoptions for Canada (humanitarian, diplomatic, and military) in regards to the Islamic State (IS)conflict.the launch of the inauguralJunior High School, held over 2 days withover 250 students from 3 Calgary and areaschools.

So we can fully understand and appreciate what it means to be Canadian both at home and around the world.Our Mission is to connect Canadians to their proud military history and heritage. The values associated include human rights; safety and security, the rule of law and the democratic values of free speech and elected government.It is about citizenship. For over one hundred years, the Canadian forces have served our nation at home and abroad. They have liberated the oppressed, defeated tyranny and restored peace and security, health and hope. We are a trusted ally and respected peace broker. Our forces proudly wear the maple leaf wherever they go. Yet, as a nation, many of us are unaware of our military history or are ill informed about our current involvement?It is about what it means to be Canadian, what we value as a nation, what we are willing to defend? Born out of a desire to create a unique identity, for over one hundred years Canadians have fought for the values we hold true. Our forces have liberated the oppressed, defeated tyranny and restored peace and security, health and hope at home and abroad. We are a trusted ally and respected peace broker.... But do Canadians today know this? We believe Canadians are proud of their history and want to learn more. Our mission is to insure they do.

"244",393,"Verb Theatre Society","I often think that some of the most powerful theatrical experiences Ive had over the years are the ones I didnt see coming, the ones I didnt know I needed to see until I saw them. The ones that surprised me. As a director, I still enjoy those surprises from inside a project (thankfully!) and this is what I love about what we offer at Verb. You may not know what to expect at a Verb show, but you can expect the unexpected. You can be sure well surprise you.In 2012, we embarked on a bit of an ambitious project called NOISE: A Musical for Deaf and Hearing Audiences. In a sentence, our goal had been to create a show that both Deaf and hearing audiences could enjoy and experience equally and simultaneously, without the aid of sign language interpreters or translators. In another sentence, we wanted to experiment with what Deaf performance could offer traditional theatre performance. For example, we turned sign-language poetry into both dance and song so that both hearing and Deaf audiences could access the meaning.The show was a lot of things  wild, experimental, complex, innovative  but the thing that always sticks with me about this show was the audience response to our approach to the show. Some people loved it, some people hated it, some people (for better or worse) were brought to tears. What was cool, though, was that most people were surprised by it.Whats more, half of these people were Deaf and half were hearing, and by attending the show, they were able to see the world through the others eyes for a bit. One mother commented that this was the first time shed been able to attend a performance with her Deaf daughter, and though I didnt know enough sign language to understand their conversation, they left the theatre with hands excitedly buzzing over their shared experience at our show.Knowing that weve offered something to someone that they didnt know they needed is the fuel that keeps our fire lit here at Verb.","Since 2008, Verb Theatre has served Calgary a variety of theatrical dishes designed to explore whats important at that that moment for our community and beyond. The way we express this varies from year to year, show to show, but at the heart of our programming lies an interest in tapping into conversations and ideas that we think matter today and will matter even more to you tomorrow.WE CHALLENGE THE FORMIn the age of our dearly beloved Netflix, it has become clear that theatre can still offer many things that no computer screen can. At Verb, were always exploring the modes of performance that serve todays theatre goers and maybe, more importantly, tomorrows. Over the years weve used our stage in amazing ways: non-linear structures to help an audience see the world through the eyes of an early-onset Alzheimers patient; sign-language-based song and dance to help bring Deaf and hearing audiences together; documentary theatre to bring a personal touch to the Physician Assisted Dying debate; participatory theatre; hyper minimalism; site-specific performance, and more. We believe that the live stage has much to offer in an age where so much is digital, and a key tenant of our mission is to find and share with you the theatre of the 21st century.WE INSPIRE CONVERSATIONIdeas have a way of entering in and out of the collective societal conversation in waves, and at Verb, we surf at the front of these waves. For example, we created a documentary theatre project about Doctor Assisted Dying a year before the issue re-entered the supreme court, and were thrilled to continue contributing to that conversation as the topic made its way to the headlines. Each play we create or produce is specifically chosen for the way it contributes to or even incites a conversation that we think is important, interesting, and imminent. PROFESSIONAL AND INCLUSIVEWe hire professional artists to help us connect with the community at large. Many of our shows have been created with the support of community organizations that help us reach new audiences and even introduce us to individuals whose voices become part of the shows we create. Our professional artists have been critically celebrated and our award-winning teams are regularly recognized through awards and nominations at the Calgary Theatre Critics Awards and the Betty Mitchell Professional Theatre Awards. Visit verbtheatre.com to learn about the ways our work has been celebrated.","PREMIERES OF NEW (AND NEW-TO-US) PLAYSEach year, we produce a play that is brand new to Calgary, to Alberta, to Canada, or even to the world! Some of these are important plays from across the globe that we just need to share with Calgary (like our 2015 production of Lungs by UK playwright Duncan MacMillan) and some are of our own creation, like our world premiere of Jim Forgetting by Verbs own Col Cseke.In the 2015/16 season, we are proud to present the world premiere of a work thats been in development here at Verb for a few years, ever since a local actor/athlete approached us with an idea about creating a play that uses Mixed Martial Arts as a performance vocabulary.    THE FIGHT OR FLIGHT RESPONSE by Col Cseke will punch, kick, and bite its way to the stage in March 2016. Featuring Justin Michael Carriere and Nathan Pronyshyn, both trained MMA athletes who also happen to be professional actors, this show is sure to be one of the most physically rigorous and electric shows youll ever see. This show explores, jabs, and bobs around themes of masculinity, violence, and control.NEW PLAY DEVELOPMENTSome of the work we want to see on Calgary stages just doesnt exist yet, so we get to build it! In the past, weve developed new plays over the course of two or three years before it sees a public audience. For the future, we are building new structures of play development formally into our programming.In 2015/16, we are thrilled to announce two new initiatives:PROFESSIONAL COMMISSION  In September, 2015, we announced a call for proposals from professional playwrights who are interested in creating the kind of work we do at Verb. Over the coming years, this playwright and their work will receive financial and production support from Verb as we encourage Canadian playwrights to explore new forms and modes of performance. We hope to produce this playwrights work in a coming season.EXPERIMENT LAB  In September, 2015, we also announced our that 2015/16 will see Verb supporting artists in-studio with our experiment labs, designed to help artists working through creative questions and hypotheses for creating work for the 21st century. These labs will offer artists financial assistance, rehearsal space, and time to play with a creative concept before taking it to the stage. We hope that this lab will light up some diamonds in the rough that will shine in a future Verb season.","Join in the fun!

"245",440,"Vivo (Cardel Place) - CRA: Nose Creek Sports&Rec","We registered our daughter in Vivos Child + Youth Action Research Project as a simple exercise in getting her more active and exposing her to a variety of different sports and activities. At first it was a struggle  cajoling, negotiating and pushing her to attend the twice-weekly classes. Gradually though, we noticed her excitement increase as her self-confidence began to blossom. As her fitness level and hand-eye coordination improved, so did her keenness to attend the sessions. Not only was she affected physically, but her greater belief in herself improved her willingness to share and socialize with other participants and her instructors. As a result, weve witnessed the emergence of a better-quality relationship with her brothers and sister at home and a willingness to put herself out there and try new things. Now, our once shy reticent child is registered in a variety of programs for the fall and has planned a full slate of engaging outdoor activities over the summer.~ Ayman, PARENTActive families create vibrant communities. Healthy adults are more innovative and productive employees. Happy individuals are more engaged citizens. They combine to ensure that every generation has the chance to live a healthy life, which in turn contributes to decreasing the crippling demands on Albertas healthcare system.The benefits of every generation enjoying a healthy life are real and measureable. In October 2014 The Conference Board of Canada forecast that getting just 10% of Canadians to moderately increase their physical activity and decrease sedentary time will increase Canadas GDP by $7.5 billion and lower health care costs by $2.6 billion by 2040[1].To realize these benefits, and to keep Calgary one of the best places to live and work, we need change in our communities at the grassroots level where children, youth and families live, learn, work and play. We must think and act differently, moving beyond health promotion to empower and educate Albertans to live healthy, active lives. The question is where do we begin?[1]Conference Board of Canada October 2014 Report -http://www.conferenceboard.ca/press/newsrelease/14-10-23/moving_a_little_more_goes_a_long_way_report_finds.aspx.","Vivois working to create made-in-Alberta solutions to this provincial and national challenge. The organization operates a self-sustaining regional recreation centre in north-central Calgary, one of the most diverse and rapidly growing communities. Vivo has over 1.2 million visits annually. Our goals:Raise healthier generations by helping more children, youth and their families be more healthy, active and less sedentary;Strengthen our community by engaging key partners in a vision to build a stronger, safer and healthier community for all; andCreate new evidence-based blueprints for Canadas public recreation sector demonstrating the sectors immense potential to create healthy, active and vibrant communities across the country.To accomplish these goals we are catalyzing collective leadership by engaging partners to create an evidence-based change system aligning schools, recreation and other community assets to achieve better health outcomes. Together with Mount Royal University (MRU), weve launched a new upstream collaboratory, Canadas first community-driven, community-based action research centre focused on empowering Canadians to live healthier lives across their lifespan.The collaboratory was introduced at our October 2014 Raise the Bar Leadership Roundtable, where Premier Jim Prentice, federal cabinet minister Michele Rempel and organizations from across diverse sectors underscored the value of this innovative and collaborative work and signalled their intent to join in solving Albertas, and Canadas, systemic challenge of physical inactivity and sedentary behaviour.Were working with a range of diverse partners in helping individuals and communities get more active and healthy.

Our goal is to create awareness and provide education on the benefits of unstructured play, and work with communities to increase overall capacity for play.

"246",284,"Volunteer Airdrie Society","My name is Ryan, Im 15 and I go to St Martin De Pores. I have been actively volunteering for 6 years through associations like Volunteer Airdrie, Ronald McDonald House, Airdrie Boys and Girls Club and Brown Bagging for Calgarys kids.The first time I volunteered I was 8. My mom brought me to an event at her Gap store, we were selling hot dogs and hamburgers to raise money for their lunch program with Brown Bagging for Calgarys Kids. I spent my day asking people if they wanted to buy a lunch, and how one lunch for them equaled 5 lunches for kids in our schools.Back then helping other people wasnt the reason I volunteered, I volunteered because it wasfun and I was hanging out with my family. Which in my opinion is the biggest reason for youthto start volunteering. Even for myself - only until recently did I look at volunteering as not only away to have fun but to help people.Once I hit the 7th grade I started volunteering on my own, mainly with my school. My best friend Justin and I were the tech leads in our student council at OLQP. Every day wed volunteer our lunch hours and spare time where we ran our school We Day Program, built a school in Haiti and much more. I am proud to say we ended up raising over 10 000 dollars as a student council to build a school. Because of my volunteering at school I was nominated for the Junior Leaders of Tomorrow Award by my Vice Principal.My family and I were invited to the Propellus Gala dinner where I was recognized for myvolunteering. The part I remember most about the evening was meeting fellow award winnersand hearing their volunteer story. And how it felt to tell my own.Only until recently has volunteering for me turned into helping people whilehaving fun - instead of having fun while helping people. Even if the difference between the two mayseem small, it is actually massive and here is why.When a person is having fun while helping people; they are volunteering to have fun and theyjust end up helping and its as simple as that.But when a person realizes that they can actually help people while having fun, they will findthe true meaning of volunteering.----Volunteers are needed in every community in an informal capacity, like helping your neighbours, and formal capacities to keep organizations up and running. According to the City of Airdries Social Needs Assessment survey in 2014, only 32% of Airdrians currently volunteer, compared to 47% nationally and 55% provincially.","We promote lifelong volunteerism, raise awareness of the power of service, educate, and inform people about opportunities to serve through volunteerism. We build the capacity for effective local volunteering by providing organizations with resources and training in volunteer management. Therefore, Volunteering Airdrie contributes to the vitality and quality of life of the community and provides individuals with opportunities for personal growth and development through volunteering.Our Mission: Encouraging, advocating and promoting volunteerism resulting in a healthier and more successful community.Our Vision:Strengthening our community through volunteerism.----For every 1% increase in volunteer participation, our communitys social programs receive the equivalent of $1.3 million to $2.1 million of social capital investment, which is the estimated value of the 86,000 hours per year of time that an additional 550 volunteers provide.Also, the volunteers benefit from community involvement, as many studies have shownimproved physical, mental and social welfare is correlated to volunteerism. These preventive benefits directly impact and reduce the demands on our provincial healthcare system, social services  unemployment safety nets and law enforcement costs.","We encourage informal and formal volunteering among people of all ages, especially families and youth, in order to strengthen our community. We attend community events and complete presentations in schools in order to provide information regarding the benefits of volunteering and the opportunities that are available in our community.We provide organizations with resources and training in volunteer management in order to improve their volunteer programs and the opportunity to utilize our volunteer recruitment assistance. We post their volunteer opportunities on our website, post about the opportunity on our various social media platforms, market their opportunities at our table at events, and direct potential volunteers who contact us to these organizations that have volunteer positions that are appropriate for the volunteer.The Benefits of Volunteering:If youre one of the 13.3 million Canadians who volunteer, you may already know that volunteering is as beneficial to you as it is to the causes you care the most about. If not, here are ten reasons to volunteer:Volunteering is good for your mental health.Volunteering is good for your physical health.Volunteering is good for your self-confidence.Volunteering can fight depression.Volunteering expands your social network.Volunteering can help you develop new skills.Volunteering can help you put existing skills to work.Volunteering can advance your career.Volunteering can expose you to new career options.Volunteering can make a difference in causes that are important to you.","We challenge YOU to make the difference in 2015!

"247",724,"W.P. Puppet Theatre Society","Once upon a time, two little girls named Wendy and Pam crawled into their attic to create puppets from popsicle sticks and cardboard, making epics like the semi-autobiographical - Hood the Horrible.Inspired by these childhood memories, Founding and Artistic Director, Wendy Passmore-Godfrey BFA, established WPTS as a charitable, not-for-profit society based in Calgary, Alberta in 1991.At WP Puppet Theatre (WPTS), we seek to spark curiosity; provide understanding about the world we live in; examine the issues of our time; consider solutions and inspire our audiences to become active, ethical and involved citizens through puppetry.Puppets bring joy, supply a creative outlet, help diverse groups of people to better understand each other, promote diversity, exercise tolerance and provide a creative platform to express controversial and significant social issues.The performance exceeded expectations. Such a simple design filled with imagination galore. (Audience member)","The Arts are one of the most effective ways to learn.Here are some of the ways puppets have impacted our audience:During a student performance, Amar, a selective mute student, found the courage to say his line in front of 500 people with the help of his puppet.In a youth at risk class, students who normallystruggle to engage in class subjects,became completelyimmersedin carving marionettes.Kids will flat out copy our child-friendly performance puppets to create their own characters,tell their own stories andexpress their ideas(Were obviously flattered!).Parents who remember seeing us as children now bring their ownkids to experience our shows.

Here is how we have combined artistic quality and story telling:We push the definition and challenge perceptions of what puppetry is by integrating other art genres such as installation, performance art, video and public art.We ensureour art is accessible for young audiences to try it themselves.We are proud to state that we dont do cookie cutter work, we dont dumb it down, and we dont exploit our art form or ouraudiences.Our programming includes:SCHOOL PROGRAMSWP Puppet Theatre Society has been offeringperformances,workshops,residencies, andprofessionaldevelopmentfor schools and communities since 1991.

"248",615,"Wellspring Calgary","No one has to face cancer alone.From the moment you walk through the door, theres just an overwhelming feeling of knowing youre safe, youre not alone, youre with people who totally get it. Wellspring Calgary helped me to climb out of hopelessness. I learned how to take charge of my situation and reach a place of peace and acceptance out of hopelessness... I cannot express in mere words how much this means to me. It has meant my life.A cancer diagnosis can be devastating. It brings countless life-altering moments and events for people who receive the diagnosis and for those who love them. People with cancer are compelled to find a new normal before, during, and after treatment. Priorities shift, relationships change, life is... different.At Wellspring, people living with cancer tell us what helps them the most - having access to information, receiving support, and learning new ways to cope. They also tell us the cancer journey has two roads: medical and emotional.Albertans have excellent medical resources to fight cancer, but people who have cancer need so much more than medical care. Individuals and their loved ones often have difficulty finding the emotional, psychological and practical support they so urgently require.In Calgary, only Wellspring devotes itself exclusively to the unique non-medical needs that cancer presents. The Wellspring Calgary community of support provides a vital complement to medical treatment. Wellspring helps heal the body, mind, and spirit. It is a place where people with cancer, their families and friends can exchange information, develop a support system and create a sense of hope, in a warm, caring and welcoming atmosphere.The beautiful, uplifting surroundings make Wellspring Calgary accessible and extraordinary. Programs and services take place at two locations. In the north, Carma House, a warm and welcoming 4500 square foot home, nestled in trees on a lot meters from the Bow River. Large windows provide views of hills across the water and tranquil woods, and it is minutes from the walking paths by the river. In October 2016, a second leased location opened behind the Blackfoot Inn. Ample parking and a welcoming environment provide easier access to the same programs for those living in south Calgary and area.Wellspring charges no fees. Programs are available free to anyone coping with any type of cancer at any stage. Programs include individual and group support, coping skills, expressive therapies, energy work, educational workshops and presentations. A lending resource library provides a range of information on the social, emotional and psychological aspects of cancer.Wellspring receives no core government or United Way funding. Programs and operations are made possible through the generous donations of our community.To understand how our programs make a difference - see some of Wellspring members comments on our YOUTUBE channel.","OUR MISSION | Wellspring Calgary is a warm and welcoming community that provides a comprehensive range of support, resources and programs so anyone living with cancer and the people who care about them can improve the quality of their lives.OUR VISION | No one has to face cancer alone.Wellspring Calgary addresses the body-mind-spirit needs that result from a cancer diagnosis and its treatment. For those diagnosed, their caregivers and loved ones. We provide over 26,000 hours of program delivery and resources annually at no charge to our members. We currently have a membership of over 4,000 people, welcoming over 500 people annually through our doors. We are supported by 175 volunteers who donate over 10,000 hours of volunteer time annually.OUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS | The Calgary Stampede Western Legacy Awards recognized Wellspring Calgary founders for Innovation (see story from Calgary Herald). This award recognizes a person or group creating a single visionary project that speaks to western values. We are included in the orientation at Tom Baker Cancer Centre for those newly diagnosed.WHAT WE DO | Wellspring Calgary is a unique resource that responds to a specific, recognized and growing need which had been unmet until we opened our doors: the need for resources and support that address the social, emotional and other practical needs people face when they are living with cancer. Helping people live as well as possible with cancer and respond to lifes challenges is what Wellspring Calgary does best. Staff, facilitators and volunteers understand the social, emotional and practical consequences of cancer and its treatments on those diagnosed and those who love them. Wellspring has a distinctive approach to the overall support of individuals: helping people to restore the dignity and control they so often lose when faced with a cancer diagnosis, offering a community of support, a safe place where people can connect with others who understand this journey.Patients for whom emotional distress remains unresolved are five times more likely to use community health services, twice as likely to visit emergency departments, more likely to receive expensive third- and fourth-line chemotherapy and place higher demands on scarce provider time. Emotional and psychological support programs save healthcare resources. [Dr. Margaret Fitch, head, Oncology Nursing and Supportive Care, Odette cancer Centre, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre.  Supportive Care Rebalancing Efforts pp 144-145.]WHAT IS NEEDED | We know that our current medical system cannot support all needs of all people currently living with cancer. One in two Albertans will face cancer in their lifetime; of the two, the other one will be supporting the one diagnosed, so both will be living with cancer. Annually nearly 16,000 Albertans will be diagnosed with cancer  about 43 people each day. Of those diagnosed, 10,000 will survive their cancer and may request access to programs, resources and support that will improve the quality of their lives during and after their treatment. Wellspring Calgary is a vital support. Working synergistically with our medical colleagues and other cancer-related organizations, Wellspring Calgary can uniquely respond to the unmet and important needs of those living with cancer.Our programs and resources provide the opportunity for individuals to explore health, nutrition, exercise, mindfulness and much more. Members often express the benefit of Wellspring Calgary, not only in their own life, but describe it as being influential within their family, workplace, and community.","Wellspring Calgary provides programs under specific pillars of support:Core / Educational (Brain Fog, Returning to Work, Healing Journey, Money Matters, public Speaker Series sessions)Movement  Meditation (Yoga, Tai Chi, Dance, Exercise, Visualization, Mindful Mountain Hiking)Expressive Arts (storytelling in all artistic mediums: creative arts, oral, written, music, photography, film-making)Caregiving / Self Care (peer support, care for the caregiver, Thursdays with Bob Glasgow)Programs are both drop-in (limited) and pre-registered.

The sense of community and the strength people derive from fellowship and friendship is a key factor in our group programs. With one in two Albertans facing a cancer diagnosis in their lifetime, Wellspring Calgary can be a crucial step in the journey. Through our centre of support, we provide programs supporting the body, mind, and spirit. We address the psycho-social and emotional aspects of a cancer diagnosis, provide benefits from practical supports in response to needs arising outside of the medical realm, and help people cope (individually and as families) with their diagnosis and beyond treatment.

"249",578,"WinSport (formerly known as Calgary Olympic Development Association, or CODA)","WinSport inspires human potential through the spirit of sport. We provide opportunities for Canadians to lead healthy, active lives by providing world-class facilities and programming for people of all ages and abilities. We deliver our mission through a model that embodies helping people discover, develop and excel in sport.The Discover part introduces people to sport; the Develop portion helps young athletes make the transition to become high performance athletes and Excel involves helping athletes of the highest caliber train to reach the podium.Tracy and Allen registered their son and daughter into several of our programs over the last couple of years as a way to introduce them to sport while also allowing them to gain life-long skills. After seeing the positive changes in their two children, the family felt compelled to write the following letter.I am writing to you regarding your summer camp programs and your ski and snowboard lessons. This letter should have come last season, but nevertheless, I feel even more compelled to write this after my childrens experience this year at their summer camps. My kids have participated in many activities and programs at WinSport over the past few years.Theyve taken skating lessons and ski/snowboard lessons and during the summer months and participated in your mountain bike camps, sport  adventure camps and a hockey camp. Every single camp has been exceptional! My kids come home tired (which is a good thing) and happy. They talk about all the exciting things theyve done throughout the day and how great all of their instructors/leaders have been. My children have had so many leaders and instructors at WinSport that have made such an impact on their love of sport and their desire to try new things. My son cannot wait for winter to come so he can do another snowboard lesson! My daughter is sad that her summer camp is over and cant wait until next summer! For this reason, I must mention some of the amazing staff you have employed.My daughter, Paige, had amazing bike camp instructors over the past two years who had such an impact on Paige. Paiges confidence soared and the instructor was so much fun for the girls in her group. Paige also had a wonderful caring leader in her Sport  Adventure camp this year  her name is Alicia.My daughter told me today that the worst part about her camp ending was leaving Alicia! This speaks volumes! Carson was my sons snowboard instructor last year. Zach, my son, took level 1 and 2 preschool snowboard lessons. Now, he cant get enough of it! He still often talks about Carson and hopes that he gets him this season for level 3. Carson was an amazing role model for my son. He instilled such a love of the sport and we couldnt thank him enough! This summer, Zach had a wonderful biking camp leader who was so patient and caring. He built up Zachs confidence and because of that, my son now also has a love for biking.I just wanted to let you know that we are so happy with your facility, programs and staff. You have a first class facility and we absolutely enjoy every moment experiencing it. I want to thank your staff that my children had an amazing time this summer and that they cant wait to come back and take part in many other programs.","The dictionary defines perseverance as steadfastness in doing something despite difficulty or delay in achieving success. Our team at WinSport helps people pick themselves up after they fall or helps build their confidence after they finish in fourth place  all so they learn to persevere. This allows them to gain mastery, improve confidence and establish enduring friendships through sport. It also allows them to simply enjoy the benefits of the changing seasons and amazing geography that surrounds us. We believe in being better than yesterday.It started for us in the early 1960s. The community gathered on our small hill to strap on planks of wood to learn how to ski and take advantage of the Rocky Mountains in our own backyard. Even back then, among the falls and tumbles, you could hear the laughter and the distinctive slap of a high five when the young and young at heart got up on their skis for the first time or mastered their parallel turns. The willingness to get up and try again is what defines us as Calgarians. As the hill started to grow up, a group of leaders passionate about sport got together with the ambition to put our hill on the world stage by bidding to host the Winter Olympic Games. After a few failed attempts, these leaders dusted themselves off and eventually won the bid to welcome the world to our small ski hill in 1988. These Games were filled with stories of challenge and perseverance, such as Eddie the Eagle soaring to new heights or the fledgling Jamaican bobsleigh team, who after flipping their sled in the Kreisel, persevered to the finish line to cap off an amazing run at their first ever Winter Olympic Games.These stories of pushing to be better, despite not hitting the podium yet achieving so much, galvanized our purpose here at WinSport. We are here to help people activate and reach their potential through the spirit of sport. Since that time, our organization and our campus have grown. Through continued investment and our push to be better, we are focused on developing the whole person. This does not simply mean mastering sport  it means simultaneously building the mental, physical and social skills of our participants. Through our experience, there is lot to be learned from trying something new  failing and trying again, or achieving a personal best. We have introduced people to sport across our campus and have provided the guidance and abilities to push them to their personal podiums across the globe. Many see it as a ski lesson, skate lesson or a week of summer camp. We see it as an opportunity to instil valuable life skills to enable people to have a positive impact on their family, friends and the community as a whole. At WinSport, we believe we are here to teach others how they can be better than yesterday.A Year in Review - In 2015, WinSport:introduced more than 30,000 people to sport through ski and snowboard lessons, summer camps, mountain bike camps and hockey, ringette and learn to skate camps (including visits by more than 20,000 school kids from 150 different schools);was able to secure one of the top chefs in Western Canada, with the addition of Liana Robberecht as the organizations new executive chef; andcontinued to be a key driver for physical literacy in the sport community through our Active Lives department.","As an Olympic venue that operates year round, we are able to offer an eclectic array of activities, programming, camps and lessons in which 1.2 million Calgarians participate in each year.

She was struggling to build a career in a new country where she had little work experience. She also lacked the computer skills necessary for many jobs. And without a stable income, she found herself without access to many of the basic needs items we all need to feel stable, secure and confident.Winnie stopped by the Erin Woods Family Resource Centre in the hopes of making improvements in her life. She wanted to find a job and learn about resources available in her community. She also wanted to make positive changes for herself, her family and her neighbourhood.Through WINS, Winnie received a Free Goods Referral for free clothing from our thrift stores, help with her resume, access to computer courses, and assistance applying for jobs. Her WINS Family Resource Centre Facilitator, Nadima, even helped her get a washer and dryer for her home. According to Winnie, every problem she came to WINS with, she was able to get help finding solutions.I feel safe and happy knowing that there is an office in my neighborhood that if I ever have any problem I can go to Nadima and talk to her and get help.Winnie soon began volunteering with WINS as she continued working to gain more job skills training. I want to encourage and support other women. Even though my situation isnt good, I have to give back to my community. It is also important for me to role model this for my kids, to be a good member of the community and to give back.Winnie also knows first hand what type of programming will help and inspire other women living in her neighbourhood. In fact, thanks to one of Winnies great ideas, WINS now runs its successful Coffee Time program in many of its Family Resource Centres, bringing women in the community together to gain social skills and build networks of support.For our clients, WINS is a place where they can gain the skills and supports to achieve self-sufficiency. For WINS, our clients like Winnie are a constant source of inspiration and ideas - ideas that can help us help even more women in need and their families.","In the mid-80s, Catherine Tkach was living in a rehabilitation facility after having survived years in an abusive relationship and struggling with an addiction as a result. She needed clothing and all that was available was dirty and sitting in garbage bags in a basement room. Catherine knew then what she wanted to do with her life: create a space where women who were struggling could get what they needed in an environment where they had dignity and choice. Thus, the Women In Need Society (WINS) was born.Today, our stores serve Calgarians at all socio-economic levels and fund 85 per cent of our programs available to women in need and their families. Partnering with more than 80 Calgary agencies, we provide marginalized women and their families with access to free basic need items, skill-building, social and goal based programs. We also partner with local agencies to offer entry level employment opportunities for those new to Canada, those needing work experience and those struggling to find employment elsewhere.As Calgary faces a declining economic climate, the reality is that:One in 10 of our neighbours live in povertyOne in five are children under the age of fiveA single mother, employed full-time earning minimum wage with a three-year-old child experiences a monthly deficit of $203.00 and an annual deficit of $2,436.0070 per cent of families earning less than $30,000 annually worry about their ability to afford basic needs21,000 children under the age of 18 are living in low-income households68.8 per cent of low-wage workers 26 years or older are womenWINS understands that in order to break cycles of poverty, people need access to the basic needs required to provide for their families as well as access to the social networks so crucial for maintaining mental and physical health. Thats why our programs and services are constantly evolving.Over the past several years, weve seen an increased demand for our programs and services. To meet the increasing need, we opened three additional Family Resource Centre locations and expanded our Free Goods Referral Program to include free delivery of furniture and large household items to the women we serve.In 2016 alone, over $624,000 in Free Goods Referrals were issued to women in need and their families and more than13,000 adults and5,000 children received critical support through WINS programs at our Family Resource Centres. This is a 40% increase over 2015 numbers.ANNUAL HIGHLIGHTS (2015):Our Community Programs felt the impact of the economic downturn. We saw many new faces in our Family Resource Centres (FRCs); in fact, attendance at our programs doubled from 2014.With donors, Calgarians, community partners and funders, we created hope and new beginnings for 1,800individuals supported by our six Family ResourceCentres;$483,506 given in freeclothing, housewares,and furniture in our Free GoodsReferral Program; and88%of clients at our Family Resource Centres noted that weve helped them believe they can take care of themselves; andWe received national attention as winner of the 2015 Trico Social EnterPrize Award; and we diverted 992,700 lbs from landfill through our recycling programs.Our Board fully supports our priorities of strengthening our socialenterprise operations so that we have more to investin our programs, building our brand and profile in thecommunity, and striving to ensure WINS remains agreat place to work for our team.","Each year, we help thousands of local women in need and their families through three key programs:Family Resource Centres: WINS operates six Family Resource Centres in subsidized housing complexes across the city. Our centres provide families in need with a space to come together, share, and learn information and skills to move them towards self-empowerment and self-sufficiency. In 2016 our Family Resource Centres provided more than20,000 services to individuals and families in need, a 68.5% increase over 2015, highlighting the need for WINS services in Calgary.WINS Thrift Store Social Enterprise: Through the generous donations of individuals and corporations, our four retail thrift stores sell affordable goods with all revenues supporting our programs and services for women in need and their families. Our stores also provide employment and work experience opportunities for those new to Canada, those returning to the workforce, and those who may not be able to find employment elsewhere.Free Goods Referral Program (FGRP): WINS actively partners with more than 60 local agencies who refer women in need of clothing, housewares and furniture to set up and maintain a home for their families but have limited means to do so. These women are low-income single mothers, newcomers to Canada, women coming out of crisis situations and women in transition. Through the FGRP, our clients receive vouchers to use toward items in our thrift stores. Rather than simply providing our clients with these items, we empower our clients to choose what they need.","At WINS, we understand that not everyone is in a position to make a large financial donation, but there are so many other ways you can help us ensure we are able to continue providing programs and serivces to women in need and their families.Donate Gently Used or New Goods: WINS gratefully accepts a wide variety of gently used and new items to be sold in our stores and offered free of charge to women in need through ourFree Goods Referral Program.

"251",752,"Women's Centre of Calgary","The Womens Centre has helped me with food and other items and with information. Its helped make a difference by making life a little easier because I currently have no home or income at the moment and it gives me a place to go, think, and get stuff arranged.The Womens Centre is a safe space where all women are welcome to grab a cup of coffee, chat with others and learn about the many ways women, staff and volunteers all work together to strengthen our communities.In 2016, we responded to more than 100,000 contacts from women in Calgary. From employed women who cannot afford bus tickets to get to work, to mothers with small children needing emergency food hampers, to new immigrant women coming to our Practice English groups, we continue to support and connect women through our services.We are providing more basic needs assistance to women in need more than ever before. We are working to maintain a safe place for women to build community, to receive assistance and help in return as they are able. And we are facilitating opportunities for women to address the underlying causes of the situations they deal with.In 2015, we served a diverse community of women:52% are dealing with poverty21% are, or have been, homeless or living in a shelter38% are raising child(ren) or have raised child(ren) as a single parent40% are experiencing or have experienced a violent relationship","Every day, the Womens Centre provides a safe and supportive space accessed by hundreds of women in Calgary. While the Womens Centre is open to all women, many of the women who access our services are living in poverty.We believe in the potential of every woman, and that women are strong and capable. Our approach starts by recognizing that women are experts in their own lives, and they know best what they need. We also recognize that systemic barriers often prevent women from living the lives they want. Through our work for change initiatives, we advocate for systemic and policy changes that will positively impact the lives of women.Our trust-based work, supported by more than 690 active volunteers, is centered on a philosophy of women helping women. Enabling a woman to both get support and give back as she is able provides her with opportunities to feel valued and to maintain a sense of dignity and belonging. At the Womens Centre, every womans participation is equally respected and valued. We know that diverse participation is necessary for the community to benefit from the strengths and perspectives that women hold.Our Mission: To be every womans place for support, connections and community.Our Vision: Women supporting communities, communities supporting women.","Our programs are developed in response to identified gaps in the community and are flexible and responsive to womens changing needs.Basic Needs Access| We recognize that meeting basic needs is a prerequisite for well-being and for a better life. Some of the direct assistance we provide to women includes emergency food, bus tickets, birthday and holiday gifts for children, and access to personal supplies such as pregnancy kits, diapers and condoms. In addition, when women, and their children, visit the Centre, they offered hot drinks, baking and fresh fruit, free of charge. We also refer women to other programs and agencies for a wide range of support. Referrals include, but are not limited to food, clothing, furniture, housing, utilities, haircuts, and education and employment assistance.Computer and Technology Access| We provide women with free access to computers with internet, a photocopier, a fax machine, and telephones. Women use this equipment to prepare for work opportunities, to complete schoolwork and to stay connected with family and friends. We also provide a mail service for women without permanent mailing addresses and take telephone messages for women.Girl Power Programming | The Womens Centre offers Girl Power Camps in the spring and summer to mentor young girls (10-12) and promote basic values of equality, self-determination and empowerment. There is also an after school program on Tuesdays and Thursdays for girls 10-13 years old. The programs are free of charge with expenses such as transportation, meals, and supplies covered by the Centre.Legal Advice  Tax Clinics| Volunteers provide free legal advice and income tax clinics for women. Our legal advice clinics are aimed at providing women with the preliminary information and support they may need to access the legal system in the areas of family and non-family law. Volunteers who prepare taxes for women also provide information on how to access benefits such as GST rebates, Canada child tax benefit and provincial child benefits.Peer Support| Trained volunteers help women by listening, exploring options and providing non-therapeutic support, unique to each woman and circumstance. We also provide safety planning with women in potentially dangerous situations and we work with other agencies addressing violence.Social Issues Work| In addition to helping women meet their basic needs and create community, we strive to give all women opportunities to get involved in social justice issues and have a voice in public policy.Workshops  Groups| Every year, we offer more than 200 free informal adult education sessions ranging in topics from computer skills, yoga, parenting, and self-defense to international womens issues, crafts, stress management, and self-esteem.

"252",772,"Wood's Homes","What do you think of when you hear Street Services? Do you picture a shelter and people handing out steaming bowls of soup and cosy mittens in the winter?Id like to share Jacks story with you, and youll see that Street Services can and should be so much more.As a young boy, Jack watched as gambling and alcohol addictions consumed his father, Tim, whom he idolized and adored. His mother suffered years of emotional and physical abuse and finally found the courage to leave when Jack was 14, taking them far away to be sure Tim wouldnt follow.His mom, Leanne, had a hard time finding stable work, so they struggled with daily life in a tough neighbourhood in this city where they had no family or friends to fall back on.And then  just when they thought things couldnt get much worse, Leanne was diagnosed with lung cancer. Jack met a social worker during one of his daily visits to the hospital, but she could only offer a bus pass and a single food hamper during the 6 weeks before Leanne passed away. They had no savings, no life insurance, and the rent was overdue.Jack had nowhere to go, and no one to help him.He slept in stairways or in bushes; he found a blanket and camped close to others on the street. The constant pain of grief and despair Jack felt was dulled a little by the drugs someone offered him.Young people like Jack come to us at Woods Homes every day. They text us saying they are anxious and afraid...they walk through our doors at the Eastside Family Centre or EXIT Community Outreach hoping someone will listen...they are referred to one of our specialized programs after a crisis like a suicide attempt  thousands of children and teens over the course of a single year.Jack finally came to Woods, too. He lined up with a few others outside the EXIT Community Outreach doors on a bitterly cold morning, slipped into a chair in the corner and put his head down.I sat down next to him and told him my name was Patrick. I saw how scared he was to be there, and how utterly alone he felt.I offered him something to eat. Ducking his head, Jack quietly said, Yes, please.This is what we all think of, right? That those who are homeless come looking for a warm place to rest their head and some food to stave off the hunger?Jack did start off looking for food and warmth, and found that he could do laundry, have a shower, eat, and even get some warm socks. Woods Street Services offers these things because no one can ever heal if their basic needs are not met.But then, as Jack started to trust us, he also started to trust himself again. When I asked him if he might like to volunteer at one of our luncheons, he said he would.While we prepped for this lunch with some of the other volunteers who help out, Jack talked quietly about how his mom taught him to cook. Later, while he helped me serve the food he prepared, I saw a light in his eyes for the first time.Now it was time to ask Jack a question.

Our Street Services include counsellors, clinicians, job training, transitional housing, and all the advantages of having great relationships with other organizations.Sothe question. I asked if he might be interested in becoming a chef one day.Fear and excitement flashed in equal measure across his face. I could tell that he really wanted to say yes, so I reminded him that if he wanted to try, he wouldnt have to do it alone.Jack began his training in the culinary program with such hope, but then fell into a deep depression. Cooking reminded him so much of his mother, and how much he missed her.The Woods Youth Culinary Arts Program (YCAP) is special because it doesnt just get youth ready to work; it includes ongoing support from counsellors and access to clinicians. Jack was able to attend weekly therapy sessions to work through his grief, trauma and addiction while completing his training.The next time Jack came in to share what he cooked at the YCAP kitchen, we set up a meeting for him so he could look into finding a place to live. All this time hed still been sleeping on the streets, but now he was clean and working steadily at a restaurant downtown.He invited me to come with him when he got the keys to his apartment. When we got to the building, he gave me a hug, asked me to wait in the hall for a minute, and opened the door.He told me later that when he went out onto the balcony he said out loud: Mom, I did it. I have a job now. I have a home. And I feel like I might have me back, too.","We Never Say No. We Never Give Up.We Never Turn Anyone Away.We offer services to children and their families in Calgary, Lethbridge, Strathmore, Canmore, Fort McMurray and Fort Smith, N.W.T.

"253",510,"Wordfest","Wordfest was a fantastic way to get our students pumped about reading at the beginning of the year. After reading The Metro Dogs of Moscow by Rachelle Delaney and priming our students to meet the author, they were more excited than ever to participate in this field trip. It has made a lasting effect on the rest of the year, as the students are now eager to read and engage more meaningfully with text! Gabby Calder  TeacherAs an emerging Western Canadian writer, the Festival launched me into a prominence for which I could have only hoped and wished. Your Festival and its hard work to involve local and provincial media in coverage of local and out-of-town writers translated in my case into a nationally syndicated feature which appeared in major daily papers in nearly every large urban market. It would not have happened without the dedication and openness to new writers at WordFest JJ Lee, Wordfest 2011 AlumnusHISTORY| THE INITIAL SEED FOR WORDFEST WAS PLANTED IN 1995when The Banff Centre, interested in profiling its Writing and Publishing programs, sponsored the Hospitality Suite at The Vancouver International Writers Festival. Don Stein, then Associate Director, Planning for The Banff Centre, established a relationship with the Writers Guild of Alberta and a number of other interested parties, to explore the realities of establishing a Banff-Calgary International Writers Festival.Wordfest was established in 1996 as a project of The Banff Centre, Calgary Public Library, Mount Royal University and The Writers Guild of Alberta. The Banff Centre then approached respected arts professional Anne Green to develop the Festival and create an independent entity. The annual Festival would take place in October and feature international, national and local writers.Founding Festival Director Anne Greenprogrammed the first Wordfest, featuring 50 writers and two dozen events, taking place over four days. The 1996 line-up featured Margaret Atwood, Roch Carrier, Wayson Choy, Tomson Highway, Paul Quarrington and Sheri-D Wilson.Since then, Wordfest has presented many notable and world-renowned writers, such as Martin Amis, Margaret Atwood, Louis de Bernières, Joseph Boyden, Eleanor Catton, Wayson Choy, Douglas Coupland, Roddy Doyle, Richard Ford, Diana Gabaldon, Rawi Hage, Tomson Highway, Lawrence Hill, Nancy Huston, John Irving, Barbara Kingsolver, Dany Laferrière, Alexander McCall Smith, Annie Proulx, Mordecai Richler and David Suzuki.In 2010, Founding Festival Director Anne Green introduced Festival audiences to incoming Director Jo Steffens. While honoring the mandate of the Festival and continuing its legacy, Executive Director Jo Steffens launched new programming elements that encourage audiences to think differently about the literary landscape.Wordfest has recently presented writers in unscripted storytelling events; film and short-animation screenings about books and literary topics; curated presentations of essays inspired by online videos; live illustrations; and friendly competitions in which writers improvise a performance of their writing on-stage. These program innovations and others are designed to broaden the audience for the Festival and to foster an appreciation of the variety of forms in which the literary arts can beexperienced.April 2015, the Board of Directors of Wordfest announced Shelley Youngblut as the new General Director, to guide Wordfest through its 20th anniversary celebrations and into the Festivals third decade. Youngbluts dedication to fostering a generous, inclusive approach to arts presentation at Wordfest marshalled wide community support, inspired audiences and energized volunteers in the creation of a lively, public celebration of 20 years as the regions premier international readers and writers Festival.A strong advocate for high-quality community engagement, Youngblut comes to Wordfest from her previous positions as Western Editor of the Globe and Mail and founding editor of SWERVE, the Calgary Heralds award-winning weekly magazine. A well-known, creative ringleader, she is a regular member of the Unconventional Panel on CBC Calgary The Eyeopener, and recently curated the photography exhibit, Your Town is Our Town, at the Lougheed House Gallery. Youngblut is a past participant of The Banff Centre Literary Journalism, Wired Writing Studio and Arts Journalism programs, as well as the Stanford Professional Publishing Program.","Wordfest sparks lively, illuminating and meaningful conversations between Calgarys readers and the worlds most engaging writers.

Due perhaps in part to the recent presentation of the findings of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada and the launch of the national inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, we strongly perceive an unprecedented eagerness for understanding and connection with Indigenous communities through inspiring and informative live-audience presentations. Wordfest looks forward to renewing the expansion of its Indigenous Voices programming that began in 2015.New Focus on making Calgary THE Readers CityCalgary is beyond ready to offer a yearly destination weekend, in which readers can engage with a major literary figure. But to make this truly reflective of Calgary, we will use each authors essence as a lens through which we can showcase our citys unique creative and collaborative culture for its residents and visitors from all over the world.","Whether as a volunteer, an individual donor or a community partner, all contributions are valuable to Wordfest. They are an investment in our city, helping to build communities through a shared love of reading, writing, learning and exchanging ideas.Each year, more than 10,000 students experience the magic of interacting with live authors during Wordfest. Targeted contributions to Wordfests youth outreach programming help the Festival make our activities accessible to schools and parents who otherwise would not have the ability or resources to participate.Wordfest is also looking for donors and volunteers to help bring thousands of people of all ages together to share their passion for the literary arts and to promote the development of active, engaged citizens and healthy communities.

"254",593,"Yellowstone to Yukon Conservation Initiative Foundation","Why did the wolf cross the road? Or for that matter, not just the road, but the lands and waters of two Canadian provinces, three US states, numerous First Nations territories and countless private lands?Not everyone can tell their own story. But mapping the travels of a 5-year-old female grey wolf named Pluie helped to change our perspective on, and the face of, conservation.On a rainy June day in 1991, researchers in Kananaskis Country, Alberta, fitted Pluie with a radio-collar that went on to track her astonishing 100,000-square kilometre journey  more than 15 times the area of Banff National Park - over the next two years. Seeking out food and mates and trying to avoid the threats of civilization took her through Banff to British Columbia, and as far south as Montana, Idaho and Washington in the US.It was journeys like Pluies, and the growing scientific understanding that conservation needed to happen at a broader, transboundary scale  the scale at which animals use the landscape - that inspired conservationist and Y2Y founder Harvey Locke to first write the words Yellowstone to Yukon on a map in 1993.Scientists were finding that a whole range of species, from wolves to grizzly bears to fish and birds, were becoming isolated in protected pockets and struggling to migrate from one area to the next. This affected their ability to support themselves, to reproduce and to adapt to a changing landscape and climate. And that in turn was impacting not just their survival, but the balance of the whole ecosystem that they interacted with.The realization heralded the start of the collaborative Y2Y vision of an interconnected network of wild lands and waters in one of the worlds last remaining intact mountain ecosystems. That vision includes protecting not only the space needed for wildlife to roam, but clean air, clean water, and the integrity of the places we love to recreate in. For more than 20 years, Y2Y and its partners have been working hard and creatively to turn the vision into a reality.And for more than 20 years, Y2Y has been bringing together the people, ideas and resources to make the connections that will ensure that animals like Pluie, as well as our own children and grandchildren, will be able to live and thrive with one another in harmony.","Y2Y is the only organization dedicated to securing the long-term ecological health of the Yellowstone to Yukon region. We work with over 300 diverse partners to protect and connect natural habitat across the 3200km of wild lands and waters - which has Alberta and the Rockies at its heart - and to ensure that people and wildlife can live together in harmony and thrive.The region is a special place - home to the full suite of wildlife that was present when Europeans first arrived in North America; and the source of 13 major rivers, which provide clean, safe drinking water for more than 15 million people. It needs our best efforts, working together, to protect it.We take action - locally, regionally and internationally - to safeguard the clean water, pure air, rich forests and iconic wildlife that are at risk. We bring together the right people in the right places to develop and implement regional, scientifically-grounded conservation solutions at the right time. That includes the public, First Nations, conservation organizations, scientists, academics, outdoors groups, local businesses, industry and government agencies.Our AccomplishmentsThe Y2Y vision changed the way people thought about conservation  and it changed the scale and focus of conservation efforts. We started thinking at the continental landscape scale that matters to animals.And since 1993, the actions of Y2Y and its partnershave increased protected areas from 11 to 21 percent within the Yellowstone to Yukon region, while new management restrictions have improved conservation across an additional 30 percent of lands. This collective work has also ensured that more than 1000km of roadways are, or are being made, wildlife-friendly.Our 2015 Conservation Outcomes:Catalyzed the efforts of 118 partnersto enhance collective impact in theYellowstone to Yukon region.Collaborated on 67 conservationprojects that protect habitat andconnect wildlife throughout the region.Protected more than 250,000 ac (100,000 ha) of land in Albertas Castle watershed.Raised $326,000 to supportgrassroots projects.","Since this vision was first conceived in 1993, our progressin protecting the land, waters and wildlife of the Yellowstone to Yukon region - which includes so many places important to Calgarians - has been guided by science and achieved through close collaboration and bold, innovative programming. We lead efforts to protect wild lands and waters throughout this region, but we also carry out, coordinate and support numerous projects that help animals to survive and thrive in the spaces between protected areas, and to safeguard them as they move from one area to the next.We use eight key strategies:1.    Private Lands  working with willing property owners to secure and protect private lands that help maintain key wildlife corridors and habitat.2. Protected Areas and Public Lands identifying wildlife habitat that is at risk from development and find ways to protect it, such as helping to create new parks.3. Policy  helping to shape and create policies and practices that support our vision.4. Transportation  working to make busy roads (like the TransCanada Highway and Highway 3) safer for humans and wildlife, for example by installing fencing and crossings.5. Co-existence - supporting education and outreach programs and tools that help people share space with wildlife.6. Appropriate Development - supporting development that is consistent with our vision, and speaking out if it brings more damage than benefit.7. Habitat Restoration  working to heal damaged forests and streams in key wildlife areas.8. Promoting the Vision - promoting a connected landscape through our ever-growing networks and diverse businesses, scientists, non-profit groups and local communities.Several of our more local initiatives are outlined here, and many more can be found on our website.I. Protecting Alberta HeadwatersAlbertas mountain headwaters supply fresh water to millions of Albertans, provide key ecosystem services such as flood and drought control, support habitat that is home to wildlife including iconic grizzlies, wolverines and caribou, and offer year-round, awe-inspiring recreational opportunities.Y2Y has been leading conservation partners, outdoors groups, industry, local businesses and government agencies in efforts to safeguard our headwaters from inadequate protection and management, industrial development and over-use. Recent climatic conditions and events have reflected just how important it is that we find better ways to look after our watersheds.Find out more...II. Reducing Wildlife/Vehicle CollisionsHighways fragment wildlife habitat throughout the Y2Y region and can be major barriers to connectivity and survival. Not only are animals (and of course humans) killed or injured through collisions, but highways can block or deter them from moving to find food, mates and new or seasonal habitat.Highway 3 is just one of the busy highways that Y2Y is working to mitigate the impacts of. This east-west route south of Calgary helps up to 9,000 vehicles a day cut across the Rocky Mountains. The road also bisects an area of prime wildlife habitat, which is part of a north-south wildlife movement corridor for some of the regions most iconic species, such as grizzly bears, wolverines, cougars and bighorn mountain sheep. There is nothing to help them negotiate the trucks, cars and motorbikes that thunder along, and frequent wildlife/vehicle collisions are taking a heavy toll on both humans and animals.Y2Y is supporting Alberta initiatives around Crowsnest Pass and Rock Creek to help wildlife cross the road safely and to warn drivers of the dangers.Find out more...III. Supporting Cutting-Edge Climate Change ProgramsThe Crown of the Continent is one of the largest and most intact natural ecosystems in North America, and incorporates many of Calgarians beloved back-yard recreational areas. The Crown of the Continent Conservation Initiative (CCCI) is a partnership between 14 leading conservation organizations, hosted by Y2Y, who work together on progressive, scientifically-based, large-landscape conservation and connectivity, through a climate change lens. CCCI also engages with community members, tribes and government agencies.Having identified gaps in our approach to conservation through a comprehensive Climate Impacts Assessment, CCCI is now forging ahead with on-the-ground projects to support the resilience of our water sources, lands and wildlife in the face of changing environmental conditions.Find out more...","Be a part of the Y2Y vision and help protect and connect this iconic region and its wildlife forever!

We exist to help children, youth and adults live healthy lives, build community and provide leadership training and opportunities for our young people. Sometimes a little help can make all the difference.It made a difference for Monika and her family.Monika started exercising at Shawnessy YMCA after she gave birth to her twin boys, Adrian and Max. She was motivated to get back into shape and her daughter Claudia, seven at the time, already loved learning and making friends at swimming lessons and kids programs at the Y, so Monika knew her boys would too. Having the whole family in one place for activities made things easier for her.She started volunteering in a toddler program.It was the perfect opportunity to keep my babies with me during my shift and raise active, healthy, social children.When my boys started school, I switched to volunteering on the weight floor. But as our financial woes grew, I had to make the heartbreaking decision to stop going to the Y. I couldntt afford the babysitting costs or other activities for my kids.One day, I received a phone call from Christy, one of the trainers, wondering why I was no longer coming. When I explained our situation she invited me to talk to Nancy about financial assistance. Nancy was kind and understanding. As soon as a subsidy was in place, my kids and I returned to the Y. We were so excited to get back. We always felt welcomed and cared for at the YMCA and my children had so much fun.But life kept getting harder, my daughter was diagnosed with juvenile arthritis, my twenty year marriage ended, my gym bag was stolen and I had a medical emergency while exercising at the YMCA that resulted in an ambulance ride and seven hours at the hospital.Through all of this, the YMCA has been there for my family. They noticed when I wasnt there and invited me back. When my gym bag was stolen, Christy and Nancy gave me a new gym bag and a gift certificate to buy new workout clothes. When I was rushed to the hospital, Christy followed the ambulance and stayed to comfort me while I was treated by the doctors and then drove me home.Since our first time at Shawnessy YMCA, my children and I have been treated with kindness and encouragement. The staff at the Y have become our extended family and helped us overcome financial, life, and health problems.","Our mission is to facilitate and promote the spiritual, mental, physical and social development of individuals and to foster a sense of responsibility within the community.

"256",651,"Youth Central Society","Four years ago, Mallory Gibbons was pretty sure she wasnt going to graduate high school. She was shy and uncomfortable with herself, and her choice of friends was getting her in trouble. She needed to re-direct her focus.Thats where Youth Central came in. Mallory joined the Youth Volunteer Corps club at Discovering Choices High School. She saw an opportunity to do something positive and to make a difference in her school and community.In the following years, Mallory helped to facilitate fundraisers, volunteer with various city organizations, and organize student activities. The club became a fundamental part of the school and its culture, and Mallory became a leader. Its the highlight of her week and something to always look forward to.Shes now able to articulate and implement ideas with confidence and conviction. Shes self-assured and is comfortable stepping outside of her comfort zone, readily accepting any challenge thrown her way. And shes graduating high school this year, an accomplishment she credits Youth Central in helping her achieve by giving her the motivation she needed.","Imagine a city that is filled with young people that are community-minded, active citizens that want change and will take action. Youth Central ensures this generation and all future generations are engaged, empathetic, caring team players who have a sense of ownership and responsibility.Youth Central is a dynamic and creative non-profit charitable organization with the mission to inspire, engage and celebrate youth through community participation. We have a vision that all youth participate in shaping a vibrant community. Often, youth are undervalued and underestimated for what they can offer to the community and even negatively stereotyped. Through Youth Central, young people are engaged in the community and given a voice; celebrated for what they bring to the community; and inspired to do even more for our city.In 1992, the original concept of a child-friendly organization in Calgary was that of developing diverse opportunities for children and youth to get involved and have a voice in their communities. Over the years, the organization has grown into a leader in youth engagement and youth volunteerism, winning various community awards for its programs.We provide a place for youth to find meaningful volunteer experiences. We help youth make a difference and be active caring citizens. We support youth in building valuable skills for future employment. We give youth a voice.

YVC works with 179 agencies in our city that rely on Youth Centrals volunteers to help with their events and initiatives year-round.Through Youth Centrals programs, youth learn about the community and its diverse needs and issues, [youth] volunteer as a team with various community agencies to make a difference, join a foundation and learn about philanthropy and granting, serve on various leadership committees, plan community events, blog about community issues, vote for Calgarys Mayor, and voice their opinions to community leaders. Young people do not always know where to start to find a volunteer opportunity, are overwhelmed by the choices, or have a great idea to make our city more vibrant, but they are unsure who to share it with or how to make it happen.Youth Central makes it easy as a one-stop-shop for youth volunteering and community engagement.

"257",599,"Youth Singers of Calgary (YSC)","Thirty years ago at Mount Royal Conservatory, Shirley Penner was asked to design a junior high choir for 26 students. Penner merged classically-based singing with dancing and acting, and the class soon took on a life of its own.Within a few years, this class grew to 80 students; however, the Conservatory was only able to accommodate one class. I had to make a decision. I stayed, working on funddevelopment at the college, but I took the Youth Singers out into the community, says Shirley Penner, CEO of YouthSingers of Calgary.After relocating a few times, the fledgling company found ahome in Victoria Park Community Centre where it remained for 12 years, growing into one of the largest not-for-profitchoral organizations in the country. Having outgrown thecommunity centre, and after countless volunteer hours as wellas donations from their supporters, in 2009 Youth Singers renovateda warehouse and relocated to its new Performing Arts YouthCentre in the southeast.The 18,000-square-foot space houses four studios, a soundroom, set and costume storage, and a priceless library of music titles. The space is simple, functional and solid, much like theorganization itself.The important thing is what happens inside the building, saysPenner.Its the young people! Building self-esteem and confidenceand giving them all the opportunities to lead and grow.Performers have fun while earning high school credits andlearning important life skills: time management, organization and teamwork. They learn to win with grace, work hard andmake lifelong friends who share a love of music. And theyve learned from the best.Shirley Penner was recently inductedinto The Alberta Order of Excellence for her contribution and impact on the arts and the community. She has had an impacton more than 3000 performers in the three decades Youth Singers has operated.","Youth Singers of Calgary creates great performers on stage and in life.When a Youth Singer steps on stage, they give it everything theyve got - their personalities, their dreams, their fears and their excitement. Their true voices come tumbling out and their love of performing, of growing and succeeding shines through. Their passion and enthusiasm captivate and elevate their audiences as well as each other.For some Youth Singers, rehearsals and shows are an extension of an already healthy, balanced life. For others, they find an escape from the increasing stresses of being a kid, and discover opportunities to spark motivation otherwise lost behind the glow of their tablet or phone.The tools we use to produce better performers allow us to develop people who feel better about themselves and who see that the sky really is the limit on their dreams. Every day, we create community leaders empowered by the experiences and personal growth they achieve through singing, dancing and acting.We are one of Calgarys largest performing arts organizations. For more than 30 years, guided by the vision and leadership of founder Shirley Penner, we have provided generations of young people with a chance to succeed through the performing arts.

Next year our SENIOR HI and older divisions will be going to South Africa!Our performers are mentored and continuously challenged to learn and grow artistically.

"258",457,"YouthLink Calgary Police Interpretive Centre","Quite simply, Tessa, a grade six student from Calgary, was a bully. More than a bully, she was a terror; her classmates were afraid of her. She intimidated her teachers. Even her mother didnt know what to do with her. She was described as the most narcissistic 12 year old you could ever meet.But despite being a bully, inside she was a lonely, isolated, and confused little girl. She didnt understand why she didnt have any friends, why her teachers avoided her, and why she couldnt turn to her mother for help. There was no doubt Tessa was a bully, and there was no doubt she needed help.Thankfully for Tessa, she was introduced to YouthLink. A place where Calgarys youth have access to the resources they need to help them navigate lifes tough situations and help them make the right decisions.At YouthLink, students are exposed to real life stories of bullies, their victims and bystanders. These stories come from Calgary schoolyards, classrooms, and sports fields and feature all types of bullying  physical, emotional and online bullying  and how YouthLink provided guidance, counsel and solutions to the youth involved.Weve all met someone like Tessa.
